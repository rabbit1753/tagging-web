Leo and Ben were good friends.
One day, Leo wanted to take a trip, and Leo asked Ben to go along with Leo.
On the day that Leo and Ben were about to set off, Ben started to worry, "What should Leo and Ben do if other birds come and destroy Leo and Ben nests while Leo and Ben are away?"
Leo thought for a few seconds.
Leo then said, "If destroy's happened, then Leo and Ben could rebuild Leo and Ben nest and make even greater and more MARVELOUS ones!"
"Leo always look on the bright side," said Ben with a smile.
On Leo and Ben way, Ben and Leo stopped to take a little rest.
Suddenly, the sky turned gray and it started to rain.
Ben frowned and said, "Oh no! It seems like there is a storm coming! Leo and Ben'll never find a safe place to hide."
Leo then thought for a few seconds. " Maybe there are some other owls' nests around here and Leo and Ben can ask some other owls' to give Leo and Ben shelter during the storm."
"Leo always have such a positive attitude," Said Ben.
After a while, the rain stopped, but Ben sighed: "The storm has slowed Leo and Ben down."
Leo looked up at the sky and Leo thought for a few seconds.
"But, look over there! Leo and Ben get the chance to see such a BEAUTIFUL rainbow!" said Leo cheerfully and excitedly.
"Yeah, such a BEAUTIFUL rainbow's really beautiful!" said Ben.
When Leo and Ben returned home from Leo and Ben trip, Leo and Ben saw Leo and Ben nests were the same and so were Leo and Ben friends.
"Here Leo and Ben are back to Leo and Ben old life again. How boring!"
"There is nothing new and special," sighed Ben.
Leo thought for a few seconds and replied calmly, "Well. Leo think it's great hanging out with old friends who really know you."
Ben hooted and said, "Ben really adore Leo for having such a positive attitude toward EVERYTHING!"
Always try to look on the bright side.
