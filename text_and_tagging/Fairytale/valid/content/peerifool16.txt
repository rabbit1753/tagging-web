so she was quite cheerful and happy , for she felt certain that she was clever enough to outwit the giant , if only she were watchful and patient ; so she lay quite quietly in her creel above the cabbages , but she kept her eyes very wide open to see by which road he was carrying her off . and when he set her down in his kitchen , and told her all that he expected her to do , she did not look downcast like her sisters , but nodded her head brightly , and said that she felt sure that she could do it . and she sang to herself as she drove the cow over the moor to pasture , and she ran the whole way back , so that she should have a good long afternoon to work at the wool , and , although she would not have told the giant this , to search the house .
