presently the fairies noticed him , and , instead of being angry at his boldness in entering their abode , as he expected that they would be , they seemed very pleased to see him , and invited him to a seat at the table . but by and by they grew rude and insolent , and jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , telling him that they saw everything that went on at the castle , and making fun of the old butler , whom the page loved with all his heart . and they laughed at the food he ate , saying that it was only fit for animals ; and when any fresh dainty was set on the table by the scarlet - clad pages , they would push the dish across to him , saying : " taste it , for you will not have the chance of tasting such things at the castle . " at last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer ; besides , he knew that if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so . so he suddenly stood up , and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand . " i 'll drink to you all in water , " he cried , and instantly the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water . he raised the cup to his lips , but he did not drink from it . with a sudden jerk he threw the water over the candles , and instantly the room was in darkness . then , clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms , he sprang to the opening of the knowe , through which he could see the stars glimmering clearly . he was just in time , for it fell to with a crash behind him ; and soon he was speeding along the wet , dew - spangled moor , with the whole troop of fairies at his heels . they were wild with rage , and from the shrill shouts of fury which they uttered , the page knew well that , if they overtook him , he need expect no mercy at their hands . and his heart began to sink , for , fleet of foot though he was , he was no match for the fairy folk , who gained on him steadily .
