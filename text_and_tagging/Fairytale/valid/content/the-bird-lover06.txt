at last the widow began herself to have a suspicion that her daughter 's heart was in the wood , from her long delays in returning , and the little success she had in gathering the fire - branches for which she went in search . in answer to her mother 's questions , minda revealed the truth , and made known her lover 's request . the mother , considering the lonely and destitute condition of her little household , gave her consent . the daughter , with light steps , hastened with the news to the wood . the bird lover of course heard it with delight , and fluttered through the air in happy circles , and poured forth a song of joy which thrilled minda to the heart . he said that he would come to the lodge at sunset , and immediately took wing , while minda hung fondly upon his flight , till he was lost far away in the blue sky . with the twilight the bird lover , whose name was monedowa , appeared at the door of the lodge , as a hunter , with a red plume and a mantle of blue upon his shoulders . he addressed the widow as his friend , and she directed him to sit down beside her daughter , and they were regarded as man and wife . early on the following morning , he asked for the bow and arrows of those who had been slain by the wicked manito , and went out a - hunting . as soon as he had got out of sight of the lodge , he changed himself into the wood - bird , as he had been before his marriage , and took his flight through the air .
