now the king and his counsellors liked not this advice , for they hated the sorcerer , who had , as they thought , too much influence with the queen ; but they were at their wits ' end , and knew not to whom to turn for help , so they were fain to do as she said and summon the wizard before them . and when he obeyed the summons and appeared in their midst , they liked him none the better for his looks . for he was long , and thin , and awesome , with a beard that came down to his knee , and hair that wrapped him about like a mantle , and his face was the colour of mortar , as if he had always lived in darkness , and had been afraid to look on the sun . but there was no help to be found in any other man , so they laid the case before him , and asked him what they should do . and he answered coldly that he would think over the matter , and come again to the assembly the following day and give them his advice . and his advice , when they heard it , was like to turn their hair white with horror .
