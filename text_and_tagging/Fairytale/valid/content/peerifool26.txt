and , when she had finished her bread and milk , she went and laid down by the side of a green knowe , which rose out of the moor not very far from the byre door . and , strange to say , as she lay there she felt the earth beneath her getting warmer and warmer , until she was so hot that she was fain to crawl up the side of the hillock , in the hope of getting a mouthful of fresh air . and as she got near the top she heard a voice , which seemed to come from somewhere beneath her , saying , " tease , teasens , tease ; card , cardens , card ; spin , spinnens , spin ; for peerifool peerifool , peerifool is what men call me . " and when she got to the very top , she found that there was a crack in the earth , through which rays of light were coming ; and when she put her eye to the crack , what should she see down below her but a brilliantly lighted chamber , in which all the peerie folk were sitting in a circle , working away as hard as they could .
