the string was easy to untie , and the king 's son soon unfastened the bundle . what was it he saw there ? why , a great castle with an orchard all about it , and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind . it was all ready for him to dwell in , but instead of being in the midst of the forest , he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had reached the green valley close to his father 's palace . well , it was no use wishing , and with a sigh he glanced up , and beheld a huge giant coming towards him . ' bad is the place where thou hast built thy house , king 's son , ' said the giant . ' true ; it is not here that i wish to be , ' answered the king 's son . ' what reward wilt thou give me if i put it back in the bundle ? ' asked the giant . ' what reward dost thou ask ? ' answered the king 's son . ' the first boy thou hast when he is seven years old , ' said the giant . ' if i have a boy thou shalt get him , ' answered the king 's son , and as he spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again . ' now take thy road , and i will take mine , ' said the giant . ' and if thou forgettest thy promise , i will remember it . '
