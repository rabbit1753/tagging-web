the blue - grey mare galloped on like the wind , and the next day the king 's son came in sight of his father 's house . ' get down and go in , ' said the bride , ' and tell them that thou hast married me . but take heed that neither man nor beast kiss thee , for then thou wilt cease to remember me at all . ' ' i will do thy bidding , ' answered he , and left her at the gate . all who met him bade him welcome , and he charged his father and mother not to kiss him , but as he greeted them his old greyhound leapt on his neck , and kissed him on the mouth . and after that he did not remember the giant 's daughter .
