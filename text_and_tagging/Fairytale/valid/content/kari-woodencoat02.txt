once , as she sat there and cried and was sad , he came to her again , and asked why she was so unhappy . she did not answer him but kept on weeping . " well , i know what your trouble is , " said the bull , " even though you will not tell me . you are weeping because the queen is so unkind to you , and would gladly starve you to death . but you need not worry about food , for in my left ear is a cloth and , if you will take it out and spread it , you can have as much as you want to eat . " she did so , took out the cloth , laid it on the grass , and it was at once covered with the finest dishes one might desire : bread and mead and honey - cake . then she soon regained her strength , and grew so plump , and so rose and white complexioned that the queen and her daughter , who was as thin as a rail , turned green and yellow with envy . the queen could not understand how it was that her step - daughter came to look so well in spite of such poor fare . so she told a maid to follow her to the forest , and watch and see how it came about ; for she thought some of the servants secretly gave her food . the maid followed her into the forest , and watched carefully , and saw how the step - daughter drew the cloth out of the blue bull 's left ear , and spread it out , and how it covered itself with the finest dishes , and also how the king 's daughter ate heartily . and the maid told the queen at home about it .
