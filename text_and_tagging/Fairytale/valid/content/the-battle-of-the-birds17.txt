now the king of the country was about to marry , and the young men about the court thronged the shoemaker 's shop to buy fine shoes to wear at the wedding . ' thou hast a pretty daughter , ' said they when they beheld the girl sitting at work . ' pretty she is , ' answered the shoemaker , ' but no daughter of mine . ' ' i would give a hundred pounds to marry her , ' said one . ' and i , ' ' and i , ' cried the others . ' that is no business of mine , ' answered the shoemaker , and the young men bade him ask her if she would choose one of them for a husband , and to tell them on the morrow . then the shoemaker asked her , and the girl said that she would marry the one who would bring his purse with him . so the shoemaker hurried to the youth who had first spoken , and he came back , and after giving the shoemaker a hundred pounds for his news , he sought the girl , who was waiting for him . ' is it thou ? ' inquired she . ' i am thirsty , give me a drink from the well that is yonder . ' and he poured out the water , but he could not move from the place where he was ; and there he stayed till many hours had passed by . ' take away that foolish boy , ' cried the girl to the shoemaker at last , ' i am tired of him , ' and then suddenly he was able to walk , and betook himself to his home , but he did not tell the others what had happened to him .
