there was once a king and a queen in rousay who had three daughters . when the young princesses were just grown up , the king died , and the crown passed to a distant cousin , who had always hated him , and who paid no heed to the widowed queen and her daughters . so they were left very badly off , and they went to live in a tiny cottage , and did all the housework themselves . they had a kailyard in front of the cottage , and a little field behind it , and they had a cow that grazed in the field , and which they fed with the cabbages that grew in the kailyard . for everyone knows that to feed cows with cabbages makes them give a larger quantity of milk . but they soon discovered that some one was coming at night and stealing the cabbages , and , of course , this annoyed them very much . for they knew that if they had not cabbages to give to the cow , they would not have enough milk to sell .
