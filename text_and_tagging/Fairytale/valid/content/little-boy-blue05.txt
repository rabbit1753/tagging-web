" " very well , " replied the squire , " it shall be as you say , and if he is attentive and watchful he will be able to save me a good bit of trouble and so really earn his money . " then he turned to the child and said , " come to me in the morning , my little man , and i will give you a silver horn to blow , that you may call the sheep and the cows whenever they go astray . what is your name ?
