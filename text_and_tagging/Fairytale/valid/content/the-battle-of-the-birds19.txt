up they went to the castle , and when the young men saw the girl standing there , they led her into the hall where the banquet was laid out and poured her out some wine . she was just raising the glass to drink when a flame went up out of it , and out of the flame sprang two pigeons , one of gold and one of silver . they flew round and round the head of the girl , when three grains of barley fell on the floor , and the silver pigeon dived down , and swallowed them . ' if thou hadst remembered how i cleaned the byre , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon , and as he spoke three more grains fell , and the silver pigeon ate them as before . ' if thou hadst remembered how i thatched the byre , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon again ; and as he spoke three more grains fell , and for the third time they were eaten by the silver pigeon . ' if thou hadst remembered how i got the magpie 's nest , thou wouldst have given me my share , ' cooed the golden pigeon . then the king 's son understood that they had come to remind him of what he had forgotten , and his lost memory came back , and he knew his wife , and kissed her . but as the preparations had been made , it seemed a pity to waste them , so they were married a second time , and sat down to the wedding feast .
