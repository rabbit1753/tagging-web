never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful , and he could not but look at her , for she was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft radiance . when princess moonlight became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room , but the emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say . her only answer was to hide her face in her sleeves . the emperor fell deeply in love with her , and begged her to come to the court , where he would give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for . he was about to send for one of the imperial palanquins to take her back with him at once , saying that her grace and beauty should adorn a court , and not be hidden in a bamboo - cutter 's cottage .
