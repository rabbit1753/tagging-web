after that the prince went to church , and kari also begged permission to go . the people asked her why she wanted to go to church , since she had nothing to wear but her ugly , black wooden coat . but kari said the pastor preached so beautifully that she loved to listen to him , and finally they allowed her to go . she went to the wall of rock and knocked , and the man came out and gave her a dress that was far handsomer than the first ; it was embroidered all over with silver , and gleamed like the silver forest ; and she also received a splendid horse , with housings embroidered with silver , and a silver bridle . when the king 's daughter came to the church , the people were still standing before the church door . in their astonishment they all asked each other who she might be , and the prince came running up at once , and wanted to hold her horse while she dismounted . but she jumped right down , and said it would not be necessary , since the horse was so tame that it would stand still when she commanded , and come to her if she wished .
