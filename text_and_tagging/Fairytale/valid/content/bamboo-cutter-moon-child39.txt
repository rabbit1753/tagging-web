" the time has come , " he said , " for princess moonlight to return to the moon from whence she came . she committed a grave fault , and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time . we know what good care you have taken of the princess , and we have rewarded you for this and have sent you wealth and prosperity . we put the gold in the bamboos for you to find . " " i have brought up this princess for twenty years and never once has she done a wrong thing , therefore the lady you are seeking can not be this one , " said the old man . " i pray you to look elsewhere . " then the messenger called aloud , saying : " princess moonlight , come out from this lowly dwelling . rest not here another moment . "
