the squire himself was returning from a long , weary ride over his farms , and when he came to the cornfield and saw the cows trampling down the grain and feeding upon the golden stalks he was very angry . " little boy blue ! " he cried ; " ho ! little boy blue , come blow your horn ! " but there was no reply . he rode on a way and now discovered that the sheep were deep within the meadows , and that made him more angry still . " here , isaac , " he said to a farmer 's lad who chanced to pass by , " where is little boy blue ? " " he 's under the hay - stack , your honor , fast asleep ! " replied isaac with a grin , for he had passed that way and seen that the boy was lying asleep . " will you go and wake him ? " asked the squire ; " for he must drive out the sheep and the cows before they do more damage . "
