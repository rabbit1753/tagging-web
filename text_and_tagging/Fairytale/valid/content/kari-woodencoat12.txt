" but when they entered the forest , it was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through . she was as careful as she could be , and avoided the branches , and thrust them aside with her hands ; but the branches struck her in the face each moment , and in spite of all her care a leaf did remain in her hand . " alas , alas ! " cried the bull . " what have you done ! now i must fight for my very life , for the troll with six heads is twice as strong as the first one ; but see that you take care of the leaf and keep it carefully ! "
