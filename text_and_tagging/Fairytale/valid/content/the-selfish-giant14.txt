" cried the giant ; " tell me , that i may take my big sword and slay him . " " nay ! " answered the child ; " but these are the wounds of love . " " who art thou ? " said the giant , and a strange awe fell on him , and he knelt before the little child . and the child smiled on the giant , and said to him , " you let me play once in your garden , to - day you shall come with me to my garden , which is paradise . " and when the children ran in that afternoon , they found the giant lying dead under the tree , all covered with white blossoms .
