" bakah ! bakah ! nejee ! " he called out to monedowa ; " stop , my friend , i wish to talk to you . " monedowa laughed aloud as he replied : " i will speak to you at the starting - post . when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " one more flight as the blue bird with red wings , and monedowa was so near to the goal that he could easily reach it in his mortal shape . shining in beauty , his face lighted up like the sky , with tinted arms and bosom gleaming in the sun , and the parti - colored plume on his brow waving in the wind . monedowa , cheered by a joyful shout from his own people , leaped to the post . the manito came on with fear in his face . " my friend , " he said , " spare my life ; " and then added , in a low voice , as if he would not that the others should hear it , " give me to live . " and he began to move off as if the request had been granted . " as you have done to others , " replied monedowa , " so shall it be done to you . " and seizing the wicked manito , he dashed him against the pillar of stone . his kindred , who were looking on in horror , raised a cry of fear and fled away in a body to some distant land , whence they have never returned .
