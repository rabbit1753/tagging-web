when she left the church , the prince came after her , and closed the church door behind her , and kept one of the gloves she wore in his hand . and then when she wanted to mount her horse , the prince came again , and asked her where she came from . " from washwaterland ! " said kari , and while the prince pulled out the glove and wanted to give it to her , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! " the prince had never yet seen such a handsome glove , and he traveled far , looking for the native land of the noble lady who had abandoned her glove , but no one could tell him where it might be . the following sunday some one had to go up to the prince , and bring him a towel . " can not i go up ? " begged kari . " is that all you want ? " said the rest in the kitchen . " you saw yourself what happened to you the last time ! " but kari kept on asking , and finally she received permission , after all , and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat fairly clattered . the prince at once thrust his head out of the door , and when he saw that it was kari , he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her head . " off with you , you horrid creature ! " cried he . " do you think i want a towel that you have touched with your dirty fingers ? "
