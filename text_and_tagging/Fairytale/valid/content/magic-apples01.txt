once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others . he was never short of money , for he had a purse which was never empty . he never was short of food , for he had a table - cloth on which , as soon as he spread it , he found all he wanted to eat and drink . and , besides , he had a magic wishing cap . when he put it on he could wish himself wherever he wanted , and there he would be that very moment . there was only one thing that he lacked : he had no wife , and he was gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to make haste .
