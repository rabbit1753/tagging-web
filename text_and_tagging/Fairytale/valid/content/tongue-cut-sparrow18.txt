the lady sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change , but the old man said he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at his not coming home at the usual time - and to his work , and there - fore , much as he wished to do so , he could not accept her kind invitation . but now that he knew where the lady sparrow lived he would come to see her whenever he had the time . when the lady sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer , she gave an order to some of her servants , and they at once brought in two boxes , one large and the other small . these were placed before the old man , and the lady sparrow asked him to choose whichever he liked for a present , which she wished to give him .
