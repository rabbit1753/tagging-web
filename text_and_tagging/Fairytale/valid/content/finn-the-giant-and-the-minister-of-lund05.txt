when st . lawrence heard that he was happy ; for now he knew the giant 's name . he ran back quickly to town , and went to the church . there sat the giant on the roof , just about to set the last stone in place , when at that very moment the saint called out : " finn , finn , take care how you put the stone in ! " then the giant flung the stone from him , full of rage , said that the church should never be finished , and with that he disappeared . since then something has always been missing from the church .
