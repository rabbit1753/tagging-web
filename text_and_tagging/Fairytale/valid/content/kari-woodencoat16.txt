but now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up , and he was so frightful that the king 's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him . " who has touched my forest ? " he shouted . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and with this they rushed on each other , so that it was a fearsome sight , and the king 's daughter nearly fainted . the bull gored the troll through and through with his horns ; but the troll was as strong as he , and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads , the others breathed fresh life into it , and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him . but then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit . his whole body was covered with wounds ; and he could not even tell the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll 's girdle and anoint him with the salve . but she did so of her own accord , and then he recovered again . yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks , until he was able to go on again .
