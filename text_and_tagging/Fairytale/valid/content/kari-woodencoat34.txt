when the sermon was over , and the king 's daughter left the church , the prince had poured tar on the floor of the vestibule , so that he might have a chance to help the king 's daughter across . but she paid no attention to it , stepped right into the middle of the tar , and leaped over . but one of her golden shoes stuck fast , and when she had mounted her horse , the prince came running out of the church and asked her whence she came . " from combland ! " she answered . but when the prince wanted to hand her the golden shoe , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! " and again the prince did not know where she had gone , and he wandered about the world a long time , looking for combland ; but since no one could tell him where it might be , he let it be known that he would marry the girl whose foot the golden shoe fitted . then the handsome and the homely came scurrying up from the ends of the earth ; but none of them had a foot so small that they could put on the golden shoe . at last kari 's evil stepmother and her daughter also came , and the shoe fitted the latter . but she was very homely , and looked so unsatisfactory that the prince kept his promise most unwillingly . notwithstanding , preparations were made for the wedding , and she was adorned with her bridal finery , but when they rode to church , a little bird sat in a tree and sang : " a bit of the heel , and a bit of the toe , kari woodencoat 's shoe is filled with blood , i know !
