once , as she sat there and cried and was sad , he came to her again , and asked why she was so unhappy . she did not answer him but kept on weeping . " well , i know what your trouble is , " said the bull , " even though you will not tell me . you are weeping because the queen is so unkind to you , and would gladly starve you to death . but you need not worry about food , for in my left ear is a cloth and , if you will take it out and spread it , you can have as much as you want to eat . " she did so , took out the cloth , laid it on the grass , and it was at once covered with the finest dishes one might desire : bread and mead and honey - cake . then she soon regained her strength , and grew so plump , and so rose and white complexioned that the queen and her daughter , who was as thin as a rail , turned green and yellow with envy . the queen could not understand how it was that her step - daughter came to look so well in spite of such poor fare . so she told a maid to follow her to the forest , and watch and see how it came about ; for she thought some of the servants secretly gave her food . the maid followed her into the forest , and watched carefully , and saw how the step - daughter drew the cloth out of the blue bull 's left ear , and spread it out , and how it covered itself with the finest dishes , and also how the king 's daughter ate heartily . and the maid told the queen at home about it . now the king came home , and he had defeated the other king , against whom he had warred ; and the whole castle was overjoyed , and none was more joyful than the king 's daughter . but the queen pretended to be ill , and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat . the king 's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do , and pleaded for the bull ; for all liked him , and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom . but no , he must be slaughtered , and he should be slaughtered , and there was no help for it . when the king 's daughter heard this , she felt sad , and went into the stable to the bull . he stood and hung his head , and looked so mournful that she could not keep from weeping . " why do you weep ? " asked the bull . then she told him that the king had come home , and that the queen had pretended to be ill , and had forced the physician to say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat , and that now he was to be slaughtered . " once she has done away with me , it will not be long before she does away with you , " said the bull . " but if it suits you , we will run away from here to - night . " the king 's daughter did say that it would be bad enough to leave her father , but that at the same time it would be worse to remain under the same roof with the queen , and so she promised the bull to go with him .
