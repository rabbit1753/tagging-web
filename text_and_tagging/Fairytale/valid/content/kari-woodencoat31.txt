off she was , and the prince did not know what had become of her . he wandered about in the world , far and wide , looking for her native land . but no one could tell him where it might be , and with that the prince finally had to content himself . the following sunday some one was to go up to the prince , and bring him a comb . kari begged that they would let her go , but the others reminded her of what had happened the last time , and scolded her for showing herself to the prince , ugly as she was , and in her wooden coat . but she kept on asking , and finally they let her go with the comb . when she once more came clattering up the stairs , the prince thrust his head out of the door , tore the comb from her hand , and shouted at her to be off . then the prince went to church , and kari wanted to go as well . the rest again asked her why she wanted to go to church , ugly as she was , since she did not even have clothes fit to appear in before other people . the prince , or some one else might happen to see her , and that would mean unhappiness for herself and others . but kari said that the people would have other things to look at besides herself , and finally they let her go .
