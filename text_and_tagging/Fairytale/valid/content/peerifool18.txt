she did so , and exactly the same fate befell her that had befallen her elder sister . the giant appeared with his creel , and he carried her off , and set her to mind the cow and the house , and to make his porridge and to spin ; and the little yellow - headed peerie folk appeared and asked her for some supper , and she refused to give it to them ; and after that , she could not comb or card her wool , and the giant was angry , and he scolded her , and beat her , and threw her up , half dead , on the joists beside her sister and the hens . then the youngest princess determined to sit out in the kailyard all night , not so much to see what was becoming of the cabbages , as to discover what had happened to her sisters . and when the giant came and carried her off , she was not at all sorry , but very glad , for she was a brave and loving little maiden ; and now she felt that she had a chance of finding out where they were , and whether they were dead or alive . so she was quite cheerful and happy , for she felt certain that she was clever enough to outwit the giant , if only she were watchful and patient ; so she lay quite quietly in her creel above the cabbages , but she kept her eyes very wide open to see by which road he was carrying her off . and when he set her down in his kitchen , and told her all that he expected her to do , she did not look downcast like her sisters , but nodded her head brightly , and said that she felt sure that she could do it . and she sang to herself as she drove the cow over the moor to pasture , and she ran the whole way back , so that she should have a good long afternoon to work at the wool , and , although she would not have told the giant this , to search the house .
