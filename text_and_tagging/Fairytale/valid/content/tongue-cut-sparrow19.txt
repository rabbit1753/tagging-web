the old man could not refuse this kind proposal , and he chose the smaller box , saying : " i am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box . as you are so kind as to say that i may take whichever i like , i will choose the small one , which will be easier for me to carry . " then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding him good - by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time . thus the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily , the sparrow showing not the least ill - will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife . indeed , she only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life .
