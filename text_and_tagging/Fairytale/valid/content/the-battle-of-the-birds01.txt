there was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and the birds of the air . news of it went abroad , and the son of the king of tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see it , and would bring back word who was to be king . but in spite of that , he was almost too late , and every fight had been fought save the last , which was between a snake and a great black raven . both struck hard , but in the end the snake proved the stronger , and would have twisted himself round the neck of the raven till he died had not the king 's son drawn his sword , and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow . and when the raven beheld that his enemy was dead , he was grateful , and said : ' for thy kindness to me this day , i will show thee a sight . so come up now on the root of my two wings . ' the king 's son did as he was bid , and before the raven stopped flying , they had passed over seven bens and seven glens and seven mountain moors . ' do you see that house yonder ? ' said the raven at last . ' go straight for it , for a sister of mine dwells there , and she will make you right welcome . and if she asks , " wert thou at the battle of the birds ? " answer that thou wert , and if she asks , " didst thou see my likeness ? " answer that thou sawest it , but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place . '
