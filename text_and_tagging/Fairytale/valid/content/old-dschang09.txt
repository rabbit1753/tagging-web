said old dschang : " i have only remained here because i thought you would long for your daughter . but since you are tired of us , i will be glad to go . i have a little country house back in the hills , and we will set out for it early to - morrow morning . " the following morning , at break of dawn , old dschang came with his wife to say farewell . sir we said : " should we long to see you at some later time , my son can make inquiries . " old dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear . he himself took his staff and walked after . a few years passed without any news from either of them . then sir we and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries . when the latter got back in the hills he met a plow - boy who was plowing with two yellow steers . he asked him : " where is old dschang 's country house ? " the plow - boy left the plow in the harrow , bowed and answered : " you have been a long time coming , sir ! the village is not far from here : i will show you the way . "
