when the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual , for it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time . " where have you been all this time ? " she asked in a big voice . " why do you come back so late ? " the old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with him , and then he told her of all that had happened to him , and how wonderfully he had been entertained at the sparrow 's house .
