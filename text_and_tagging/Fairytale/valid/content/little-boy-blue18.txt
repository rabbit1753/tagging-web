" not i , " replied isaac , " if i wake him he 'll surely cry , for he is but a baby , and not fit to mind the sheep . but i myself will drive them out for your honor , " and away he ran to do so , thinking that now the squire would give him little boy blue 's place , and make him the shepherd boy , for isaac had long coveted the position . the squire 's daughter , hearing the angry tones of her father 's voice , now came out to see what was amiss , and when she heard that little boy blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved , for she had loved the child for his pretty ways . the squire dismounted from his horse and came to where the boy was lying . " awake ! " said he , shaking him by the shoulder , " and depart from my lands , for you have betrayed my trust , and let the sheep and the cows stray into the fields and meadows ! "
