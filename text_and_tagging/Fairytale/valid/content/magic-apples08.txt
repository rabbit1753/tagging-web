after they had eaten , the king 's daughter said : " o , do look at the handsome apples up there on the tree ! if you were really kind , you would fetch me down a couple of them ! " the youth was not lazy , and climbed up . but he had forgotten his table - cloth and his purse , and these she took . and while he was shaking down the apples his cap fell off . she at once put it on and wished herself back in her own room , and there she was that minute . " you might have known it , " said the youth to himself , and hurried down the tree . he began to cry and did not know what to do . and as he was sitting there , he sampled the apples which he had thrown down . no sooner had he tried one than he had a strange feeling in his head , and when he looked more closely , he had a pair of horns . " well , now it can do me no more harm , " said he , and calmly went on eating the apples . but suddenly the horns had disappeared , and he was as before . " good enough ! " said the youth . and with that he put the apples in his pocket , and set out to search for the king 's daughter . he went from city to city , and sailed from country to country ; but it was a long journey , and lasted a year and a day , and even longer . but one day he got there after all . it was a sunday , and he found out that the king 's daughter was at church . then he sat himself down with his apples before the church door , and pretended to be a peddler . " apples of damascus ! apples of damascus ! " he cried . and sure enough , the king 's daughter came , and told her maidens to go and see what desirable things the peddler from abroad might have to offer . yes , he had apples of damascus . " what do the apples give one ? " asked the maiden . " wisdom and beauty ! " said the peddler , and the maiden bought .
