what did he see ? he saw a most wonderful sight . through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in , and they were sitting in the branches of the trees . in every tree that he could see there was a little child . and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms , and were waving their arms gently above the children 's heads . the birds were flying about and twittering with delight , and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing . it was a lovely scene , only in one corner it was still winter . it was the farthest corner of the garden , and in it was standing a little boy . he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree , and he was wandering all round it , crying bitterly . the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow , and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it .
