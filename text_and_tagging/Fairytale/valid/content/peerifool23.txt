but just as she was doing so the door opened once more , and a yellow - haired peerie boy entered . he was exactly like the other peerie folk who had eaten the princess 's porridge , only he was bigger , and he wore a very rich dress of grass - green velvet . he walked boldly into the middle of the kitchen and looked round him . " do you have any work for me to do ? " he asked . " i know grand how to handle wool and turn it into fine thick cloth . " " i have plenty of work for anybody who asks it , " replied the princess ; " but i have no money to pay for it , and there are but few folk in this world who will work without wages . " " all the wages that i ask is that tyou will take the trouble to find out my name , for few folk ken it , and few folk care to know . but if by any chance you can not find it out , then must you pay toll of half of your cloth . " the princess thought that it would be quite an easy thing to find out the boy 's name , so she agreed to the bargain , and , putting all the wool back into the bag , she gave it to him , and he swung it over his shoulder and departed . she ran to the door to see where he went , for she had made up her mind that she would follow him secretly to his home , and find out from the neighbours what his name was . but , to her great dismay , though she looked this way and that , he had vanished completely , and she began to wonder what she should do if the giant came back and found that she had allowed someone , whose name she did not even know , to carry off all the wool . and , as the afternoon wore on , and she could think of no way of finding out who the boy was , or where he came from , she felt that she had made a great mistake , and she began to grow very frightened .
