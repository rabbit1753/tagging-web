time passed , and every saturday seven lassies were thrown to the stoorworm , until at last it was felt that this state of things could not be allowed to go on any longer ; for if it did , there would soon be no maidens at all left in the country . so the elders met once more , and , after long consultation , it was agreed that the sorcerer should be summoned , and asked what his other remedy was . " for , by our troth , " said they , " it can not be worse than that which we are practising now . " but , had they known it , the new remedy was even more dreadful than the old . for the cruel queen hated her step - daughter , gemdelovely , and the wicked sorcerer knew that she did , and that she would not be sorry to get rid of her , and , things being as they were , he thought that he saw a way to please the queen . so he stood up in the council , and , pretending to be very sorry , said that the only other thing that could be done was to give the princess gemdelovely to the stoorworm , then would it of a surety depart .
