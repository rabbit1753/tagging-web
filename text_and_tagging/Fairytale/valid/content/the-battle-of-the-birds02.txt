the king 's son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat of each meat , and drink of each drink , warm water for his feet , and a soft bed to lie in . thus it happened the next day , and the next , but on the fourth meeting , instead of meeting the raven , in his place the king 's son found waiting for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen , with a bundle in his hand . ' is there a raven hereabouts ? ' asked the king 's son , and the youth answered : ' i am that raven , and i was delivered by thee from the spells that bound me , and in reward thou wilt get this bundle . go back by the road thou camest , and lie as before , a night in each house , but be careful not to unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most wish to dwell . ' then the king 's son set out , and thus it happened as it had happened before , till he entered a thick wood near his father 's house . he had walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier ; first he put it down under a tree , and next he thought he would look at it .
