the second knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health , for he was ashamed to tell them that love for the princess moonlight was the real cause of his leaving them . he then left his home , at the same time sending word to the princess that he was setting out for mount horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she so much wished to have . he only allowed his servants to accompany him half - way , and then sent them back . he reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship , and after sailing away for three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such a way that no one could get access to it . he then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers , and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the princess as having come from the wonderful tree growing on mount horai . every one whom he had asked declared that mount horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact . when the branch was finished , he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if he were wearied and worn out with travel . he put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and carried it to the bamboo - cutter , begging him to present it to the princess . the old man was quite deceived by the travel - stained appearance of the knight , and thought that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch . so he tried to persuade the princess to consent to see the man . but she remained silent and looked very sad . the old man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere in the whole land . then he spoke of the knight , how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken a journey to so remote a place as the mount of horai .
