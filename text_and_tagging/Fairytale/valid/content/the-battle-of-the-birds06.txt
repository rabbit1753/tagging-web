' thou art the son of the butler ! ' cried the giant . ' go home to thy mother ' ; and turning round he strode back angrily to the castle . ' bring out thy son at once , ' roared he , ' or the stone that is highest will be lowest , ' and this time the real prince was brought . but though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering all kinds of dreadful things , the giant treated him like his own son , though he never allowed him to see his daughters . the boy grew to be a big boy , and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself alone for many hours , as he had a journey to make . so the boy wandered to the top of the castle , where he had never been before . there he paused , for the sound of music broke upon his ears , and opening a door near him , he beheld a girl sitting by the window , holding a harp . ' haste and begone , i see the giant close at hand , ' she whispered hurriedly , ' but when he is asleep , return hither , for i would speak with thee . ' and the prince did as he was bid , and when midnight struck he crept back to the top of the castle . ' to - morrow , ' said the girl , who was the giant 's daughter , ' to - morrow thou wilt get the choice of my two sisters to marry , but thou must answer that thou wilt not take either , but only me . this will anger him greatly , for he wishes to betroth me to the son of the king of the green city , whom i like not at all .
