when they heard this sentence a terrible stillness fell upon the council , and everyone covered his face with his hands , for no man dare look at the king . but although his dear daughter was as the apple of his eye , he was a just and righteous monarch , and he felt that it was not right that other fathers should have been forced to part with their daughters , in order to try and save the country , if his child was to be spared . so , after he had had speech with the princess , he stood up before the elders , and declared , with trembling voice , that both he and she were ready to make the sacrifice . " she is my only child , " he said , " and the last of her race . yet it seemeth good to both of us that she should lay down her life , if by so doing she may save the land that she loves so well . "
