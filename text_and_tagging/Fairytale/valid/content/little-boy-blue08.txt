little boy blue was now very happy , and his mother was proud and contented and began to improve in health . after a few weeks she became strong enough to leave the cottage and walk a little in the fields each day ; but she could not go far , because her limbs were too feeble to support her long , so the most she could attempt was to walk as far as the stile to meet little boy blue as he came home from work in the evening . then she would lean on his shoulder and return to the cottage with him , and the boy was very glad he could thus support his darling mother and assist her faltering steps . but one day a great misfortune came upon them , since it is true that no life can be so happy but that sorrow will creep in to temper it .
