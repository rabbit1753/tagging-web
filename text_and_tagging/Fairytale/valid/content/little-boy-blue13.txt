it was very dark by this time , but little boy blue knew every turn and bend in the river , and the doctor helped him pull at the oars , so that at last they came to the place where a faint light twinkled through the cottage window . they found the poor woman in much pain , but the doctor quickly set and bandaged her leg , and gave her some medicine to ease her suffering . it was nearly midnight when all was finished and the doctor was ready to start back to the village . " take good care of your mother , " he said to the boy , " and do n't worry about her , for it is not a bad break and the leg will mend nicely in time ; but she will be in bed many days , and you must nurse her as well as you are able .
