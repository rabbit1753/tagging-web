the prince was left quite unconsolable , and declared that nothing should induce him to go back to his kingdom until he had found her again , and refusing to allow any of his courtiers to follow him , he mounted his horse and rode sadly away , letting the animal choose his own path . so it happened that he came presently to a great plain , across which he rode all day long without seeing a single house , and horse and rider were terribly hungry , when , as the night fell , the prince caught sight of a light , which seemed to shine from a cavern . he rode up to it , and saw a little old woman , who appeared to be at least a hundred years old . she put on her spectacles to look at prince hyacinth , but it was quite a long time before she could fix them securely because her nose was so very short .
