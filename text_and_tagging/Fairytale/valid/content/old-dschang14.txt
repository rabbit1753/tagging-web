quite a few of the folks at home , to whom he described his adventures , thought that old dschang must be a holy man , while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision . after five or six years sir we 's money came to an end . so his son took the straw hat to yangdschou and there asked for old wang . the latter just happened to be standing in his drug - shop , mixing herbs . when the son explained his errand he said : " the money is ready . but is your hat genuine ? " and he took the hat and examined it . a young girl came from an inner room and said : " i wove the hat for old dschang myself . there must be a red thread in it . " and sure enough , there was . then old wang gave young we the ten million pieces of copper , and the latter now believed that old dschang was really a saint . so he once more went over the hills to look for him . he asked the forest - keepers , but they could tell him naught . sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old wang , but he had also disappeared .
