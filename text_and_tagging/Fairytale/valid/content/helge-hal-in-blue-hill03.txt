there was nothing to bite or break in the hut . brother peter and brother paul had each of them gone off in a different direction . so ebe set out , too , with the cat in the lead , himself following ; but after a time he turned and went home again , to see whether the floor had been swept , and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a great rock , and there she met an enormous herd of reindeer . the cat crept softly around the herd , and then with one leap sprang between the horns of the finest buck .
