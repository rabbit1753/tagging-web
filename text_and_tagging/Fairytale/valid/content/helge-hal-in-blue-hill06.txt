the next day they both set out again , the cat in the lead , and ebe following . after a while he turned back to see whether the folding - table at home had been scoured . and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a dense forest slope . there she found an enormous herd of elk . the cat crept softly up , and suddenly there she sat between the horns of one of the stateliest of the bull elks . " if you do not go where i want you to , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat . the elk did not dare do anything save what the cat wished , and so off they went , like lightning , over stick and stone , from cliff to cliff , right past ebe , who stood before the house scouring the shutters , and with one bound into the king 's castle .
