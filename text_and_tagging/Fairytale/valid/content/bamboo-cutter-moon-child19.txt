the first knight sent word to the princess that he was starting out that day on the quest of buddha 's bowl , and he hoped soon to bring it to her . but he had not the courage to go all the way to india , for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger , so he went to one of the temples in kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there , paying the priest a large sum of money for it . he then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and , waiting quietly for three years , returned and carried it to the old man .
