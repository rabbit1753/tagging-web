the poor , distressed creature -- for it was now to be pitied , even although it was a great , cruel , awful mester stoorworm -- tossed itself to and fro , twisting and writhing . and as it tossed its awful head out of the water its tongue fell out , and struck the earth with such force that it made a great dent in it , into which the sea rushed . and that dent formed the crooked straits which now divide denmark from norway and sweden . then some of its teeth fell out and rested in the sea , and became the islands that we now call the orkney isles ; and a little afterwards some more teeth dropped out , and they became what we now call the shetland isles . after that the creature twisted itself into a great lump and died ; and this lump became the island of iceland ; and the fire which assipattle had kindled with his live peat still burns on underneath it , and that is why there are mountains which throw out fire in that chilly land .
