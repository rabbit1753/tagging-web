then many - colored clouds rose in the courtyard , and dulcet music sounded on the air . old dschang mounted a dragon , while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes . so they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction . they did not return until after sunset . old dschang and his wife then said to him : " this is an abode of the blessed . you can not remain here overlong . to - morrow we will escort you back . " on the following day , when taking leave , old dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat . " should you need money , " said he , " you can go to yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old wang 's drug - shop . there you can collect ten million pieces of copper . this hat is the order for them . " then he ordered his plow - boy to take him home again . quite a few of the folks at home , to whom he described his adventures , thought that old dschang must be a holy man , while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision . after five or six years sir we 's money came to an end . so his son took the straw hat to yangdschou and there asked for old wang . the latter just happened to be standing in his drug - shop , mixing herbs . when the son explained his errand he said : " the money is ready . but is your hat genuine ? " and he took the hat and examined it . a young girl came from an inner room and said : " i wove the hat for old dschang myself . there must be a red thread in it . " and sure enough , there was . then old wang gave young we the ten million pieces of copper , and the latter now believed that old dschang was really a saint . so he once more went over the hills to look for him . he asked the forest - keepers , but they could tell him naught . sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old wang , but he had also disappeared .
