one day the giant came back . he had been to visit his friend the cornish ogre , and had stayed with him for seven years . after the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say , for his conversation was limited , and he determined to return to his own castle . when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden . " what are you doing here ? " he cried in a very gruff voice , and the children ran away . " my own garden is my own garden , " said the giant ; " any one can understand that , and i will allow nobody to play in it but myself . " so he built a high wall all round it , and put up a notice - board .
