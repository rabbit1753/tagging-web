so she mentioned first one name and then another , always pretending to think that she had hit upon the right one ; and all the time the peerie boy jumped from side to side with delight , for he thought that she would never find out the right name , and that half of the cloth would be his . but at last the princess grew tired of joking , and she cried out , with a little laugh of triumph , " do you by any chance know anyone called peerifool , little mannikin ?

" and he hurried home in a great state of mind in case he should find that his new servant 's pretty red lips had grown long and ugly in his absence .
