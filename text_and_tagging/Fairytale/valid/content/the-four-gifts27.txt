as the days went on tephany grew paler and paler , till everybody noticed it except her aunt . the water - pot was almost too heavy for her now , but morning and evening she carried it to the spring , though the effort to lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her . ' how could i have been so foolish , ' she whispered to herself , when she went down as usual at sunset . ' it was not freedom to see denis that i should have asked for , for he was soon weary of me , nor a quick tongue , for he was afraid of it , nor beauty , for that brought me nothing but trouble , but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others . ah ! if i only dared to beg this gift from the fairy , i should be wiser than before and know how to choose better . ' ' be satisfied , ' said the voice of the old woman , who seemed to be standing unseen at tephany 's elbow . ' if you look in your right - hand pocket when you go home you will find a small box . rub your eyes with the ointment it contains , and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless treasure . ' tephany did not in the least understand what she meant , but ran back to the farm as fast as she could , and began to fumble joyfully in her right - hand pocket . sure enough , there was the little box with the precious ointment . she was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when barbaik bourhis entered the room . ever since she had been obliged to leave her work and pass her time , she did not know why , in counting cabbages , everything had gone wrong , and she could not get a labourer to stay with her because of her bad temper . when , therefore , she saw her niece standing quietly before her mirror , barbaik broke out : ' so this is what you do when i am out in the fields ! ah ! it is no wonder if the farm is ruined . are you not ashamed , girl , to behave so ? ' tephany tried to stammer some excuse , but her aunt was half mad with rage , and a box on the ears was her only answer . at this tephany , hurt , bewildered and excited , could control herself no longer , and turning away burst into tears . but what was her surprise when she saw that each tear - drop was a round and shining pearl . barbaik , who also beheld this marvel , uttered a cry of astonishment , and threw herself on her knees to pick them up from the floor . she was still gathering them when the door opened and in came denis .
