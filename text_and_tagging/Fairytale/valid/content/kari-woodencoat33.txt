when the sermon was over , and the king 's daughter left the church , the prince had poured tar on the floor of the vestibule , so that he might have a chance to help the king 's daughter across . but she paid no attention to it , stepped right into the middle of the tar , and leaped over . but one of her golden shoes stuck fast , and when she had mounted her horse , the prince came running out of the church and asked her whence she came . " from combland ! " she answered . but when the prince wanted to hand her the golden shoe , she said : " be there light before me , and darkness behind , that the place i ride to the prince may not find ! "
