at last the day came for the naming of their new - found child , so the old couple called in a celebrated name - giver , and he gave her the name of princess moonlight , because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the moon god . for three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music . all the friends and relations of the old couple were present , and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of princess moonlight . everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely ; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her , so they said . the fame of the princess 's loveliness spread far and wide , and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand , or even so much as to see her . suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house , and made little holes in the fence , in the hope of catching a glimpse of the princess as she went from one room to the other along the veranda . they stayed there day and night , sacrificing even their sleep for a chance of seeing her , but all in vain . then they approached the house , and tried to speak to the old man and his wife or some of the servants , but not even this was granted them . still , in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day , and night after night , and counted it as nothing , so great was their desire to see the princess .
