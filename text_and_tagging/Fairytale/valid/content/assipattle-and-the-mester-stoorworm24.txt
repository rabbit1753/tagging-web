assipattle was not tumbling about in the ashes now ; he was sitting up in the darkness , with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes . his opportunity had come at last , and he knew it . he waited patiently till their heavy breathing told him that his parents were asleep ; then he crept over to where his father 's clothes were , and took the goose 's windpipe out of the pocket of his coat , and slipped noiselessly out of the house . once he was out of it , he ran like lightning to the stable . he saddled and bridled go - swift , and threw a halter round her neck , and led her to the stable door . the good mare , unaccustomed to her new groom , pranced , and reared , and plunged ; but assipattle , knowing his father 's secret , clapped her once on the left shoulder , and she stood as still as a stone . then he mounted her , and gave her two claps on the right shoulder , and the good horse trotted off briskly , giving a loud neigh as she did so .
