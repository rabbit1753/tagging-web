" but old dschang did not cease to entreat her : " make an attempt , just one attempt , to mention me ! if they will not listen to you , then i must resign myself to my fate ! " the old match - maker had taken his money , so she could not well refuse , and though she feared being scolded , she mentioned him to sir we . he grew angry and wanted to throw her out of the house . " i knew you would not thank me , " said she , " but the old man urged it so that i could not refuse to mention his intention . " " tell the old man that if this very day he brings me two white jade - stones , and four hundred ounces of yellow gold , then i will give him my daughter 's hand in marriage . "
