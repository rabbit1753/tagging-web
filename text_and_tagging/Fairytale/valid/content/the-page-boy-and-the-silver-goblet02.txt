the little page - boy was very fond of going out on this moor when his work was done , for then he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees , and catching butterflies , and looking for birds ' nests when it was nesting time . and the old butler was very pleased that he should do so , for he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the open air . but before the boy went out the old man always gave him one warning . " now , mind my words , laddie , and keep far away from the fairy knowe , for the little folk are not to trust to . "
