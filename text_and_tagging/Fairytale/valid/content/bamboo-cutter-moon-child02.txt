one morning as usual he had gone out to his work , and having found a nice clump of bamboos , had set to work to cut some of them down . suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with a bright soft light , as if the full moon had risen over the spot . looking round in astonishment , he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo . the old man , full of wonder , dropped his ax and went towards the light . on nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from a hollow in the green bamboo stem , and still more wonderful to behold , in the midst of the brilliance stood a tiny human being , only three inches in height , and exquisitely beautiful in appearance .
