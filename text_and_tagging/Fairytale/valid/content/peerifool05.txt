now the princess was no coward , so , although she had not expected to face a giant , she gathered up her courage , and cried out sharply , " who gave thee liberty to cut our cabbages ? leave off this minute , and go away . " the giant paid no heed , but went on steadily with what he was doing . " do you not hear me ? " cried the girl indignantly ; for she was the princess royal , and had always been accustomed to be obeyed . " if you will be not quiet i will take you too , " said the giant grimly , pressing the cabbages down into the creel . " i should like to see you try , " retorted the princess , rising from her stool and stamping her foot ; for she felt so angry that she forgot for a moment that she was only a weak maiden and he was a great and powerful giant .
