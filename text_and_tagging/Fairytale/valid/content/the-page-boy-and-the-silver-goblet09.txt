he placed it in the middle of the table , and , amid clapping of hands and shouts of joy , all the fairies began to drink out of it in turn . and the page could see , from where he stood , that no one poured wine into it , and yet it was always full , and that the wine that was in it was not always the same kind , but that each fairy , when he grasped its stem , wished for the wine that he loved best , and lo ! in a moment the cup was full of it . " twould be a fine thing if i could take that cup home with me , " thought the page . " no one will believe that i have been here except i have something to show for it . " so he bided his time , and watched . he raised the cup to his lips , but he did not drink from it . with a sudden jerk he threw the water over the candles , and instantly the room was in darkness . then , clasping the precious cup tightly in his arms , he sprang to the opening of the knowe , through which he could see the stars glimmering clearly . he was just in time , for it fell to with a crash behind him ; and soon he was speeding along the wet , dew - spangled moor , with the whole troop of fairies at his heels . they were wild with rage , and from the shrill shouts of fury which they uttered , the page knew well that , if they overtook him , he need expect no mercy at their hands . and his heart began to sink , for , fleet of foot though he was , he was no match for the fairy folk , who gained on him steadily .
