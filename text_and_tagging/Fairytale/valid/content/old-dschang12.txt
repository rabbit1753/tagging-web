after a short time a maid - servant came and led him to the inner rooms , to his sister . the beams of her room were of sandalwood , the doors of tortoise - shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade ; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite . his sister was magnificently gowned , and far more beautiful than before . she asked him carelessly how he was getting along , and what her parents were doing ; but was not very cordial . after a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him . " my sister wishes to make an excursion to the mountain of the fairies , " said old dschang to him . " we will be back about sunset , and you can rest until we return . " then many - colored clouds rose in the courtyard , and dulcet music sounded on the air . old dschang mounted a dragon , while his wife and sister rode on phenixes and their attendants on cranes . so they rose into the air and disappeared in an easterly direction . they did not return until after sunset . old dschang and his wife then said to him : " this is an abode of the blessed . you can not remain here overlong . to - morrow we will escort you back . " on the following day , when taking leave , old dschang gave him eighty ounces of gold and an old straw hat . " should you need money , " said he , " you can go to yangdschou and inquire in the northern suburb for old wang 's drug - shop . there you can collect ten million pieces of copper . this hat is the order for them . " then he ordered his plow - boy to take him home again .
