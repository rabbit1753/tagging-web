at last they set out again ; but the bull was still weak , and at first they went slowly . the king 's daughter wanted to spare him , and said she was young and quick on her feet , and could walk very well ; but this he would not allow , and she had to sit on his back . thus they wandered for a long time , and through many lands , and the king 's daughter had no idea where they might be going ; but at length they came to a golden forest . it was very beautiful , and the gold dripped down from it , for the trees , and branches and leaves and buds were all of purest gold . and here all went as it had in the copper and silver forests .
