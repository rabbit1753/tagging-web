on a night in mid - autumn , an emperor of the tang dynasty once sat at wine with two sorcerers . and one of them took his bamboo staff and cast it into the air , where it turned into a heavenly bridge , on which the three climbed up to the moon together . there they saw a great castle on which was inscribed : " the spreading halls of crystal cold . " beside it stood a cassia tree which blossomed and gave forth a fragrance filling all the air . and in the tree sat a man who was chopping off the smaller boughs with an ax . one of the sorcerers said : " that is the man in the moon . the cassia tree grows so luxuriantly that in the course of time it would overshadow all the moon 's radiance . therefore it has to be cut down once in every thousand years . " then they entered the spreading halls . the silver stories of the castle towered one above the other , and its walls and columns were all formed of liquid crystal . in the walls were cages and ponds , where fishes and birds moved as though alive . the whole moon - world seemed made of glass . while they were still looking about them on all sides the lady of the moon stepped up to them , clad in a white mantle and a rainbow - colored gown .
