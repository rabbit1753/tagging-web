never had the old man enjoyed himself so much . the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot , with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him . but the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think about taking his leave and return home . he thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment , and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife . he told the lady sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing . it was his anxiety to know how she fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her . now he knew that all was well he could return home with a light heart . if ever she wanted him for anything she had only to send for him and he would come at once .
