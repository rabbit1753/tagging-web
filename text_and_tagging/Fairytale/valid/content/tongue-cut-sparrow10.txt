the old woman pretended not to know at first , and answered : " your sparrow ? i am sure i do n't know . now i come to think of it , i have n't seen her all the afternoon . i should n't wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all your petting ! " but at last , when the old man gave her no peace , but asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet , she confessed all . she told him crossly how the sparrow had eaten the rice - paste she had specially made for starching her clothes , and how when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done , in great anger she had taken her scissors and cut out her tongue , and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return to the house again .
