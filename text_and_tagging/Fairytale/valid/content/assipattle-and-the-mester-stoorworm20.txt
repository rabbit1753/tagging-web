when the king 's proclamation was made known throughout the neighbouring kingdoms , there was a fine stir among all the young gallants , for it seemed but a little thing to slay a sea - monster ; and a beautiful wife , a fertile kingdom , and a trusty sword are not to be won every day . so six - and - thirty champions arrived at the king 's palace , each hoping to gain the prize . but the king sent them all out to look at the giant stoorworm lying in the sea with its enormous mouth open , and when they saw it , twelve of them were seized with sudden illness , and twelve of them were so afraid that they took to their heels and ran , and never stopped till they reached their own countries ; and so only twelve returned to the king 's palace , and as for them , they were so downcast at the thought of the task that they had undertaken that they had no spirit left in them at all . and none of them dare try to kill the stoorworm ; so the three weeks passed slowly by , until the night before the day on which the princess was to be sacrificed . on that night the king , feeling that he must do something to entertain his guests , made a great supper for them . but , as you may think , it was a dreary feast , for everyone was thinking so much about the terrible thing that was to happen on the morrow , that no one could eat or drink . and when it was all over , and everybody had retired to rest , save the king and his old kemperman , the king returned to the great hall , and went slowly up to his chair of state , high up on the dais . it was not like the chairs of state that we know nowadays ; it was nothing but a massive kist , in which he kept all the things which he treasured most . the old monarch undid the iron bolts with trembling fingers , and lifted the lid , and took out the wondrous sword sickersnapper , which had belonged to the great god odin . his trusty kemperman , who had stood by him in a hundred fights , watched him with pitying eyes . " why lift ye out the sword , " he said softly , " when thy fighting days are done ? right nobly hast thou fought thy battles in the past , oh , my lord ! when thine arm was strong and sure . but when folk 's years number four score and sixteen , as thine do , it is time to leave such work to other and younger men . " the old king turned on him angrily , with something of the old fire in his eyes . " wheest , " he cried , " else will i turn this sword on thee . dost thou think that i can see my only bairn devoured by a monster , and not lift a finger to try and save her when no other man will ? i tell thee -- and i will swear it with my two thumbs crossed on sickersnapper -- that both the sword and i will be destroyed before so much as one of her hairs be touched . so go , and thou love me , my old comrade , and order my boat to be ready , with the sail set and the prow pointed out to sea . i will go myself and fight the stoorworm ; and if i do not return , i will lay it on thee to guard my cherished daughter . peradventure , my life may redeem hers .
