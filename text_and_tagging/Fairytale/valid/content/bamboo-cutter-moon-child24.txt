just at this moment the six jewelers , who had been employed on the making of the branch , but not yet paid by the knight , arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the princess to be paid for their labor . they said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the branch of gold , with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit , that was now presented to her by the knight , but as yet they had received nothing in payment . so this knight 's deception was thus found out , and the princess , glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor , was only too pleased to send back the branch . she called in the workmen and had them paid liberally , and they went away happy . but on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man , who beat them till they were nearly dead , for letting out the secret , and they barely escaped with their lives . the knight then returned home , raging in his heart ; and in despair of ever winning the princess gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains .
