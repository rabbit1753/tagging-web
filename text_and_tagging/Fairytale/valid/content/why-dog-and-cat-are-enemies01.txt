once upon a time there was a man and his wife and they had a ring of gold . it was a lucky ring , and whoever owned it always had enough to live on . but this they did not know , and hence sold the ring for a small sum . but no sooner was the ring gone than they began to grow poorer and poorer , and at last did not know when they would get their next meal . they had a dog and a cat , and these had to go hungry as well . then the two animals took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune . at length the dog hit upon an idea .
