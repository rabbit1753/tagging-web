little boy blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked , for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage . but when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight , and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears . little boy blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother , her face white and drawn with suffering , and tears of anguish running down her cheeks . for she had slipped upon the stile and fallen , and her leg was broken ! little boy blue ran to the cottage for water and bathed the poor woman 's face , and raised her head that she might drink . there were no neighbors , for the cottage stood all alone by the river , so the child was obliged to support his mother in his arms as best he could while she crawled painfully back to the cottage . fortunately , it was not far , and at last she was safely laid upon her bed . then little boy blue began to think what he should do next . " can i leave you alone while i go for the doctor , mamma ? " he asked , anxiously , as he held her clasped hands tightly in his two little ones . his mother drew him towards her and kissed him .
