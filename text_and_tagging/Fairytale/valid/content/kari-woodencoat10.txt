in the meantime the bull trotted through many lands with the king 's daughter , and they came to a great copper forest , whose trees , leaves and flowers were all of copper . but before they entered it , the bull said to the king 's daughter : " now when we get into the forest you must be very careful not to touch so much as a single leaf , or else it is all up with you and with me ; for a troll with three heads lives here , and the forest belongs to him . " yes , indeed , she would be careful , and not touch anything . and she was very careful , and leaned to one side , and thrust aside the branches ; but the forest was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through , and for all that she was so careful , she did tear off a leaf , and it remained in her hand . " alas , alas ! " cried the bull . " what have you done ! now i must fight for my very life . but see that you keep the leaf carefully ! " straightway they reached the end of the forest , and at once a troll with three heads came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " was the bull 's reply . " we 'll see if it is ! " shouted the troll . " that suits me ! " cried the bull . then they rushed at each other , and the bull gored and butted with might and main . but the troll was just as strong , and it took all day before the bull gained the upper hand . and then he had so many wounds , and was so weak that he could scarcely walk . so they had to halt for a whole day ; but the bull told the queen 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . thereupon he grew strong and well again , and they went on the next day . now they wandered for many , many days , and at last came to a silver forest , whose trees , branches , leaves , buds and all were of silver .
