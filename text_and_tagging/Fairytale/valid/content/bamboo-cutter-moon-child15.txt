" i found you , " answered the old man , " many years ago , when you were a little creature three inches high , in the midst of a great white light . the light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you . so i have always thought that you were more than mortal woman . while i am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so , but some day i shall cease to be and who will take care of you then ? therefore i pray you to meet these five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them ! " then the princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be , and that even if she consented to marry any one of them , not really knowing her before , his heart might change afterwards . so as she did not feel sure of them , even though her father told her they were worthy knights , she did not feel it wise to see them . " all you say is very reasonable , " said the old man , " but what kind of men will you consent to see ? i do not call these five men who have waited on you for months , light - hearted . they have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer , often denying themselves food and sleep so that they may win you . what more can you demand ? " then princess moonlight said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant their request to interview her . the five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing her from distant countries something that she desired to possess .
