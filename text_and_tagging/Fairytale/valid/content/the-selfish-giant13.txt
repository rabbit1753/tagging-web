" climb up ! little boy , " said the tree , and it bent its branches down as low as it could ; but the boy was too tiny . and the giant 's heart melted as he looked out . " how selfish i have been ! " he said ; " now i know why the spring would not come here . i will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree , and then i will knock down the wall , and my garden shall be the children 's playground for ever and ever . " he was really very sorry for what he had done . so he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly , and went out into the garden . but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away , and the garden became winter again . only the little boy did not run , for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming . and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand , and put him up into the tree .
