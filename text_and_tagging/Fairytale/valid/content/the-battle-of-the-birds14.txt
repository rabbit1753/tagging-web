' my daughter 's tricks are the hardest things that ever met me , ' said the giant , ' but if i had my lever and my crowbar , i would not be long in making my way through this rock also , ' but as he had got them , he had to go home and fetch them . then it took him but a short time to hew his way through the rock . ' i will leave the tools here , ' he murmured aloud when he had finished . ' if thou leavest them , we will steal them , ' said a hoodie who was perched on a stone above him , and the giant answered : ' steal them if thou wilt ; there is no time to go back . ' ' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl ; ' look in the mare 's ear , king 's son , or we are lost , ' and he looked , and found a tiny bladder full of water , which he threw behind him , and it became a great lock . and the giant , who was striding on so fast , could not stop himself , and he walked right into the middle and was drowned .
