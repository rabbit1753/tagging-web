and one day , not long after they had been married , his wife said to him : " to - morrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday , and you must go to congratulate her . they will offer you tea and food . the tea you may drink , but be sure not to touch any of the food . keep this in mind ! " so the following day the wife and husband went to her mother 's home and offered their congratulations . her parents seemed highly pleased , and served them with tea and sweets . the son - in - law drank , but ate nothing , though his wife 's parents , with kind words and friendly gestures , kept urging him to help himself . at last the son - in - law did not know what to do , and thought that surely they could mean him no ill . and seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him , he ate a little of them . his wife gave him a reproachful glance , and he offered some excuse for taking his leave .
