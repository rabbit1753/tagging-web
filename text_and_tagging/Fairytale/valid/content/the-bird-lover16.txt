she had come to a bank , painted with flowers of every hue , and was reclining on its fragrant couch , when a bird , of red and deep - blue plumage softly blended , alighted on a branch near by , and began to pour forth its carol . it was a bird of strange character , such as she had never before seen . its first note was so delicious to the ear of minda , and it so pierced to her young heart , that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound . it seemed like the human voice , forbidden to speak , and uttering its language through this wild wood - chant with a mournful melody , as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible . the voice of the bird rose and fell , and circled round and round , but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes , they seemed ever to have their center where minda sat ; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird , that sat in his red and deep - blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank . the poor bird strove more and more with his voice , and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to minda 's ear , till at last she could not refrain from saying , " what aileth thee , sad bird ? " as if he had but waited to be spoken to , the bird left his branch , and alighting upon the bank , smiled on minda , and , shaking his shining plumage , answered : " i am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage . i have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the indian girls , but none ever heeded my voice till you . will you be mine ? " he added , and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene , and fairly entranced the young minda , who sat silent , as if she feared to break the charm by speech . the bird , approaching nearer , asked her , if she loved him , to get her mother 's consent to their marriage . " i shall be free then , " said the bird , " and you shall know me as i am . " minda lingered , and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes , or filling each pause with gentle human discourse ; questioning her as to her home , her family , and the little incidents of her daily life . she returned to the lodge later than usual , but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her . she returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood ; and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure , and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage . this she could not , however , muster heart and courage to do . the widow 's family left the scene , and when they had all come out into the open fields , they walked on together until they had reached the fragrant bank and the evergreen wood , where the daughter had first encountered her bird lover . monedowa turning to her , said : " my mother , here we must part . your daughter and myself must now leave you . the good spirit , moved with pity , has allowed me to be your friend . i have done that for which i was sent . i am permitted to take with me the one whom i love . i have found your daughter ever kind , gentle and just . she shall be my companion . the blessing of the good spirit be ever with you . farewell , my mother - my brother , farewell . " while the widow woman was still lost in wonder at these words , monedowa , and minda his wife , changed at the same moment , rose into the air , as beautiful birds , clothed in shining colors of red and blue .
