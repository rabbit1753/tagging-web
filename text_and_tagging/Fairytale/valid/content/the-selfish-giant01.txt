every afternoon , as they were coming from school , the children used to go and play in the giant 's garden . it was a large lovely garden , with soft green grass . here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars , and there were twelve peach - trees that in the spring - time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl , and in the autumn bore rich fruit . the birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them . " how happy we are here ! " they cried to each other .
