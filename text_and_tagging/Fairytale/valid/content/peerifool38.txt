in the afternoon the clever little maiden went through the house , gathering together all the lace , and silver , and jewellery that she could find , and brought them and placed them beside the creel . then she went out and cut an armful of grass , and brought it in and laid it beside them . then she crept into the creel herself , and pulled all the fine things in above her , and then she covered everything up with the grass , which was a very difficult thing to do , seeing she herself was at the bottom of the basket . then she lay quite still and waited . presently the giant came in , and , obedient to his promise , he lifted the creel and carried it off to the old queen 's cottage . no one seemed to be at home , so he set it down in the entry , and turned to go away . but the little princess had told her sisters what to do , and they had a great can of boiling water ready in one of the rooms upstairs , and when they heard his steps coming round that side of the house , they threw open the window and emptied it all over his head ; and that was the end of him .
