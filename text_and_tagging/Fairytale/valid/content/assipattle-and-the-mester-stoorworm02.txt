and his brothers , working hard in the fields , would point to him with mocking fingers , and laugh , and say to each other how well the name suited him , and of how little use he was in the world . and when they came home from their work , they would push him about and tease him , and even his mother would make him sweep the floor , and draw water from the well , and fetch peats from the peat - stack , and do all the little odd jobs that nobody else would do . so poor assipattle had rather a hard life of it , and he would often have been very miserable had it not been for his sister , who loved him dearly , and who would listen quite patiently to all the stories that he had to tell ; who never laughed at him or told him that he was telling lies , as his brothers did .
