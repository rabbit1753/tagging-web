all that day she sat on a well which was near the gate , waiting , waiting , but the king 's son never came . in the darkness she climbed up into an oak tree that shadowed the well , and there she lay all night , waiting , waiting . on the morrow , at midday , the wife of a shoemaker who dwelt near the well went to draw water for her husband to drink , and she saw the shadow of the girl in the tree , and thought it was her own shadow . ' how handsome i am , to be sure , ' said she , gazing into the well , and as she stopped to behold herself better , the jug struck against the stones and broke in pieces , and she was forced to return to her husband without the water , and this angered him . ' thou hast turned crazy , ' said he in wrath . ' go thou , my daughter , and fetch me a drink , ' and the girl went , and the same thing befell her as had befallen her mother . ' where is the water ? ' asked the shoemaker , when she came back , and as she held nothing save the handle of the jug he went to the well himself . he too saw the reflection of the woman in the tree , but looked up to discover whence it came , and there above him sat the most beautiful woman in the world . ' come down , ' he said , ' for a while thou canst stay in my house , ' and glad enough the girl was to come .
