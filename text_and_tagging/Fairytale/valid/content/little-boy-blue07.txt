the poor widow wept tears of joy when she heard his story , and smiled when he told her that his name was to be little boy blue . she knew the squire was a kind master and would be good to her darling son . early the next morning little boy blue was at the hall , and the squire 's steward gave him a new silver horn , that glistened brightly in the sunshine , and a golden cord to fasten it around his neck . and then he was given charge of the sheep and the cows , and told to keep them from straying into the meadowlands and the fields of grain . it was not hard work , but just suited to little boy blue 's age , and he was watchful and vigilant and made a very good shepherd boy indeed . his mother needed food no longer , for the squire paid her son liberally and the squire 's daughter made a favorite of the small shepherd and loved to hear the call of his silver horn echoing amongst the hills . even the sheep and the cows were fond of him , and always obeyed the sound of his horn ; therefore the squire 's corn thrived finely , and was never trampled .
