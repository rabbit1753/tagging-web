at last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully , expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth . what she saw , however , so terrified her that she nearly lost her senses . as soon as she lifted the lid , a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her . not even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much - coveted box contained . a demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her , monsters with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her , a huge snake coiled and hissed about her , and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her . the old woman had never been so frightened in her life , and ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her , glad to escape alive . when she reached home she fell to the floor and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her , and how she had been nearly killed by the demons in the box .
