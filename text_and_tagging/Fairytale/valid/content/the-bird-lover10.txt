monedowa partook of it first , to show his guest that he need not fear , saying at the same time , " it is a feast , and as we seldom meet , we must eat all that is placed on the dish , as a mark of gratitude to the great spirit for permitting me to kill animals , and for the pleasure of seeing you , and partaking of it with you . " they ate and talked , on this and that , until they had nearly dispatched the meal , when the manito took up the dish and drank off the broth at a breath . on setting it down he immediately turned his head and commenced coughing with great violence . the old body in which he had disguised himself was well - nigh shaken in pieces , for he had , as monedowa expected , swallowed a grain of the birch - bud , and this , which relished to himself as being of the bird nature , greatly distressed the old manito , who partook of the character of an animal , or four - footed thing . he was at last put to such confusion of face by his constant coughing , that he was enforced to leave , saying , or rather hiccoughing as he left the lodge , that he should look for the young man at the racing - ground in the morning . when the morning came , monedowa was early astir , oiling his limbs and enameling his breast and arms with red and blue , resembling the plumage in which he had first appeared to minda . upon his brow he placed a tuft of feathers of the same shining tints .
