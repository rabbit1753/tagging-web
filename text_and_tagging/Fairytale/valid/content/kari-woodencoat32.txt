then everything happened exactly as on the other two occasions . she went to the wall of rock , and knocked with the stick , and then the man came out , and gave her a dress that was far more beautiful than both of the others . it was all pure gold and diamonds , and she also received a beautiful horse , with housings embroidered with gold , and a golden bridle . when the king 's daughter came to the church , the pastor and all the congregation were still standing before the church door , waiting for her . the prince came running up at once , and wanted to hold her horse , but she jumped down and said : " no , thanks , it is not necessary , for my horse is so tame that he will remain standing when i tell him to do so . " so they all went into the church , and the pastor mounted the pulpit . but not a soul listened to the sermon , because all the people were looking at the princess , and wondering where she came from , and the prince fell still more deeply in love than he had on the two other occasions . he paid no attention to anything , and looked only at her .
