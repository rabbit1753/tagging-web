at her words the peerie folk shouted with laughter , till their straw - coloured hair tumbled right over their faces ; then they hopped on to the floor and ran out of the house , and presently they came trooping back holding cups of blue - bells , and foxgloves , and saucers of primroses and anemones in their hands ; and the princess put a tiny spoonful of porridge into each saucer , and a tiny drop of milk into each cup , and they ate it all up as daintily as possible with neat little grass spoons , which they had brought with them in their pockets . when they had finished they all cried out , " thank you ! thank you ! " and ran out of the kitchen again , leaving the princess alone . and , being alone , she went all over the house to look for her sisters , but , of course , she could not find them . " never mind , i will find them soon , " she said to herself . " to - morrow i will search the byre and the outhouses ; in the meantime , i had better get on with my work . " so she went back to the kitchen , and took out the bag of wool , which the giant had told her to make into cloth .
