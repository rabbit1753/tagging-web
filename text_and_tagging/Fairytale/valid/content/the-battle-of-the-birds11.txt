so he went and gave the eggs to the giant , who nodded his head . ' make ready for thy marriage , ' cried he , ' for the wedding shall take place this very night , and i will summon thy bride to greet thee . ' then his three daughters were sent for , and they all entered dressed in green silk of the same fashion , and with golden circlets round their heads . the king 's son looked from one to another . which was the youngest ? suddenly his eyes fell on the hand of the middle one , and there was no little finger . ' thou hast aimed well this time too , ' said the giant , as the king 's son laid his hand on her shoulder , ' but perhaps we may meet some other way ' ; and though he pretended to laugh , the bride saw a gleam in his eye which warned her of danger . the wedding took place that very night , and the hall was filled with giants and gentlemen , and they danced till the house shook from top to bottom . at last everyone grew tired , and the guests went away , and the king 's son and his bride were left alone .
