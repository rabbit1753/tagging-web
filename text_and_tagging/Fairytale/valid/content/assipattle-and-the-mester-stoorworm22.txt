his trusty kemperman , who had stood by him in a hundred fights , watched him with pitying eyes . " why lift ye out the sword , " he said softly , " when thy fighting days are done ? right nobly hast thou fought thy battles in the past , oh , my lord ! when thine arm was strong and sure . but when folk 's years number four score and sixteen , as thine do , it is time to leave such work to other and younger men . " the old king turned on him angrily , with something of the old fire in his eyes . " wheest , " he cried , " else will i turn this sword on thee . dost thou think that i can see my only bairn devoured by a monster , and not lift a finger to try and save her when no other man will ? i tell thee -- and i will swear it with my two thumbs crossed on sickersnapper -- that both the sword and i will be destroyed before so much as one of her hairs be touched . so go , and thou love me , my old comrade , and order my boat to be ready , with the sail set and the prow pointed out to sea . i will go myself and fight the stoorworm ; and if i do not return , i will lay it on thee to guard my cherished daughter . peradventure , my life may redeem hers .
