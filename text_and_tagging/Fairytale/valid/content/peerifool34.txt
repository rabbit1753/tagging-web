" i will be avenged on him for his cruelty , " said the little princess firmly ; and when she spoke like that her sisters knew that she meant what she said . so next morning , before the giant was up , she fetched his creel , and put her eldest sister into it , and covered her with all the fine silken hangings and tapestry that she could find , and on the top of all she put a handful of grass , and when the giant came downstairs she asked him , in her sweetest tone , if he would do her a favour . and the giant , who was very pleased with her because of the quantity of cloth which he thought she had spun , said that he would . " then carry that creelful of grass home to my mother 's cottage for her cow to eat , " said the princess . " this will help to make up for all the cabbages which you have stolen from her kailyard . " and , wonderful to relate , the giant did as he was bid , and carried the creel to the cottage . next morning she put her second sister into another creel , and covered her with all the fine napery she could find in the house , and put an armful of grass on the top of it , and at her bidding the giant , who was really getting very fond of her , carried it also home to her mother . the next morning the little princess told him that she thought that she would go for a long walk after she had done her housework , and that she might not be in when he came home at night , but that she would have another creel of grass ready for him , if he would carry it to the cottage as he had done on the two previous evenings . he promised to do so ; then , as usual , he went out for the day . in the afternoon the clever little maiden went through the house , gathering together all the lace , and silver , and jewellery that she could find , and brought them and placed them beside the creel . then she went out and cut an armful of grass , and brought it in and laid it beside them . then she crept into the creel herself , and pulled all the fine things in above her , and then she covered everything up with the grass , which was a very difficult thing to do , seeing she herself was at the bottom of the basket . then she lay quite still and waited . presently the giant came in , and , obedient to his promise , he lifted the creel and carried it off to the old queen 's cottage . no one seemed to be at home , so he set it down in the entry , and turned to go away . but the little princess had told her sisters what to do , and they had a great can of boiling water ready in one of the rooms upstairs , and when they heard his steps coming round that side of the house , they threw open the window and emptied it all over his head ; and that was the end of him .
