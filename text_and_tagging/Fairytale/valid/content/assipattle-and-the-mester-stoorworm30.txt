" art thou not well - nigh frozen sitting there ? if thou wilt come on shore , and run about , and warm thyself , i will get into the boat and guard it till thou returnest . " " a likely story , " replied the man . " and what would the king say if he were to come , as i expect every moment he will do , and find me playing myself on the sand , and his good boat left to a smatchet like thee ? twould be as much as my head is worth . " " as thou wilt , " answered assipattle carelessly , beginning to search among the rocks . " in the meantime , i must be looking for a wheen mussels to roast for my breakfast . " and after he had gathered the mussels , he began to make a hole in the sand to put the live peat in . the boatman watched him curiously , for he , too , was beginning to feel hungry . presently the lad gave a wild shriek , and jumped high in the air . " gold , gold ! " he cried . " by the name of thor , who would have looked to find gold here ? "
