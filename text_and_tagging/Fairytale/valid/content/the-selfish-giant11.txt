one day the giant came back . he had been to visit his friend the cornish ogre , and had stayed with him for seven years . after the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say , for his conversation was limited , and he determined to return to his own castle . when he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden . " what are you doing here ? " he cried in a very gruff voice , and the children ran away . " my own garden is my own garden , " said the giant ; " any one can understand that , and i will allow nobody to play in it but myself . " so he built a high wall all round it , and put up a notice - board . he was a very selfish giant . the poor children had now nowhere to play . they tried to play on the road , but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones , and they did not like it . they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over , and talk about the beautiful garden inside . " how happy we were there , " they said to each other . then the spring came , and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds . only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter . the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children , and the trees forgot to blossom . once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass , but when it saw the notice - board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again , and went off to sleep . the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost .
