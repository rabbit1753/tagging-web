" though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat . " if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . " the prince made him a splendid present as a reward for this good news , and at once sent ambassadors to ask the dear little princess in marriage . the king , her father , gave his consent ; and prince hyacinth , who , in his anxiety to see the princess , had gone three leagues to meet her was just advancing to kiss her hand when , to the horror of all who stood by , the enchanter appeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning , and , snatching up the dear little princess , whirled her away out of their sight !
