at the end of that time the wedding was celebrated , and the couple were given a little house for a home . but no sooner had they entered it than the wife warned her husband to be on his guard , since her parents did not like him , and would seek to do him harm . in accordance with the custom she entered the house first with a lighted lantern , but when the bridegroom followed her she had disappeared . and thus it went , day by day . during the daytime she was there , but when evening came she disappeared . and one day , not long after they had been married , his wife said to him : " to - morrow morning my mother celebrates her birthday , and you must go to congratulate her . they will offer you tea and food . the tea you may drink , but be sure not to touch any of the food . keep this in mind ! " so the following day the wife and husband went to her mother 's home and offered their congratulations . her parents seemed highly pleased , and served them with tea and sweets . the son - in - law drank , but ate nothing , though his wife 's parents , with kind words and friendly gestures , kept urging him to help himself . at last the son - in - law did not know what to do , and thought that surely they could mean him no ill . and seeing the fresh caught eels and crabs on the plate before him , he ate a little of them . his wife gave him a reproachful glance , and he offered some excuse for taking his leave .
