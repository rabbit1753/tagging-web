' you would like to sit down and rest , granny ? ' asked tephany , pushing aside her bundle . ' when the sky is all the roof you have , you rest where you will , ' replied the old woman in trembling tones . ' are you so lonely , then ? ' inquired tephany , full of pity . ' have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses ? ' the old woman shook her head . ' they all died long , long ago , ' she answered , ' and the only friends i have are strangers with kind hearts . ' the girl did not speak for a moment , then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner .
