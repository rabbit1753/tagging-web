in the old land of brittany , once called cornwall , there lived a woman named barbaik bourhis , who spent all her days in looking after her farm with the help of her niece tephany . early and late the two might be seen in the fields or in the dairy , milking cows , making butter , feeding fowls ; working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too . perhaps it might have been better for barbaik if she had left herself a little time to rest and to think about other things , for soon she grew to love money for its own sake , and only gave herself and tephany the food and clothes they absolutely needed . and as for poor people she positively hated them , and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world .
