from this time on , the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed them down and cut them up ; not only gold , but precious stones also , so that by degrees he became rich . he built himself a fine house , and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter , but as a wealthy man . three months passed quickly away , and in that time the bamboo child had , wonderful to say , become a full - grown girl , so her foster - parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful kimonos . she was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess , and allowed no one to see her , waiting upon her themselves . it seemed as if she were made of light , for the house was filled with a soft shining , so that even in the dark of night it was like daytime . her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there . whenever the old man felt sad , he had only to look upon his foster - daughter and his sorrow vanished , and he became as happy as when he was a youth .
