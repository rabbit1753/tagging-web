once upon a time there was a lad who was better off than all the others . he was never short of money , for he had a purse which was never empty . he never was short of food , for he had a table - cloth on which , as soon as he spread it , he found all he wanted to eat and drink . and , besides , he had a magic wishing cap . when he put it on he could wish himself wherever he wanted , and there he would be that very moment . there was only one thing that he lacked : he had no wife , and he was gradually coming into the years when it would be necessary for him to make haste . as he was walking sadly along one fine day , it occurred to him to wish himself where he would find the most beautiful princess in the world . no sooner had he thought of it than he was there . and it was a land which he had never yet seen , and a city in which he had never yet been . and the king had a daughter , so handsome that he had never yet beheld her like , and he wanted to have her on the spot . but she would have nothing to do with him , and was very haughty .
