" and they both sat down before the box and opened it . to their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins and many other precious things . the mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again . the old man was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his . beyond his brightest expectations was the sparrow 's gift , which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
