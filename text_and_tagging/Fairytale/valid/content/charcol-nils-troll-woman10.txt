the charcoal - burner did as the old man told him , saddled his horse , paying strict attention that there were no loops in saddle or bridle , rode across the ice through the wood to his kiln , and told the troll - woman and her children to get in . then he quickly turned back through the wood , out on the ice , and there let his horse run as fast as he could . when he reached the middle of the lake , he saw a pack of wolves running along in the direction of aboda - land , at the northern end of the lake , and heading for the ice . then he tore the saddle - harness from the traces , so that the wagon with the troll - folk was left standing on the bare ice , and rode as fast as his horse could carry him for the opposite shore . when the trolls saw the wolves they began to scream .
