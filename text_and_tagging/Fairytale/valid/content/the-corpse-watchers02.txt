about a week after , the second daughter went to seek her fortune , and she did n't care for her mother 's blessing no more nor her sister , and the very same thing happened to her . she was left a grey flag by the side of the other . at last the youngest went off in search of the other two , and she took care to carry her mother 's blessing with her . she shared her dinner with the poor woman on the road , and she told her that she would watch over her . well , she got lodging in the same place as the others , and agreed to mind the corpse . she sat up by the fire , with the dog and cat , and amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her . she thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse , he was so handsome .
