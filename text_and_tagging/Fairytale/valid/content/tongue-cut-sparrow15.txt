the sparrow asked him to follow her , and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove . the old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house to find what a beautiful place it was . it was built of the whitest wood , the soft cream - colored mats which took the place of carpets were the finest he had ever seen , and the cushions that the sparrow brought out for him to sit on were made of the finest silk and crape . beautiful vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma of every room .
