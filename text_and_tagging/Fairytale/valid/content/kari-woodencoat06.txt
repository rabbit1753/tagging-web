now the king came home , and he had defeated the other king , against whom he had warred ; and the whole castle was overjoyed , and none was more joyful than the king 's daughter . but the queen pretended to be ill , and gave the physician a great deal of money so that he should say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat . the king 's daughter and others as well asked the physician whether nothing else would do , and pleaded for the bull ; for all liked him , and said that there was not such another in the whole kingdom . but no , he must be slaughtered , and he should be slaughtered , and there was no help for it . when the king 's daughter heard this , she felt sad , and went into the stable to the bull . he stood and hung his head , and looked so mournful that she could not keep from weeping . " why do you weep ? " asked the bull . then she told him that the king had come home , and that the queen had pretended to be ill , and had forced the physician to say that she could not recover unless she had some of the blue bull 's flesh to eat , and that now he was to be slaughtered . " once she has done away with me , it will not be long before she does away with you , " said the bull . " but if it suits you , we will run away from here to - night . " the king 's daughter did say that it would be bad enough to leave her father , but that at the same time it would be worse to remain under the same roof with the queen , and so she promised the bull to go with him .
