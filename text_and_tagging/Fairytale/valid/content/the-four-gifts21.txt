the carriage was large and barred the narrow road , so tephany was forced , much against her will , to remain where she was . but she looked the young man full in the face as she answered : ' go your way , noble lord , and let me go mine . i am only a poor peasant girl , accustomed to milk , and make hay and spin . ' ' peasant you may be , but i will make you a great lady , ' said he , taking her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage . ' i do n't want to be a great lady , i only want to be the wife of denis , ' she replied , throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided the road from the cornfield , where he hoped to hide . unluckily the young man guessed what she was doing , and signed to his attendants , who seized her and put her in the coach . the door was banged , and the horses whipped up into a gallop .
