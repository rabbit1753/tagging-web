however , it was no use standing there staring at the fir , at least he must try to do his best , and try he did till his hands and knees were sore , for as soon as he had struggled up a few feet , he slid back again . once he climbed a little higher than before , and hope rose in his heart , then down he came with such force that his hands and knees smarted worse than ever . ' this is no time for stopping , ' said the voice of the giant 's daughter , as he leant against the trunk to recover his breath . ' alas ! i am no sooner up than down , ' answered he . ' try once more , ' said she , and she laid a finger against the tree and bade him put his foot on it . then she placed another finger a little higher up , and so on till he reached the top , where the magpie had built her nest . ' make haste now with the nest , ' she cried , ' for my father 's breath is burning my back , ' and down he scrambled as fast as he could , but the girl 's little finger had caught in a branch at the top , and she was obliged to leave it there . but she was too busy to pay heed to this , for the sun was getting high over the hills . ' listen to me , ' she said . ' this night my two sisters and i will be dressed in the same garments , and you will not know me . but when my father says ' go to thy wife , king 's son , ' come to the one whose right hand has no little finger .
