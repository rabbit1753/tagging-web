the sparrow led the old man to the place of honor , and then , taking her place at a humble distance , she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years . then the lady sparrow , as we will now call her , introduced all her family to the old man . this done , her daughters , robed in dainty crape gowns , brought in on beautiful old - fashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious foods , till the old man began to think he must be dreaming . in the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow 's daughters performed a wonderful dance , called the " suzume - odori " or the " sparrow 's dance , " to amuse the guest .
