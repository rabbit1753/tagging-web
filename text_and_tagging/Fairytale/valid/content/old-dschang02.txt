once upon a time there was a man who went by the name of old dschang . he lived in the country , near yangdschou , as a gardener . his neighbor , named sir we , held an official position in yangdschou . sir we had decided that it was time for his daughter to marry , so he sent for a match - maker and commissioned her to find a suitable husband . old dschang heard this , and was pleased . he prepared food and drink , entertained the match - maker , and told her to recommend him as a husband . but the old match - maker went off scolding . the next day he invited her to dinner again and gave her money . then the old match - maker said : " you do not know what you wish ! why should a gentleman 's beautiful daughter condescend to marry a poor old gardener like yourself ? even though you had money to burn , your white hair would not match her black locks . such a marriage is out of the question ! " but old dschang did not cease to entreat her : " make an attempt , just one attempt , to mention me ! if they will not listen to you , then i must resign myself to my fate ! "
