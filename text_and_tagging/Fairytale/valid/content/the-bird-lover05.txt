she had come to a bank , painted with flowers of every hue , and was reclining on its fragrant couch , when a bird , of red and deep - blue plumage softly blended , alighted on a branch near by , and began to pour forth its carol . it was a bird of strange character , such as she had never before seen . its first note was so delicious to the ear of minda , and it so pierced to her young heart , that she listened as she had never before to any mortal or heavenly sound . it seemed like the human voice , forbidden to speak , and uttering its language through this wild wood - chant with a mournful melody , as if it bewailed the lack of the power or the right to make itself more plainly intelligible . the voice of the bird rose and fell , and circled round and round , but whithersoever floated or spread out its notes , they seemed ever to have their center where minda sat ; and she looked with sad eyes into the sad eyes of the mournful bird , that sat in his red and deep - blue plumage just opposite to the flowery bank . the poor bird strove more and more with his voice , and seemed ever more and more anxiously to address his notes of lament to minda 's ear , till at last she could not refrain from saying , " what aileth thee , sad bird ?
