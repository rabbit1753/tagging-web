she was stupefied at first , but when they reached the waters she recovered her thoughts . after piercing down a great depth , they saw a green light towards the bottom . at last they were below the sea , that seemed a green sky above them ; and , sitting in a beautiful meadow , she half - asleep , and her head resting against his side . she could n't keep her eyes open , and she could n't tell how long she slept ; but when she woke , she was in bed at his house , and he and his mother sitting by her bedside , and watching her . it was a witch that had a spite to the young man because he would n't marry her , and so she got power to keep him in a state between life and death till a young woman would rescue him by doing what she had done . so , at her request , her sisters got their own shapes again , and were sent back to their mother , with their spades of gold and shovels of silver . maybe they were better after that , but i doubt it much . the youngest got the young gentleman for her husband . i 'm sure she lived happy , and , if they did n't live happy -- that we may !
