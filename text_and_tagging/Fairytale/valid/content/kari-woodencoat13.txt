at once the troll came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " oho , we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and rushed on the troll , gored him , and thrust his horns right through him . but the troll was just as strong , and it took three whole days before the bull got the better of him . after that he was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move , and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams . then he told the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . she did so , and he recovered again : yet they had to remain a time on the spot , until he was once more able to go on .
