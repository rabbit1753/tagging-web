" alas , alas ! " cried the bull . " what have you done ! now i must fight for my very life . but see that you keep the leaf carefully ! " straightway they reached the end of the forest , and at once a troll with three heads came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " was the bull 's reply . " we 'll see if it is ! " shouted the troll . " that suits me ! " cried the bull . then they rushed at each other , and the bull gored and butted with might and main . but the troll was just as strong , and it took all day before the bull gained the upper hand . and then he had so many wounds , and was so weak that he could scarcely walk . so they had to halt for a whole day ; but the bull told the queen 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . thereupon he grew strong and well again , and they went on the next day . now they wandered for many , many days , and at last came to a silver forest , whose trees , branches , leaves , buds and all were of silver . at once the troll came rushing up . " who has touched my forest ? " cried he . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " oho , we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and rushed on the troll , gored him , and thrust his horns right through him . but the troll was just as strong , and it took three whole days before the bull got the better of him . after that he was so weak and feeble that he could scarcely move , and so full of wounds that his blood ran in streams . then he told the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment that hung at the troll 's girdle , and anoint him with the salve . she did so , and he recovered again : yet they had to remain a time on the spot , until he was once more able to go on . but now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up , and he was so frightful that the king 's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him . " who has touched my forest ? " he shouted . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and with this they rushed on each other , so that it was a fearsome sight , and the king 's daughter nearly fainted . the bull gored the troll through and through with his horns ; but the troll was as strong as he , and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads , the others breathed fresh life into it , and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him . but then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit . his whole body was covered with wounds ; and he could not even tell the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll 's girdle and anoint him with the salve . but she did so of her own accord , and then he recovered again . yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks , until he was able to go on again .
