at her words the peerie folk shouted with laughter , till their straw - coloured hair tumbled right over their faces ; then they hopped on to the floor and ran out of the house , and presently they came trooping back holding cups of blue - bells , and foxgloves , and saucers of primroses and anemones in their hands ; and the princess put a tiny spoonful of porridge into each saucer , and a tiny drop of milk into each cup , and they ate it all up as daintily as possible with neat little grass spoons , which they had brought with them in their pockets . when they had finished they all cried out , " thank you ! thank you ! " and ran out of the kitchen again , leaving the princess alone . and , being alone , she went all over the house to look for her sisters , but , of course , she could not find them . " never mind , i will find them soon , " she said to herself . " to - morrow i will search the byre and the outhouses ; in the meantime , i had better get on with my work . " so she went back to the kitchen , and took out the bag of wool , which the giant had told her to make into cloth . but just as she was doing so the door opened once more , and a yellow - haired peerie boy entered . he was exactly like the other peerie folk who had eaten the princess 's porridge , only he was bigger , and he wore a very rich dress of grass - green velvet . he walked boldly into the middle of the kitchen and looked round him . " do you have any work for me to do ? " he asked . " i know grand how to handle wool and turn it into fine thick cloth . " " i have plenty of work for anybody who asks it , " replied the princess ; " but i have no money to pay for it , and there are but few folk in this world who will work without wages . " " all the wages that i ask is that tyou will take the trouble to find out my name , for few folk ken it , and few folk care to know . but if by any chance you can not find it out , then must you pay toll of half of your cloth .
