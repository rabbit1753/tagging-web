the manito began to be troubled with bad forebodings , for , on looking ahead , he saw the young hunter in his own manly form , running along at leisure . the mudjee monedo , seeing the necessity of more speed , now passed monedowa in the shape of a deer . they were now far around the circle of the lake , and fast closing in upon the starting - post , when monedowa , putting on his red and blue plumage , glided along the air and alighted upon the track far in advance . to overtake him , the old manito assumed the shape of the buffalo ; and he pushed on with such long gallops that he was again the foremost on the course . the buffalo was the last change he could make , and it was in this form that he had most frequently conquered . the young hunter , once more a bird , in the act of passing the manito , saw his tongue lolling from his mouth with fatigue . " my friend , " said monedowa , " is this all your speed ? " the manito made no answer . monedowa had resumed his character of a hunter , and was within a run of the winning - post , when the wicked manito had nearly overtaken him .
