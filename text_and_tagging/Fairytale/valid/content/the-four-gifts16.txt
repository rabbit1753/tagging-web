blushing with pleasure tephany went home and stuck the feather into the blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country . in a moment she heard denis whistling gaily , and as her aunt was safely counting her cabbages , she hurried out to meet him . the young man was struck dumb by her talk . there was nothing that she did not seem to know , and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of brittany , but could compose them herself . was this really the quiet girl who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her , or was it somebody else ? perhaps she had gone suddenly mad , and there was an evil spirit inside her . but in any case , night after night he came back , only to find her growing wiser and wiser . soon the neighbours whispered their surprise among themselves , for tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who despised her for her poor clothes , and many were the jokes she made about them . of course they heard of her jests , and shook their heads saying : ' she is an ill - natured little cat , and the man that marries her will find that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse . ' it was not long before denis began to agree with them , and as he always liked to be master wherever he went , he became afraid of tephany 's sharp tongue , and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other people he grew red and uncomfortable , thinking that his turn would come next .
