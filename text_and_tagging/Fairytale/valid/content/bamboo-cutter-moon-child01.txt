long , long ago , there lived an old bamboo wood - cutter . he was very poor and sad also , for no child had heaven sent to cheer his old age , and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave . every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky . when he had made his choice , he would cut down these feathers of the forest , and splitting them lengthwise , or cutting them into joints , would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles for the household , and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them .
