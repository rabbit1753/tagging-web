" you dare come into my presence , and tell me that there is some one living in my kingdom who is more handsomely housed than i , the king ! " shouted the king , beside himself with rage . he came near wringing the cat 's neck . " you might wait until you see it , " said the cat . and the king said yes , he would wait . " but if you have told me a falsehood , you shall die , and though you had seven lives , " said he . in the morning the king and the whole court set out to travel to ebe ashpeter 's castle . the cat was in the little hut , and called for ebe , thinking it would be best if both of them got underway an hour earlier . after they had gone a while , they met some folk who were herding sheep ; and the sheep were bleating and grazing over the whole plain . they were as large as full - grown calves , and their wool was so long that it dragged along the ground after them . " to whom do the sheep belong ? " asked the cat . " to helge - hal in the blue hill , " said the shepherds .
