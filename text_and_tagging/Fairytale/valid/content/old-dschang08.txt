once an aristocratic relative visited sir we and said : " if you had really been poor , were there not enough young gentlemen in the neighborhood for your daughter ? why did you have to marry her to such a wrinkled old gardener ? now that you have thrown her away , so to speak , it would be better if both of them left this part of the country . " then sir we prepared a banquet and invited his daughter and old dschang to visit him . when they had had sufficient to eat and drink he allowed them to get an inkling of what was in his mind .
