as the days went on tephany grew paler and paler , till everybody noticed it except her aunt . the water - pot was almost too heavy for her now , but morning and evening she carried it to the spring , though the effort to lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her . ' how could i have been so foolish , ' she whispered to herself , when she went down as usual at sunset . ' it was not freedom to see denis that i should have asked for , for he was soon weary of me , nor a quick tongue , for he was afraid of it , nor beauty , for that brought me nothing but trouble , but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others . ah ! if i only dared to beg this gift from the fairy , i should be wiser than before and know how to choose better . ' ' be satisfied , ' said the voice of the old woman , who seemed to be standing unseen at tephany 's elbow . ' if you look in your right - hand pocket when you go home you will find a small box . rub your eyes with the ointment it contains , and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless treasure . '
