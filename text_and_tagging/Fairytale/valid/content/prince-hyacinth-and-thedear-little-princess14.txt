" my dear prince , might i beg you to move a little more that way , for your nose casts such a shadow that i really can not see what i have on my plate . ah ! thanks . now let us speak of your father . when i went to his court he was only a little boy , but that is forty years ago , and i have been in this desolate place ever since . tell me what goes on nowadays ; are the ladies as fond of amusement as ever ? in my time one saw them at parties , theatres , balls , and promenades every day . dear me ! what a long nose you have ! i can not get used to it ! " " really , madam , " said the prince , " i wish you would leave off mentioning my nose . it can not matter to you what it is like . i am quite satisfied with it , and have no wish to have it shorter . one must take what is given one . " " now you are angry with me , my poor hyacinth , " said the fairy , " and i assure you that i did n't mean to vex you ; on the contrary , i wished to do you a service . however , though i really can not help your nose being a shock to me , i will try not to say anything about it . i will even try to think that you have an ordinary nose . to tell the truth , it would make three reasonable ones .
