the carriage was large and barred the narrow road , so tephany was forced , much against her will , to remain where she was . but she looked the young man full in the face as she answered : ' go your way , noble lord , and let me go mine . i am only a poor peasant girl , accustomed to milk , and make hay and spin . ' ' peasant you may be , but i will make you a great lady , ' said he , taking her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage . ' i do n't want to be a great lady , i only want to be the wife of denis , ' she replied , throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided the road from the cornfield , where he hoped to hide . unluckily the young man guessed what she was doing , and signed to his attendants , who seized her and put her in the coach . the door was banged , and the horses whipped up into a gallop . at the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle , and tephany , who would not move , was lifted out and carried into the hall , while a priest was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony . the young man tried to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as his wife , but tephany did not listen to him , and looked about to see if there was any means by which she could escape . it did not seem easy . the three great doors were closely barred , and the one through which she had entered shut with a spring , but her feather was still in her hair , and by its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling , through which a streak of light could be dimly seen . touching the copper pin which fastened her dress , the girl sent every one in the hall to count the cabbages , while she herself passed through the little door , not knowing whither she was going . by this time night had fallen , and tephany was very tired . thankfully she found herself at the gate of a convent , and asked if she might stay there till morning . but the portress answered roughly that it was no place for beggars , and bade her begone , so the poor girl dragged herself slowly along the road , till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was near a farm .
