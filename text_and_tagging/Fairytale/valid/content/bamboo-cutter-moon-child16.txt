that same evening the suitors arrived and began to play their flutes in turn , and to sing their self - composed songs telling of their great and tireless love . the bamboo - cutter went out to them and offered them his sympathy for all they had endured and all the patience they had shown in their desire to win his foster - daughter . then he gave them her message , that she would consent to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted . this was to test them . the five all accepted the trial , and thought it an excellent plan , for it would prevent jealousy between them .
