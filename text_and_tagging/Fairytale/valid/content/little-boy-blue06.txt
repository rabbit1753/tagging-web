" oh , never mind his name , papa ! " broke in the squire 's daughter ; " i shall call him little boy blue , since he is dressed in blue from head to foot , and his dress but matches his eyes . and you must give him a good wage , also , for surely no squire before ever had a prettier shepherd boy than this . " " very good , " said the squire , cheerfully , as he pinched his daughter 's rosy cheek ; " be watchful , little boy blue , and you shall be well paid . " then little boy blue thanked them both very sweetly and ran back over the hill and into the valley where his home lay nestled by the river - side , to tell the good news to his mother .
