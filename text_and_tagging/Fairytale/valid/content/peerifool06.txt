now the princess was no coward , so , although she had not expected to face a giant , she gathered up her courage , and cried out sharply , " who gave thee liberty to cut our cabbages ? leave off this minute , and go away . " the giant paid no heed , but went on steadily with what he was doing . " do you not hear me ? " cried the girl indignantly ; for she was the princess royal , and had always been accustomed to be obeyed . " if you will be not quiet i will take you too , " said the giant grimly , pressing the cabbages down into the creel . " i should like to see you try , " retorted the princess , rising from her stool and stamping her foot ; for she felt so angry that she forgot for a moment that she was only a weak maiden and he was a great and powerful giant . and , as if to show her how strong he was , he seized her by her arm and her leg , and put her in his creel on the top of the cabbages , and carried her away bodily . when he reached his home , which was in a great square house on a lonely moor , he took her out , and set her down roughly on the floor . " you will be my servant now , " he said , " and keep my house , and do my errands for me . i have a cow , which you must drive out every day to the hillside ; and see , here is a bag of wool , when you have taken out the cow , you must come back and settle thyself at home , as a good housewife should , and comb , and card it , and spin it into yarn , with which to weave a good thick cloth for my raiment . i am out most of the day , but when i come home i shall expect to find all this done , and a great bicker of porridge boiled besides for my supper .
