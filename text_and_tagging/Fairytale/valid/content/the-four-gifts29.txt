' take care not to let any of the neighbours hear of it , denis , ' said barbaik . ' of course you shall have your share , but nobody else shall get a single one . cry on , my dear , cry on , ' she continued to tephany . ' it is for your good as well as ours , ' and she held out her apron to catch them , and denis his hat . but tephany could hardly bear any more . she felt half choked at the sight of their greediness , and wanted to rush from the hall , and though barbaik caught her arm to prevent this , and said all sorts of tender words which she thought would make the girl weep the more , tephany with a violent effort forced back her tears , and wiped her eyes .
