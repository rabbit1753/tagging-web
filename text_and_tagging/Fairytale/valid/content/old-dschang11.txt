after a short time a maid - servant came and led him to the inner rooms , to his sister . the beams of her room were of sandalwood , the doors of tortoise - shell and the windows inlaid with blue jade ; her curtains were formed of strings of pearls and the steps leading into the room of green nephrite . his sister was magnificently gowned , and far more beautiful than before . she asked him carelessly how he was getting along , and what her parents were doing ; but was not very cordial . after a splendid meal she had an apartment prepared for him . " my sister wishes to make an excursion to the mountain of the fairies , " said old dschang to him . " we will be back about sunset , and you can rest until we return . "
