but one day a very sad thing happened -- at least , it was a sad thing for poor assipattle . for it chanced that the king of these parts had one only daughter , the princess gemdelovely , whom he loved dearly , and to whom he denied nothing . and princess gemdelovely was in want of a waiting - maid , and as she had seen assipattle 's sister standing by the garden gate as she was riding by one day , and had taken a fancy to her , she asked her father if she might ask her to come and live at the castle and serve her . her father agreed at once , as he always did agree to any of her wishes ; and sent a messenger in haste to the farmer 's house to ask if his daughter would come to the castle to be the princess 's waiting - maid . and , of course , the farmer was very pleased at the piece of good fortune which had befallen the girl , and so was her mother , and so were her six brothers , all except poor assipattle , who looked with wistful eyes after his sister as she rode away , proud of her new clothes and of the rivlins which her father had made her out of cowhide , which she was to wear in the palace when she waited on the princess , for at home she always ran barefoot .
