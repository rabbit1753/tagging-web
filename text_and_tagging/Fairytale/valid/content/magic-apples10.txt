when the king 's daughter had eaten of the apples , she had a pair of horns . and then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to hear . and the castle was hung with black , and in the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help the king 's daughter should get her , and half the kingdom besides . then tom , dick and harry , and the best physicians in the country came along . but none of them could help the princess . but one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court . he was not from their country , he said , and had made the journey purposely just to try his luck here . but he must see the king 's daughter alone , said he , and permission was granted him .
