now the queen was the king 's second wife , and she was not a favourite in the kingdom , for she was a proud , insolent woman , who did not behave kindly to her step - daughter , the princess gemdelovely , and who spent much more of her time in the company of a great sorcerer , whom everyone feared and dreaded , than she did in that of the king , her husband . so the sober counsellors looked at her disapprovingly as she came boldly into the council chamber and stood up beside the king 's chair of state , and , speaking in a loud , clear voice , addressed them thus : " ye think that ye are brave men and strong , oh , ye elders , and fit to be the protectors of the people . and so it may be , when it is mortals that ye are called on to face . but ye be no match for the foe that now threatens our land . before him your weapons be but as straw . it is not through strength of arm , but through sorcery , that he will be overcome . so listen to my words , even though they be but those of a woman , and take counsel with the great sorcerer , from whom nothing is hid , but who knoweth all the mysteries of the earth , and of the air , and of the sea .
