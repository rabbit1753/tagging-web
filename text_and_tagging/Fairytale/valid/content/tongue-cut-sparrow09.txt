in the evening the old man came home . as usual , on the way back he looked forward to the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him , ruffling out her feathers to show her joy , and at last coming to rest on his shoulder . but to - night the old man was very disappointed , for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen . he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals , and stepped on to the veranda . still no sparrow was to be seen . he now felt sure that his wife , in one of her cross tempers , had shut the sparrow up in its cage . so he called her and said anxiously : " where is suzume san ( miss sparrow ) today ?
