this knowe of which he spoke was a little green hillock , which stood on the moor not twenty yards from the garden gate , and folk said that it was the abode of fairies , who would punish any rash mortal who came too near them . and because of this the country people would walk a good half - mile out of their way , even in broad daylight , rather than run the risk of going too near the fairy knowe and bringing down the little folks ' displeasure upon them . and at night they would hardly cross the moor at all , for everyone knows that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands open , so that any luckless mortal who does not take care may find himself inside . now , the little page - boy was an adventurous wight , and instead of being frightened of the fairies , he was very anxious to see them , and to visit their abode , just to find out what it was like .
