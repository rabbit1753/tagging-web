the following sunday some one had to go up to the prince , and bring him a towel . " can not i go up ? " begged kari . " is that all you want ? " said the rest in the kitchen . " you saw yourself what happened to you the last time ! " but kari kept on asking , and finally she received permission , after all , and ran up the stairs so that her wooden coat fairly clattered . the prince at once thrust his head out of the door , and when he saw that it was kari , he tore the towel out of her hand and flung it at her head . " off with you , you horrid creature ! " cried he . " do you think i want a towel that you have touched with your dirty fingers ? "
