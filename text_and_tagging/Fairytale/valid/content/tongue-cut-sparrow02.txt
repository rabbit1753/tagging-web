when he came back at night after his hard day 's work in the open air it was his only pleasure to pet the sparrow , to talk to her and to teach her little tricks , which she learned very quickly . the old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room , and they would play together . then when supper - time came , he always saved some tit - bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird .
