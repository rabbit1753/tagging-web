but now the troll with the nine heads came rushing up , and he was so frightful that the king 's daughter could scarcely bear to look at him . " who has touched my forest ? " he shouted . " the forest is as much mine as yours ! " cried the bull . " we 'll see if it is ! " cried the troll . " that suits me ! " said the bull , and with this they rushed on each other , so that it was a fearsome sight , and the king 's daughter nearly fainted . the bull gored the troll through and through with his horns ; but the troll was as strong as he , and as soon as the bull killed one of his heads , the others breathed fresh life into it , and it took a full week before the bull got the better of him . but then he was so wretched and so weak that he could not move a bit . his whole body was covered with wounds ; and he could not even tell the king 's daughter to take the horn of ointment from the troll 's girdle and anoint him with the salve . but she did so of her own accord , and then he recovered again . yet they had to stay where they were for three whole weeks , until he was able to go on again . at last they once more went slowly on their way ; for the bull said they still had a little further to go , and they went over many great hills and through thick forests . after a time they came to a rock . " do you see anything ? " asked the bull . " no , i see only the sky and the rock , " said the king 's daughter . but when they went on up the hills were more level , so that they had a broader outlook . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , i see a small castle , far , far in the distance , " said the princess . " and yet it is not so small , " said the bull . at length they came to a great mountain with a steep , rocky face . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , now i see the castle close by , and it is much , much larger , " said the king 's daughter . " that is where you must go ! " said the bull .
