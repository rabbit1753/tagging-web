quite a few of the folks at home , to whom he described his adventures , thought that old dschang must be a holy man , while others regarded the whole thing a magic vision . after five or six years sir we 's money came to an end . so his son took the straw hat to yangdschou and there asked for old wang . the latter just happened to be standing in his drug - shop , mixing herbs . when the son explained his errand he said : " the money is ready . but is your hat genuine ? " and he took the hat and examined it . a young girl came from an inner room and said : " i wove the hat for old dschang myself . there must be a red thread in it . " and sure enough , there was . then old wang gave young we the ten million pieces of copper , and the latter now believed that old dschang was really a saint . so he once more went over the hills to look for him . he asked the forest - keepers , but they could tell him naught . sadly he retraced his steps and decided to inquire of old wang , but he had also disappeared . when several years had passed he once more came to yangdschou , and was walking in the meadow before the city gate . there he met old dschang 's plow - boy . the latter cried out : " how are you ? how are you ? " and drew out ten pounds of gold , which he gave to him , saying : " my mistress told me to give you this . my master is this very moment drinking tea with old wang in the inn . " young we followed the plow - boy , intending to greet his brother - in - law . but when he reached the inn there was no one in sight . and when he turned around the plow - boy had disappeared as well . and since that time no one ever heard from old dschang again .
