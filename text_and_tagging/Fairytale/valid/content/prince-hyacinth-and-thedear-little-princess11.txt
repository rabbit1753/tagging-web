the old fairy , who wished to make him happy , at last hit upon a plan . she shut the dear little princess up in a palace of crystal , and put this palace down where the prince would not fail to find it . his joy at seeing the princess again was extreme , and he set to work with all his might to try to break her prison ; but in spite of all his efforts he failed utterly . in despair he thought at least that he would try to get near enough to speak to the dear little princess , who , on her part , stretched out her hand that he might kiss it ; but turn which way he might , he never could raise it to his lips , for his long nose always prevented it . for the first time he realized how long it really was , and exclaimed : " well , it must be admitted that my nose is too long !
