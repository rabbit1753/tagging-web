" just below the castle is a pig - sty , and if you go into it you will find a wooden coat . you must put it on , and go with it into the castle , and say your name is kari woodencoat , and ask for a place . but now take your little knife and cut off my head ; then draw off my skin , roll it up and lay it at the foot of the rock . but in it you must place the copper leaf , and the silver leaf , and the golden apple . outside , against the hill , is a stick , and if you want anything of me , all you need do is to knock at the mountain - side . " at first the princess could not at all make up her mind to do this ; but when the bull told her that this was the only reward he wanted for all the good he had done her , she could not refuse . it made her heart ache , yet in spite of it , she took her knife and cut until she had cut off the head of the great beast , and had drawn off his skin , and then she laid the latter at the foot of the rock , and in it she placed the copper leaf , and the silver leaf , and the golden apple .
