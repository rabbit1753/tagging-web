" i will be avenged on him for his cruelty , " said the little princess firmly ; and when she spoke like that her sisters knew that she meant what she said . so next morning , before the giant was up , she fetched his creel , and put her eldest sister into it , and covered her with all the fine silken hangings and tapestry that she could find , and on the top of all she put a handful of grass , and when the giant came downstairs she asked him , in her sweetest tone , if he would do her a favour . and the giant , who was very pleased with her because of the quantity of cloth which he thought she had spun , said that he would . " then carry that creelful of grass home to my mother 's cottage for her cow to eat , " said the princess . " this will help to make up for all the cabbages which you have stolen from her kailyard . "
