for he said that the only way to satisfy the monster , and to make it spare the land , was to feed it every saturday with seven young maidens , who must be the fairest who could be found ; and if , after this remedy had been tried once or twice , it did not succeed in mollifying the stoorworm and inducing him to depart , there was but one other measure that he could suggest , but that was so horrible and dreadful that he would not rend their hearts by mentioning it in the meantime . and as , although they hated him , they feared him also , the council had e'en to abide by his words , and pronounced the awful doom . and so it came about that , every saturday , seven bonnie , innocent maidens were bound hand and foot and laid on a rock which ran into the sea , and the monster stretched out his long , jagged tongue , and swept them into his mouth ; while all the rest of the folk looked on from the top of a high hill -- or , at least , the men looked -- with cold , set faces , while the women hid theirs in their aprons and wept aloud .
