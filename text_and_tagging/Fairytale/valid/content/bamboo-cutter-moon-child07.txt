at last the day came for the naming of their new - found child , so the old couple called in a celebrated name - giver , and he gave her the name of princess moonlight , because her body gave forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the moon god . for three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music . all the friends and relations of the old couple were present , and great was their enjoyment of the festivities held to celebrate the naming of princess moonlight . everyone who saw her declared that there never had been seen any one so lovely ; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of the land would grow pale beside her , so they said . the fame of the princess 's loveliness spread far and wide , and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand , or even so much as to see her .
