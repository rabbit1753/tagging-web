after this she finished her porridge in peace ; then she took the wool out of the bag , and she set to work to comb and card it . but it seemed as if it were bewitched ; it curled and twisted and coiled itself round her fingers so that , try as she would , she could not do anything with it . and when the giant came home he found her sitting in despair with it all in confusion round her , and the porridge , which she had left for him in the pot , burned to a cinder . as you may imagine , he was very angry , and raged , and stamped , and used the most dreadful words ; and at last he took her by the heels , and beat her until all her back was skinned and bleeding ; then he carried her out to the byre , and threw her up on the joists among the hens . and , although she was not dead , she was so stunned and bruised that she could only lie there motionless , looking down on the backs of the cows . time went on , and in the kailyard at home the cabbages were disappearing as fast as ever . so the second princess said that she would do as her sister had done , and wrap herself in a blanket , and go and sit on a three - legged stool all night , to see what was becoming of them .
