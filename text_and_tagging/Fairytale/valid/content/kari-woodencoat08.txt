in the meantime the bull trotted through many lands with the king 's daughter , and they came to a great copper forest , whose trees , leaves and flowers were all of copper . but before they entered it , the bull said to the king 's daughter : " now when we get into the forest you must be very careful not to touch so much as a single leaf , or else it is all up with you and with me ; for a troll with three heads lives here , and the forest belongs to him . " yes , indeed , she would be careful , and not touch anything . and she was very careful , and leaned to one side , and thrust aside the branches ; but the forest was so thick that it was almost impossible to win through , and for all that she was so careful , she did tear off a leaf , and it remained in her hand .
