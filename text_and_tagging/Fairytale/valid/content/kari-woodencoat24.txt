and then , as she ran up the stairs , her wooden coat clattered so loudly that the prince came out and asked : " and who are you ? " " i came to bring you water to wash in , " said kari . " do you think i want the water you are bringing me ? " cried the prince , and poured the water out over her head . so she had to go off ; but she asked permission to go to church . and she received permission , for the church was close by . but first she went to the rock and knocked at it with a stick , as the bull had told her . and a man came out at once and asked what she wanted . the king 's daughter said that she had permission to go to church and hear the sermon , but that she had no dress to wear . then the man gave her a dress that shone like the copper forest , and a horse and a saddle as well . when she came to church she looked so beautiful that all the people wondered who she might be , and none of them listened to the sermon , because they were all looking at her . she even pleased the prince so much that he could not keep from looking at her .
