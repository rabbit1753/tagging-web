" i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bull elk for courier service . " it was quite clear that should the king want a swift messenger , some time , he could not find a swifter in all his kingdom . " this ebe must be a most distinguished lord , since he finds such presents for me , " said the king . " yes , indeed , one might call him a distinguished lord , " said the cat , " his wealth is without end or limit . " but no matter how many other questions the king asked , he received no more explicit information . " tell him that i am much obliged , and to do me the honor to call when he is passing here some time , " said the king , and sent him a robe as handsome as the one he himself was wearing , and three cartloads of handsome presents . but ebe did not even want to put on the royal robe , and hardly looked at the other presents .
