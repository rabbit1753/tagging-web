this knowe of which he spoke was a little green hillock , which stood on the moor not twenty yards from the garden gate , and folk said that it was the abode of fairies , who would punish any rash mortal who came too near them . and because of this the country people would walk a good half - mile out of their way , even in broad daylight , rather than run the risk of going too near the fairy knowe and bringing down the little folks ' displeasure upon them . and at night they would hardly cross the moor at all , for everyone knows that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands open , so that any luckless mortal who does not take care may find himself inside . now , the little page - boy was an adventurous wight , and instead of being frightened of the fairies , he was very anxious to see them , and to visit their abode , just to find out what it was like . so one night , when everyone else was asleep , he crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps , and along the sea shore , and up on to the moor , and went straight to the fairy knowe . to his delight he found that what everyone said was true . the top of the knowe was tipped up , and from the opening that was thus made , rays of light came streaming out . his heart was beating fast with excitement , but , gathering his courage , he stooped down and slipped inside the knowe .
