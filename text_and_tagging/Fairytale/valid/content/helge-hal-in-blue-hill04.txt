" if you do not go where i want you to , i 'll scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said she . so the buck did not dare do anything save what the cat wished , and off they went over stick and stone , from cliff to cliff , close by ebe , who was just polishing the door - sill of his house , and with one bound right into the castle . " i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might care to have this buck reindeer to drive , " said the cat . yes , he could make good use of such a young , handsome animal , some time , when he had occasion to drive out to visit a neighboring king . " this ebe must be a proud and powerful lord , " said the king , " if he can make me such presents . " " yes , he is the greatest lord in all your land and kingdom , " said the cat , but no matter how many questions the king asked , he learned nothing more .
