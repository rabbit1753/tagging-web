this advice pleased the cat , and she caught a mouse . then she wanted to go to the house in which stood the chest , and the dog came after . they came to a broad river . and since the cat could not swim , the dog took her on his back and swam across with her . then the cat carried the mouse to the house in which the chest stood . the mouse gnawed a hole in the chest , and fetched out the ring . the cat put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting for her , and swam across with her . then they started out together for home , in order to bring the lucky ring to their master and mistress . but the dog could only run along the ground ; when there was a house in the way he always had to go around it . the cat , however , quickly climbed over the roof , and so she reached home long before the dog , and brought the ring to her master .
