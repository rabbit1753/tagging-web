little boy blue came homeward one evening very light of heart and whistled merrily as he walked , for he thought he should find his mother awaiting him at the stile and a good supper spread upon the table in the little cottage . but when he came to the stile his mother was not in sight , and in answer to his call a low moan of pain reached his ears . little boy blue sprang over the stile and found lying upon the ground his dear mother , her face white and drawn with suffering , and tears of anguish running down her cheeks . for she had slipped upon the stile and fallen , and her leg was broken !
