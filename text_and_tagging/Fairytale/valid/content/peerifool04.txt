so the eldest princess said she would take out a three - legged stool , and wrap herself in a blanket , and sit in the kailyard all night to see if she could catch the thief . and , although it was very cold and very dark , she did so . at first it seemed as if all her trouble would be in vain , for hour after hour passed and nothing happened . but in the small hours of the morning , just as the clock was striking two , she heard a stealthy trampling in the field behind , as if some very heavy person were trying to tread very softly , and presently a mighty giant stepped right over the wall into the kailyard . he carried an enormous creel on his arm , and a large , sharp knife in his hand ; and he began to cut the cabbages , and to throw them into the creel as fast as he could . now the princess was no coward , so , although she had not expected to face a giant , she gathered up her courage , and cried out sharply , " who gave thee liberty to cut our cabbages ? leave off this minute , and go away . " the giant paid no heed , but went on steadily with what he was doing . " do you not hear me ? " cried the girl indignantly ; for she was the princess royal , and had always been accustomed to be obeyed . " if you will be not quiet i will take you too , " said the giant grimly , pressing the cabbages down into the creel . " i should like to see you try , " retorted the princess , rising from her stool and stamping her foot ; for she felt so angry that she forgot for a moment that she was only a weak maiden and he was a great and powerful giant .
