the poor princess was very dismayed when she heard these words , for she had never been accustomed to work hard , and she had always had her sisters to help her ; but the giant took no notice of her distress , but went out as soon as it was daylight , leaving her alone in the house to begin her work . as soon as he had gone she drove the cow to the pasture , as he had told her to do ; but she had a good long walk over the moor before she reached the hill , and by the time that she got back to the house she felt very tired . so she thought that she would put on the porridge pot , and make herself some porridge before she began to card and comb the wool . she did so , and just as she was sitting down to sup them the door opened , and a crowd of wee , wee peerie folk came in .
