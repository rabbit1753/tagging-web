when the hunt was over , in came a long procession with banners and standards . they wore swords at their side and bore spears in their hands , and came to a halt in the north - west corner of the room . they were followed by several hundred serving - men . these brought with them curtains and covers , tents and tent - poles , pots and kettles , cups and plates , tables and chairs . and after them some hundreds of other servants carried in all sorts of fine dishes , the best that land and water had to offer . and several hundred more ran to and fro without stopping , in order to guard the roads and carry messages .
