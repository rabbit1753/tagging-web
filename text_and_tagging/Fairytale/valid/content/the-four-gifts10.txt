next evening , at the moment when denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse , tephany stuck the pin in her dress , and at the very same instant barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields , to the plot where the cabbages grew . with a heart as light as her footsteps , the girl ran from the house , and spent her evening happily with denis . and so it was for many days after that . then , at last , tephany began to notice something , and the something made her very sad . at first , denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did , but when he had taught her all the songs he knew , and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man , he had nothing more to say to her , for he , like a great many other people , was fond of talking himself , but not of listening to any one else . sometimes , indeed , he never came at all , and the next evening he would tell tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business , but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do .
