light of heart the king 's son went on his road , till he came to the green valley near his father 's palace . slowly he unloosed the bundle , fearing lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags . but no ! all was as it had been before , and as he opened the castle door there stood within the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen . ' enter , king 's son , ' said she , ' all is ready , and we will be married at once , ' and so they were . the maiden proved a good wife , and the king 's son , now himself a king , was so happy that he forgot all about the giant . seven years and a day had gone by , when one morning , while standing on the ramparts , he beheld the giant striding towards the castle . then he remembered his promise , and remembered , too , that he had told the queen nothing about it . now he must tell her , and perhaps she might help him in his trouble . the queen listened in silence to his tale , and after he had finished , she only said : ' leave the matter between me and the giant , ' and as she spoke , the giant entered the hall and stood before them . ' bring out your son , ' cried he to the king , ' as you promised me seven years and a day since . '
