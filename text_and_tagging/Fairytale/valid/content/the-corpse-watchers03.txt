about a week after , the second daughter went to seek her fortune , and she did n't care for her mother 's blessing no more nor her sister , and the very same thing happened to her . she was left a grey flag by the side of the other . at last the youngest went off in search of the other two , and she took care to carry her mother 's blessing with her . she shared her dinner with the poor woman on the road , and she told her that she would watch over her . well , she got lodging in the same place as the others , and agreed to mind the corpse . she sat up by the fire , with the dog and cat , and amused herself with some apples and nuts the mistress had given her . she thought it a pity that the man under the table was a corpse , he was so handsome . but at last he got up , and , says he , " all alone , fair maid ? " and she was n't long about an answer : all alone i am not , i 've little dog douse , and pussy , my cat ; i 've apples to roast and nuts to crack , and all alone i am not . " ho , ho ! " says he , " you 're a girl of courage , though you would n't have enough to follow me . i am now going to cross the quaking bog , and go through the burning forest . i must then enter the cave of terror and climb the hill of glass , and drop from the top of it into the dead sea . " " i 'll follow you , " says she , " for i engaged to mind you . " he thought to prevent her , but she was stiff as he was stout .
