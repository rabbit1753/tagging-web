assipattle , sailing slowly over the sea , and watching the mester stoorworm intently , noticed that the terrible monster yawned occasionally , as if longing for his weekly feast . and as it yawned a great flood of sea - water went down its throat , and came out again at its huge gills . so the brave lad took down his sail , and pointed the prow of his boat straight at the monster 's mouth , and the next time it yawned he and his boat were sucked right in , and , like jonah , went straight down its throat into the dark regions inside its body . on and on the boat floated ; but as it went the water grew less , pouring out of the stoorworm 's gills , till at last it stuck , as it were , on dry land . and assipattle jumped out , his pot in his hand , and began to explore . presently he came to the huge creature 's liver , and having heard that the liver of a fish is full of oil , he made a hole in it and put in the live peat . woe 's me ! but there was a conflagration ! and assipattle just got back to his boat in time ; for the mester stoorworm , in its convulsions , threw the boat right out of its mouth again , and it was flung up , high and dry , on the bare land . the commotion in the sea was so terrible that the king and his daughter -- who by this time had come down to the shore dressed like a bride , in white , ready to be thrown to the monster -- and all his courtiers , and all the country - folk , were fain to take refuge on the hill top , out of harm 's way , and stand and see what happened next . and this was what happened next .
