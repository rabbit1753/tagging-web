it was now time for him to return , for his retinue would be wondering what had happened to their royal master when they missed him for so long . so he bade her good - by , and left the house with a sad heart . princess moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world ; all others were dark beside her , and he thought of her night and day . his majesty now spent much of his time in writing poems , telling her of his love and devotion , and sent them to her , and though she refused to see him again she answered with many verses of her own composing , which told him gently and kindly that she could never marry any one on this earth . these little songs always gave him pleasure . at this time her foster - parents noticed that night after night the princess would sit on her balcony and gaze for hours at the moon , in a spirit of the deepest dejection , ending always in a burst of tears . one night the old man found her thus weeping as if her heart were broken , and he besought her to tell him the reason of her sorrow .
