next day there arrived one of the other young men , and in the evening , when the shoemaker had gone out and they were alone , she said to him , ' see if the latch is on the door . ' the young man hastened to do her bidding , but as soon as he touched the latch , his fingers stuck to it , and there he had to stay for many hours , till the shoemaker came back , and the girl let him go . hanging his head , he went home , but he told no one what had befallen him . then was the turn of the third man , and his foot remained fastened to the floor , till the girl unloosed it . and thankfully , he ran off , and was not seen looking behind him . ' take the purse of gold , ' said the girl to the shoemaker , ' i have no need of it , and it will better thee . ' and the shoemaker took it and told the girl he must carry the shoes for the wedding up to the castle . ' i would fain get a sight of the king 's son before he marries , ' sighed she . ' come with me , then , ' answered he ; ' the servants are all my friends , and they will let you stand in the passage down which the king 's son will pass , and all the company too . '
