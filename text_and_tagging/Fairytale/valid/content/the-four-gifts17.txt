so matters went on till one evening denis told tephany that he really could not stay a moment , as he had promised to go to a dance that was to be held in the next village . tephany 's face fell ; she had worked hard all day , and had been counting on a quiet hour with denis . she did her best to persuade him to remain with her , but he would not listen , and at last she grew angry . ' oh , i know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance , ' she said ; ' it is because aziliez of pennenru will be there . ' now aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round , and she and denis had known each other from childhood . ' oh yes , aziliez will be there , ' answered denis , who was quite pleased to see her jealous , ' and naturally one would go a long way to watch her dance . ' ' go then ! ' cried tephany , and entering the house she slammed the door behind her .
