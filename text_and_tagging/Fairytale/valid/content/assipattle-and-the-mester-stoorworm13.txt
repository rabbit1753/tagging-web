" the poor bairn 's mad ; the sight hath turned his head , " they whispered one to another ; and they would have crowded round him to pet and comfort him , but his elder brother came and gave him a heavy clout on the side of his head . " thou fight the stoorworm ! " he cried contemptuously . " a likely story ! go home to thy ash - pit , and stop speaking havers ; " and , taking his arm , he drew him to the place where his other brothers were waiting , and they all went home together . but all the time assipattle kept on saying that he meant to kill the stoorworm ; and at last his brothers became so angry at what they thought was mere bragging , that they picked up stones and pelted him so hard with them that at last he took to his heels and ran away from them . that evening the six brothers were threshing corn in the barn , and assipattle , as usual , was lying among the ashes thinking his own thoughts , when his mother came out and bade him run and tell the others to come in for their supper .
