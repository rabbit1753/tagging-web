there once lived a poor widow who supported herself and her only son by gleaning in the fields the stalks of grain that had been missed by the reapers . her little cottage was at the foot of a beautiful valley , upon the edge of the river that wound in and out among the green hills ; and although poor , she was contented with her lot , for her home was pleasant and her lovely boy was a constant delight to her . he had big blue eyes , and fair golden curls , and he loved his good mother very dearly , and was never more pleased than when she allowed him to help her with her work .
