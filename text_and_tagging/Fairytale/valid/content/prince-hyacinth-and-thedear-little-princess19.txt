at last , however , he was lucky enough to come upon puss fast asleep and with his tail conveniently spread out . so the king , without losing a moment , set his foot upon it heavily . with one terrific yell the cat sprang up and instantly changed into a tall man , who , fixing his angry eyes upon the king , said : " you shall marry the princess because you have been able to break the enchantment , but i will have my revenge . you shall have a son , who will never be happy until he finds out that his nose is too long , and if you ever tell anyone what i have just said to you , you shall vanish away instantly , and no one shall ever see you or hear of you again . " though the king was horribly afraid of the enchanter , he could not help laughing at this threat . " if my son has such a long nose as that , " he said to himself , " he must always see it or feel it ; at least , if he is not blind or without hands . " but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him . but after all , they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called hyacinth . the little prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas ! his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face . the queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose , but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked ; that it was a roman nose , and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose . the queen , who was devoted to her baby , was pleased with what they told her , and when she looked at hyacinth again , his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large .
