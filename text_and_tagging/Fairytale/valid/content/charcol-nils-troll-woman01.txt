in the old days there lived on a headland that juts out into the northwestern corner of lake rasval , in the neighborhood of the linde mining - district , a charcoal - burner named nils , generally known as charcoal nils . he let a farm - hand attend to his little plot of land , and he himself made his home in the forest , where he chopped wood in the summer and burned it to charcoal in the winter . yet no matter how hard he struggled , his work was unblessed with reward , and no one ever spoke of him save as poor charcoal nils .
