" the princess was willing , and he went away , and was gone for eighteen years . meanwhile the princess lived in want and affliction , for her father remained hard and merciless . if her mother had not secretly given her food and money , no doubt she would have starved to death during all that time . " i have been waiting for him to return . " " do you wish to marry some one else , seeing that he has been missing so long ? " " no , i will remain his wife until i die . "
