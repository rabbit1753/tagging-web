" many times . but the old woman , after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the gold and silver were over , could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature . she now began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents , for in the innocence of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows had offered him , preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home . " you silly old man , " said she , " why did you not bring the large box ? just think what we have lost . we might have had twice as much silver and gold as this . you are certainly an old fool ! " she screamed , and then went to bed as angry as she could be .
