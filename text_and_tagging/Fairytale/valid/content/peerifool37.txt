and , wonderful to relate , the giant did as he was bid , and carried the creel to the cottage . next morning she put her second sister into another creel , and covered her with all the fine napery she could find in the house , and put an armful of grass on the top of it , and at her bidding the giant , who was really getting very fond of her , carried it also home to her mother . the next morning the little princess told him that she thought that she would go for a long walk after she had done her housework , and that she might not be in when he came home at night , but that she would have another creel of grass ready for him , if he would carry it to the cottage as he had done on the two previous evenings . he promised to do so ; then , as usual , he went out for the day .
