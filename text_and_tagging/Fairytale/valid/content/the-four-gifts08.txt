' take this , ' she said ; ' to - day at any rate you shall dine well , ' and the old woman took it , gazing at tephany the while . ' those who help others deserve to be helped , ' she answered ; ' your eyes are still red because that miser barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from plover . but cheer up , you are a good girl , and i will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day . ' ' you ? ' cried tephany , stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs , but the old woman did not hear her . ' take this long copper pin , ' she went on , ' and every time you stick it in your dress mother bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages . as long as the pin is in your dress you will be free , and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again . ' then , rising , she nodded to tephany and vanished . the girl stood where she was , as still as a stone . if it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming . but by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her , but a fairy , wise in telling what would happen in the days to come . then suddenly tephany 's eyes fell on the clothes , and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour . next evening , at the moment when denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse , tephany stuck the pin in her dress , and at the very same instant barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields , to the plot where the cabbages grew . with a heart as light as her footsteps , the girl ran from the house , and spent her evening happily with denis . and so it was for many days after that . then , at last , tephany began to notice something , and the something made her very sad . at first , denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did , but when he had taught her all the songs he knew , and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man , he had nothing more to say to her , for he , like a great many other people , was fond of talking himself , but not of listening to any one else . sometimes , indeed , he never came at all , and the next evening he would tell tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business , but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do .
