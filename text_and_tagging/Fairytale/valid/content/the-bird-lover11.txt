by his invitation his wife , minda , the mother and her young son , attended monedowa to the manito 's racing - ground . the lodge of the manito stood upon a high ground , and near it stretched out a long row of other lodges , said to be possessed by wicked kindred of his , who shared in the spoils of his cruelty . as soon as the young hunter and his party approached , the inmates appeared at their lodge - doors and cried out : " we are visited . " at this cry , the mudjee monedo came forth and descended with his companions to the starting - post on the plain . from this the course could be seen , winding in a long girdle about the lake ; and as they were now all assembled , the old manito began to speak of the race , belted himself up and pointed to the post , which was an upright pillar of stone . " but before we start , " said the manito , " i wish it to be understood that when men run with me i make a wager , and i expect them to abide by it - life against life . " " very well - be it so , " answered monedowa . " we shall see whose head is to be dashed against the stone . " " we shall , " rejoined the mudjee monedo . " i am very old , but i shall try and make a run . " " very well , " again rejoined monedowa ; " i hope we shall both stand to our bargain . "
