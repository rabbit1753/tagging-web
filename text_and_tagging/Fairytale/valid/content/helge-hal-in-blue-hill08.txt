on the third day they set out again , the cat in the lead , and ebe following . after a time it occurred to him to go back and let the mice out of the house , so that they would not be altogether starved in the old hut ; and the cat tripped on alone . after she had gone her way , tipp , tapp , tipp , tapp , for a while , she came to a dense pine forest , and there she met a father bear , a mother bear and a baby bear . the cat crept softly up to them , and all at once she was hanging by her claws to the father bear 's head .
