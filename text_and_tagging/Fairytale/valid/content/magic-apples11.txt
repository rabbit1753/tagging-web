he went from city to city , and sailed from country to country ; but it was a long journey , and lasted a year and a day , and even longer . but one day he got there after all . it was a sunday , and he found out that the king 's daughter was at church . then he sat himself down with his apples before the church door , and pretended to be a peddler . " apples of damascus ! apples of damascus ! " he cried . and sure enough , the king 's daughter came , and told her maidens to go and see what desirable things the peddler from abroad might have to offer . yes , he had apples of damascus . " what do the apples give one ? " asked the maiden . " wisdom and beauty ! " said the peddler , and the maiden bought . when the king 's daughter had eaten of the apples , she had a pair of horns . and then there was such a wailing in the castle that it was pitiful to hear . and the castle was hung with black , and in the whole kingdom proclamation was made from all pulpits that whoever could help the king 's daughter should get her , and half the kingdom besides . then tom , dick and harry , and the best physicians in the country came along . but none of them could help the princess . but one day a foreign doctor from afar came to court . he was not from their country , he said , and had made the journey purposely just to try his luck here . but he must see the king 's daughter alone , said he , and permission was granted him .
