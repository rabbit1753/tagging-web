" but where is kari woodencoat ? " asked the prince , for he had understood the song of the bird , and remembered it well . " o she ! " said the others . " it is not worth while having her come , for she has feet like a horse . " " be that as it may , " said the prince . " but all the rest have tried it on , so she shall try it on as well . kari ! " he called out through the door , and kari came clattering up the stairs so that everything shook , just as though a whole regiment of dragoons had arrived . " now you shall try on the golden shoe , and be a princess ! " said the others , and made fun of her . but kari took the shoe , put her foot into it without a bit of trouble , cast off her wooden coat , and stood there in her golden dress , so that she was all a - sparkle , and on her other foot she had the golden shoe 's mate . the prince recognized her at once , put his arm around her , and kissed her . and she told him that she was a king 's daughter , which made him still more happy , and then they celebrated their wedding . " spin , span , spun , now our tale is done ! "
