and the tree broke at once into blossom , and the birds came and sang on it , and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the giant 's neck , and kissed him . and the other children , when they saw that the giant was not wicked any longer , came running back , and with them came the spring . " it is your garden now , little children , " said the giant , and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall . and when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen . all day long they played , and in the evening they came to the giant to bid him good - bye . " but where is your little companion ? " he said : " the boy i put into the tree . " the giant loved him the best because he had kissed him . " we do n't know , " answered the children ; " he has gone away . "
