he had no sooner left the lodge and got out of sight , than the son - in - law made his appearance with two more deer . on being made acquainted with the conduct of the manito , " very well , " he said , " i will be at home the next time , to see him . " both the mother and the wife urged monedowa to be aware of the manito . they made known to him all of his cruel courses , and assured him that no man could escape from his power . " no matter , " said monedowa ; " if he invites me to the race - ground , i will not be backward . what follows , may teach him , my mother , to show pity on the vanquished , and not to trample on the widow and those who are without fathers . " when the day of the visit of the manito arrived , monedowa told his wife to prepare certain pieces of meat , which he pointed out to her , together with two or three buds of the birch - tree , which he requested her to put in the pot . he directed also that the manito should be hospitably received , as if he had been just the kind - hearted old indian he professed to be . monedowa then dressed himself as a warrior , embellishing his visage with tints of red , to show that he was prepared for either war or peace .
