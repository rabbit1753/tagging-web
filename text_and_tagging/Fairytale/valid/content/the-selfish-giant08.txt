" you must tell him to be sure and come here to - morrow , " said the giant . but the children said that they did not know where he lived , and had never seen him before ; and the giant felt very sad . every afternoon , when school was over , the children came and played with the giant . but the little boy whom the giant loved was never seen again . the giant was very kind to all the children , yet he longed for his first little friend , and often spoke of him . " how i would like to see him ! " he used to say . years went over , and the giant grew very old and feeble . he could not play about any more , so he sat in a huge armchair , and watched the children at their games , and admired his garden .
