in a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful - the open plain , with its free sunshine and winds and flowers , or the close wood , with its delicious twilight - walks and enamored haunts - there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old indian . although the country furnished an abundance of game , and whatever else a good heart could wish for , it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands . he made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power , for the purpose of killing them . the country had been once thickly peopled , but this mudjee monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices , that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness . the secret of his success lay in his great speed . he had the power to assume the shape of any four - footed creature , and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy , to run with him . he had a beaten path on which he ran , leading around a large lake , and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning - post was the same . as soon as the mudjee monedo arrived , he eyed this strange warrior whom he had never seen before ; but he dissembled , as usual , and , with a gentle laugh , said to the widow , " did i not tell you that some one was staying with you , for i knew your son was too young to hunt . " the widow excused herself by saying that she did not think it necessary to tell him , inasmuch as he was a manito , and must have known before he asked . the manito was very pleasant with monedowa , and after much other discourse , in a gentle - spoken voice , he invited him to the racing - ground , saying it was a manly amusement , that he would have an excellent chance to meet there with other warriors , and that he should himself be pleased to run with him . monedowa would have excused himself , saying that he knew nothing of running . " why , " replied the mudjee monedo , trembling in every limb as he spoke , " do n't you see how old i look , while you are young and full of life . we must at least run a little to amuse others . " " be it so , then , " replied monedowa . " i will oblige you . i will go in the morning . " pleased with his crafty success , the manito would have now taken his leave , but he was pressed to remain and partake of their hospitality . the meal was immediately prepared . but one dish was used .
