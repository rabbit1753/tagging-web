but , as the enchanter had vanished , he did not waste any more time in thinking , but went to seek the princess , who very soon consented to marry him . but after all , they had not been married very long when the king died , and the queen had nothing left to care for but her little son , who was called hyacinth . the little prince had large blue eyes , the prettiest eyes in the world , and a sweet little mouth , but , alas ! his nose was so enormous that it covered half his face . the queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose , but her ladies assured her that it was not really as large as it looked ; that it was a roman nose , and you had only to open any history to see that every hero has a large nose . the queen , who was devoted to her baby , was pleased with what they told her , and when she looked at hyacinth again , his nose certainly did not seem to her quite so large .
