' you would like to sit down and rest , granny ? ' asked tephany , pushing aside her bundle . ' when the sky is all the roof you have , you rest where you will , ' replied the old woman in trembling tones . ' are you so lonely , then ? ' inquired tephany , full of pity . ' have you no friends who would welcome you into their houses ? ' the old woman shook her head . ' they all died long , long ago , ' she answered , ' and the only friends i have are strangers with kind hearts . ' the girl did not speak for a moment , then held out the small loaf and some bacon intended for her dinner . ' take this , ' she said ; ' to - day at any rate you shall dine well , ' and the old woman took it , gazing at tephany the while . ' those who help others deserve to be helped , ' she answered ; ' your eyes are still red because that miser barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the young man from plover . but cheer up , you are a good girl , and i will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day . ' ' you ? ' cried tephany , stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all about her affairs , but the old woman did not hear her . ' take this long copper pin , ' she went on , ' and every time you stick it in your dress mother bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to go and count her cabbages . as long as the pin is in your dress you will be free , and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case again . ' then , rising , she nodded to tephany and vanished . the girl stood where she was , as still as a stone . if it had not been for the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming . but by that token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her , but a fairy , wise in telling what would happen in the days to come . then suddenly tephany 's eyes fell on the clothes , and to make up for lost time she began to wash them with great vigour .
