long , long ago in japan there lived an old man and his wife . the old man was a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow , but his wife was a regular cross - patch , who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue . she was always grumbling about something from morning to night . the old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness . he was out most of the day at work in the fields , and as he had no child , for his amusement when he came home , he kept a tame sparrow . he loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child .
