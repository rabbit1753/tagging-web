in a moment the cloud was overhead . then the woman took the black tea - cups and threw them at it . seven she threw and seven fell to earth again . and then they could hear the mother in the cloud weeping and scolding , and thereupon the cloud disappeared . they went on for about four hours . then they heard a sound like the noise of silk being torn , and could see a cloud as black as ink , which was rushing up against the wind . " alas , that is my father ! " said the woman . " this is a matter of life and death , for he will not let us be ! because of my love for you i will now have to disobey the holiest of laws ! "
