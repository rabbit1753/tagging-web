once upon a time there was a scholar , who wandered away from his home and went to emmet village . there stood a house which was said to be haunted . yet it was beautifully situated and surrounded by a lovely garden . so the scholar hired it . one evening he was sitting over his books , when several hundred knights suddenly came galloping into the room . they were quite tiny , and their horses were about the size of flies . they had hunting falcons and dogs about as large as gnats and fleas . they came to his bed in the corner of the room , and there they held a great hunt , with bows and arrows : one could see it all quite plainly . they caught a tremendous quantity of birds and game , and all this game was no larger than little grains of rice .
