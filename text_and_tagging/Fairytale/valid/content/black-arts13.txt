" my home is about a hundred miles away from here , in the middle kingdom , and my old mother is still living . the only thing that worries me is that we are so poor . " his wife said : " i will flee with you , and we will find your mother . and waste no regrets on your poverty . " with that she gathered up all the house held in the way of pearls and precious stones , put them in a bag and had her husband tie it around his waist . then she also gave him an umbrella , and in the middle of the night they climbed the wall with the aid of a ladder , and stole away .
