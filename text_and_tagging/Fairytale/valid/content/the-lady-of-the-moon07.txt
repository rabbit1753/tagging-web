she smiled and said to the emperor : " you are a prince of the mundane world of dust . great is your fortune , since you have been able to find your way here ! " and she called for her attendants , who came flying up on white birds , and sang and danced beneath the cassia tree . a pure clear music floated through the air . beside the tree stood a mortar made of white marble , in which a jasper rabbit ground up herbs . that was the dark half of the moon . when the dance had ended , the emperor returned to earth again with the sorcerers . and he had the songs which he had heard on the moon written down and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in his pear - tree garden .
