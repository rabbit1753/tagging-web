now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest , and the old woman stopped at home to wash clothes . the day before , she had made some starch , and now when she came to look for it , it was all gone ; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty . while she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch , down flew the pet sparrow , and bowing her little feathered head - a trick which she had been taught by her master - the pretty bird chirped and said : " it is i who have taken the starch . i thought it was some food put out for me in that basin , and i ate it all . if i have made a mistake i beg you to forgive me ! tweet , tweet , tweet !
