once upon a time there was a king whose wife had died , but he had a daughter who was so good and so beautiful that no one could have been kinder or lovelier than she . the king mourned a long time for the queen , because he had loved her greatly ; but in the course of time he grew weary of his lonely life , and married again with the widow of another king , who also had a daughter ; but one who was just as ugly and evil as the other was handsome and kind . the step - mother and daughter were jealous of the king 's daughter , because she was so handsome ; yet so long as the king was at home , they did not dare harm her , for he was very fond of her . but after a time , the king began to war against another king , and went out to battle . then the queen thought she now could do as she wished , and she let the king 's daughter starve , and beat and pushed her about everywhere . at last everything else was too good for her , and she had to herd the cows . so she went out with the cows , and pastured them in the forest or on the hill . food she had little or none , and she grew pale and thin , and was sad most of the time , and wept . in the herd there was also a great blue bull , who always kept himself neat and clean , and often came to the king 's daughter and let her scratch him .
