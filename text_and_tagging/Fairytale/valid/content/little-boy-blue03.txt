being too proud to allow her son to go to the great house in his ragged clothes , she made him a new suit out of a pretty blue dress she had herself worn in happier times , and when it was finished and the boy dressed in it , he looked as pretty as a prince in a fairy tale . for the bright blue jacket set off his curls to good advantage , and the color just matched the blue of his eyes . his trousers were blue , also , and she took the silver buckles from her own shoes and put them on his , that he might appear the finer . and then she brushed his curls and placed his big straw hat upon them and sent him away with a kiss to see the squire .
