' if we stay here till dawn my father will kill thee , ' she whispered , ' but thou art my husband and i will save thee , as i did before , ' and she cut an apple into nine pieces , and put two pieces at the head of the bed , and two pieces at the foot , and two pieces at the door of the kitchen , and two at the big door , and one outside the house . and when this was done , and she heard the giant snoring , she and the king 's son crept out softly and stole across to the stable , where she led out the blue - grey mare and jumped on its back , and her husband mounted behind her . not long after , the giant awoke . ' are you asleep ? ' asked he . ' not yet , ' answered the apple at the head of the bed , and the giant turned over , and soon was snoring as loudly as before . by and bye he called again . ' are you asleep ? ' ' not yet , ' said the apple at the foot of the bed , and the giant was satisfied . after a while , he called a third time , ' are you asleep ? ' ' not yet , ' replied the apple in the kitchen , but when in a few minutes , he put the question for the fourth time and received an answer from the apple outside the house door , he guessed what had happened , and ran to the room to look for himself . the bed was cold and empty !
