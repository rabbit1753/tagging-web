she did so , and exactly the same fate befell her that had befallen her elder sister . the giant appeared with his creel , and he carried her off , and set her to mind the cow and the house , and to make his porridge and to spin ; and the little yellow - headed peerie folk appeared and asked her for some supper , and she refused to give it to them ; and after that , she could not comb or card her wool , and the giant was angry , and he scolded her , and beat her , and threw her up , half dead , on the joists beside her sister and the hens . then the youngest princess determined to sit out in the kailyard all night , not so much to see what was becoming of the cabbages , as to discover what had happened to her sisters . and when the giant came and carried her off , she was not at all sorry , but very glad , for she was a brave and loving little maiden ; and now she felt that she had a chance of finding out where they were , and whether they were dead or alive .
