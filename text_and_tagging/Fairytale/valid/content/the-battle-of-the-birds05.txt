the king glanced at his wife , who nodded , so he answered : ' let his mother first put him in order , ' and the queen left the hall , and took the cook 's son and dressed him in the prince 's clothes , and led him up to the giant , who held his hand , and together they went out along the road . they had not walked far when the giant stopped and stretched out a stick to the boy . ' if your father had that stick , what would he do with it ? ' asked he . ' if my father had that stick , he would beat the dogs and cats that steal the king 's meat , ' replied the boy . ' thou art the cook 's son ! ' cried the giant . ' go home to thy mother ' ; and turning his back he strode straight to the castle . ' if you seek to trick me this time , the highest stone will soon be the lowest , ' said he , and the king and queen trembled , but they could not bear to give up their boy . ' the butler 's son is the same age as ours , ' whispered the queen ; ' he will not know the difference , ' and she took the child and dressed him in the prince 's clothes , and the giant let him away along the road . before they had gone far he stopped , and held out a stick . ' if thy father had that rod , what would he do with it ? ' asked the giant . ' he would beat the dogs and cats that break the king 's glasses , ' answered the boy .
