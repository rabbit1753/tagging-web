" and when go - swift heard that she pulled up in a moment . all seemed lost , for the farmer and his sons could run very fast indeed , and it seemed to assipattle , sitting motionless on go - swift 's back , that they would very soon make up on him . but , luckily , he remembered the goose 's thrapple , and he pulled it out of his pocket and whistled through it . in an instant the good mare bounded forward , swift as the wind , and was over the hill and out of reach of its pursuers before they had taken ten steps more .
