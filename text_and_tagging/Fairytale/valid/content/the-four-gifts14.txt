next evening , at the moment when denis was accustomed to wait for her in the shadow of the cowhouse , tephany stuck the pin in her dress , and at the very same instant barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and past to the fields , to the plot where the cabbages grew . with a heart as light as her footsteps , the girl ran from the house , and spent her evening happily with denis . and so it was for many days after that . then , at last , tephany began to notice something , and the something made her very sad . at first , denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as quickly as she did , but when he had taught her all the songs he knew , and told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man , he had nothing more to say to her , for he , like a great many other people , was fond of talking himself , but not of listening to any one else . sometimes , indeed , he never came at all , and the next evening he would tell tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business , but though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that he no longer cared for her as he used to do . day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler , and one evening , when she had waited for him in vain , she put her water - pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring . on the path in front of her stood the fairy who had given her the pin , and as she glanced at tephany she gave a little mischievous laugh and said : ' why , my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before , in spite of meeting her lover whenever she pleases . ' ' he has grown tired of me , ' answered tephany in a trembling voice , ' and he makes excuses to stay away . ah ! granny dear , it is not enough to be able to see him , i must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me . he is so clever , you know . help me to be clever too . ' ' is that what you want ? ' cried the old woman . ' well , take this feather and stick it in your hair , and you will be as wise as solomon himself . '
