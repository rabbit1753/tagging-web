" " if you please , sir , " said the boy , bravely , although he was frightened at meeting the squire face to face , " i want you to give me some work to do , so that i can earn money . " " earn money ! " repeated the squire , " why do you wish to earn money ? " " to buy food for my mother , sir . we are very poor , and since she is no longer able to work for me i wish to work for her . " " but what can you do ? " asked the squire ; " you are too small to work in the fields . " " i could earn something , sir , could n't i ? "
