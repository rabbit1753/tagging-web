whoever failed as every one had , yielded up his life at this post ; and although he ran every day , no man was ever known to beat this evil genius ; for whenever he was pressed hard , he changed himself into a fox , wolf , deer , or other swift - footed animal , and was thus able to leave his competitor behind . the whole country was in dread of this same mudjee monedo , and yet the young men were constantly running with him ; for if they refused , he called them cowards , which was a reproach they could not bear . they would rather die than be called cowards . to keep up his sport , the manito made light of these deadly foot - matches , and instead of assuming a braggart air , and going about in a boastful way , with the blood of such as he had overcome , upon his hands , he adopted very pleasing manners , and visited the lodges around the country as any other sweet - tempered and harmless old indian might .
