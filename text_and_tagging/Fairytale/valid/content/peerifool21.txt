but just as she was doing so the door opened once more , and a yellow - haired peerie boy entered . he was exactly like the other peerie folk who had eaten the princess 's porridge , only he was bigger , and he wore a very rich dress of grass - green velvet . he walked boldly into the middle of the kitchen and looked round him . " do you have any work for me to do ? " he asked . " i know grand how to handle wool and turn it into fine thick cloth . " " i have plenty of work for anybody who asks it , " replied the princess ; " but i have no money to pay for it , and there are but few folk in this world who will work without wages . " " all the wages that i ask is that tyou will take the trouble to find out my name , for few folk ken it , and few folk care to know . but if by any chance you can not find it out , then must you pay toll of half of your cloth .
