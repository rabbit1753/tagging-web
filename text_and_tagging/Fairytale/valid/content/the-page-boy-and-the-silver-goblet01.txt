there was once a little page - boy , who was in service in a stately castle . he was a very good - natured little fellow , and did his duties so willingly and well that everybody liked him , from the great earl whom he served every day on bended knee , to the fat old butler whose errands he ran . now the castle stood on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea , and although the walls at that side were very thick , in them there was a little postern door , which opened on to a narrow flight of steps that led down the face of the cliff to the sea shore , so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in the shimmering sea . on the other side of the castle were gardens and pleasure grounds , opening on to a long stretch of heather - covered moorland , which , at last , met a distant range of hills .
