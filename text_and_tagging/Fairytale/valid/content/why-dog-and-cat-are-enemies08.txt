once upon a time there was a man and his wife and they had a ring of gold . it was a lucky ring , and whoever owned it always had enough to live on . but this they did not know , and hence sold the ring for a small sum . but no sooner was the ring gone than they began to grow poorer and poorer , and at last did not know when they would get their next meal . they had a dog and a cat , and these had to go hungry as well . then the two animals took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune . at length the dog hit upon an idea . then her master said to his wife : " what a good creature the cat is ! we will always give her enough to eat and care for her as though she were our own child ! " but when the dog came home they beat him and scolded him , because he had not helped to bring home the ring again . and the cat sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word . then the dog grew angry at the cat , because she had robbed him of his reward , and when he saw her he chased her and tried to seize her . and ever since that day cat and dog are enemies .
