although game was scarce in the neighborhood of the widow 's lodge , monedowa returned at evening , in his character of a hunter , with two deer . this was his daily practice , and the widow 's family never more lacked for food . it was noticed , however , that monedowa himself ate but little , and that of a peculiar kind of meat , flavored with berries , which , with other circumstances , convinced them that he was not as the indian people around him . in a few days his mother - in - law told him that the manito would come to pay them a visit , to see how the young man , her son , prospered . monedowa answered that he should on that day be absent . when the time arrived , he flew upon a tall tree , overlooking the lodge , and took his station there as the wicked manito passed in . the mudjee monedo cast sharp glances at the scaffolds so well laden with meat , and as soon as he had entered , he said , " why , who is it that is furnishing you with meat so plentifully ? " " no one , " she answered , " but my son ; he is just beginning to kill deer . " " no , no , " he retorted ; " some one is living with you . " " kaween , no indeed , " replied the widow ; " you are only making sport of my hapless condition . who do you think would come and trouble themselves about me ? " " very well , " answered the manito , " i will go ; but on such a day i will again visit you , and see who it is that furnishes the meat , and whether it is your son or not . "
