' lay down thy weariness , ' said she , and the king 's son , thinking he could only die once , sank on the floor at her bidding , and fell sound asleep . when he woke the girl had disappeared , and the byre was so clean that a golden apple could roll from end to end of it . he jumped up in surprise , and at that moment in came the giant . ' hast thou cleaned the byre , king 's son ? ' asked he . ' i have cleaned it , ' answered he . ' well , since thou wert so active to - day , to - morrow thou wilt thatch this byre with a feather from every different bird , or else thy blood shall pay for it , ' and he went out . before the sun was up , the youth took his bow and his quiver and set off to kill the birds . off to the moor he went , but never a bird was to be seen that day . at last he got so tired with running to and fro that he gave up heart . ' there is but one death i can die , ' thought he . then at midday came the giant 's daughter . ' thou art tired , king 's son ? ' asked she . ' i am , ' answered he ; ' all these hours have i wandered , and there fell but these two blackbirds , both of one colour . ' ' lay down thy weariness on the grass , ' said she , and he did as she bade him , and fell fast asleep .
