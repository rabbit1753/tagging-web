the cows and sheep were quietly browsing near him , and he watched them earnestly for a time , listening to the singing of the birds , and the gentle tinkling of the bells upon the wethers , and the far - away songs of the reapers that the breeze brought to his ears . and before he knew it the blue eyes had closed fast , and the golden head lay back upon the hay , and little boy blue was fast asleep and dreaming that his mother was well again and had come to the stile to meet him . the sheep strayed near the edge of the meadow and paused , waiting for the warning sound of the horn . and the breeze carried the fragrance of the growing corn to the nostrils of the browsing cows and tempted them nearer and nearer to the forbidden feast . but the silver horn was silent , and before long the cows were feeding upon the squire 's pet cornfield and the sheep were enjoying themselves amidst the juicy grasses of the meadows .
