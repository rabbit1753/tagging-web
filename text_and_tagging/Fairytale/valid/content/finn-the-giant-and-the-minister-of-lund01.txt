there stands in the university town of schonen , the town of lund , the seat of the first archbishopric in all scandinavia , a stately romanic minster , with a large , handsome crypt beneath the choir . the opinion is universal that the minster will never be altogether finished , but that something will always be lacking about the structure . the reason is said to be as follows : when st . lawrence came to lund to preach the gospel , he wanted to build a church ; but did not know how he was to obtain the means to do so .
