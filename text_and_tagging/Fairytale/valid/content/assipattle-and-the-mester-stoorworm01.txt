in far bygone days , in the north , there lived a well - to - do farmer , who had seven sons and one daughter . and the youngest of these seven sons bore a very curious name ; for men called him assipattle , which means , " he who grovels among the ashes . " perhaps assipattle deserved his name , for he was rather a lazy boy , who never did any work on the farm as his brothers did , but ran about the doors with ragged clothes and unkempt hair , and whose mind was ever filled with wondrous stories of trolls and giants , elves and goblins . when the sun was hot in the long summer afternoons , when the bees droned drowsily and even the tiny insects seemed almost asleep , the boy was content to throw himself down on the ash - heap amongst the ashes , and lie there , lazily letting them run through his fingers , as one might play with sand on the sea - shore , basking in the sunshine and telling stories to himself .
