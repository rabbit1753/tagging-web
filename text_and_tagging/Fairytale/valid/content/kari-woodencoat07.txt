in the evening , while the rest were asleep , the king 's daughter crept down to the bull in the stable . he took her on his back , and ran off as quickly as ever he could . and when the people rose the following morning , and wanted to slaughter the bull , he was gone ; and when the king rose and asked for his daughter , she was gone as well . the king sent out messengers on all sides , and had the church - bells rung for her , but no one had seen anything of her .
