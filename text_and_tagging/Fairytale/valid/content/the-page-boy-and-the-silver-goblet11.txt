presently the fairies noticed him , and , instead of being angry at his boldness in entering their abode , as he expected that they would be , they seemed very pleased to see him , and invited him to a seat at the table . but by and by they grew rude and insolent , and jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , telling him that they saw everything that went on at the castle , and making fun of the old butler , whom the page loved with all his heart . and they laughed at the food he ate , saying that it was only fit for animals ; and when any fresh dainty was set on the table by the scarlet - clad pages , they would push the dish across to him , saying : " taste it , for you will not have the chance of tasting such things at the castle . " at last he could stand their teasing remarks no longer ; besides , he knew that if he wanted to secure the cup he must lose no time in doing so . so he suddenly stood up , and grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand . " i 'll drink to you all in water , " he cried , and instantly the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
