" the court is coming past in a moment , " said the cat , " and if then you do not at once say that they belong to ebe , i will scratch out your eyes , and drive you over rock and precipice ! " said the cat , and spat and arched her back , and showed her teeth . then the shepherds were so frightened that they at once promised to do as the cat had ordered . " but to whom do all these sheep belong ? " asked the king , when he came by with the court somewhat later . " they are every bit as handsome as my own ! " " they belong to ebe , " said the shepherds . then the cat and ebe wandered on for a while , and came to a dense forest slope . there they met folk who were tending goats . the goats skipped and leaped about everywhere , and gave such fine milk that better could no where be found . " to whom do the goats belong ? " asked the cat . " to helge - hal in the blue hill , " said the herdsmen . then the cat again went through her ferocious preparations , and the herdsmen were so frightened that they did not dare oppose her wishes . " now who in the world can be the owner of so many goats ? " asked the king . " i myself have none finer ! " " they belong to ebe , " said the herdsmen .
