but the spring never came , nor the summer.the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden , but to the giant 's garden she gave none . " he is too selfish , " she said . so it was always winter there , and the north wind , and the hail , and the frost , and the snow danced about through the trees . one morning the giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music . it sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the king 's musicians passing by . it was really only a little linnet singing outside his window , but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world . then the hail stopped dancing over his head , and the north wind ceased roaring , and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement . " i believe the spring has come at last , " said the giant ; and he jumped out of bed and looked out . what did he see ? he saw a most wonderful sight . through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in , and they were sitting in the branches of the trees . in every tree that he could see there was a little child . and the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms , and were waving their arms gently above the children 's heads . the birds were flying about and twittering with delight , and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing . it was a lovely scene , only in one corner it was still winter . it was the farthest corner of the garden , and in it was standing a little boy . he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree , and he was wandering all round it , crying bitterly . the poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow , and the north wind was blowing and roaring above it .
