" i am to deliver a kind greeting from ebe , and ask whether my lord king might not care to have this bear for a general or royal counselor , " said the cat . the king was more than pleased to secure such a creature for his nearest adviser , who could doubt it . " tell him that i am much obliged , but that i do not at all know how to show my appreciation , " said the king . " well , he would like to marry your youngest daughter ! " said the cat . " yes , but that is asking a good deal , " said the king . " he really ought to pay me a visit . " " ebe does not enter such plain houses , " said the cat . " has he a handsomer castle than this ? " asked the king . " handsomer ? why , your castle seems like the shabbiest hut in comparison with his ! " was the cat 's reply .
