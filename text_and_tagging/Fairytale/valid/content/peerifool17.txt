" we be hungry , we be hungry , " they cried . " spare a little porridge for the peerie folk . " " with all my heart , " replied the good - natured princess . " if you can find dishes little enough for you to sup out of , i will fill them for you . but , it seems to me , if i were to give you all porringers , you would smother yourselves among the porridge .
