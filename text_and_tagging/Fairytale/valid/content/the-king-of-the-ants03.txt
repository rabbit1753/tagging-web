the scholar gradually accustomed himself to the sight . although the men were so very small he could distinguish everything quite clearly . before long , a bright colored banner appeared . behind it rode a personage wearing a scarlet hat and garments of purple . he was surrounded by an escort of several thousands . before him went runners with whips and rods to clear the way . then a man wearing an iron helmet and with a golden ax in his hand cried out in a loud voice : " his highness is graciously pleased to look at the fish in the purple lake ! " whereupon the one who wore the scarlet hat got down from his horse , and , followed by a retinue of several hundred men , approached the saucer which the scholar used for his writing - ink . tents were put up on the edge of the saucer and a banquet was prepared . a great number of guests sat down to the table . musicians and dancers stood ready . there was a bright confusion of mingled garments of purple and scarlet , crimson and green . pipes and flutes , fiddles and cymbals sounded , and the dancers moved in the dance . the music was very faint , and yet its melodies could be clearly distinguished . all that was said , too , the table - talk and orders , questions and calls , could be quite distinctly heard .
