he was a very selfish giant . the poor children had now nowhere to play . they tried to play on the road , but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones , and they did not like it . they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over , and talk about the beautiful garden inside . " how happy we were there , " they said to each other . then the spring came , and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds . only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter . the birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children , and the trees forgot to blossom . once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass , but when it saw the notice - board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again , and went off to sleep . the only people who were pleased were the snow and the frost .
