' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl , ' put thy hand into the ear of the mare , and whatever thou findest there , throw it behind thee . ' and in the mare 's ear there was a twig of sloe tree , and as he threw it behind him there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood so thick that scarce a weasel could go through it . and the giant , who was striding headlong forwards , got caught in it , and it pulled his hair and beard . ' this is one of my daughter 's tricks , ' he said to himself , ' but if i had my big axe and my wood - knife , i would not be long making a way through this , ' and off he went home and brought back the axe and the wood - knife . it took him but a short time to cut a road through the blackthorn , and then he laid the axe and the knife under a tree . ' i will leave them there till i return , ' he murmured to himself , but a hoodie crow , which was sitting on a branch above , heard him . ' if thou leavest them , ' said the hoodie , ' we will steal them . ' ' you will , ' answered the giant , ' and i must take them home . ' so he took them home , and started afresh on his journey . ' my father 's breath is burning my back , ' cried the girl at midday . ' put thy finger in the mare 's ear and throw behind thee whatever thou findest in it , ' and the king 's son found a splinter of grey stone , and threw it behind him , and in a twinkling twenty miles of solid rock lay between them and the giant .
