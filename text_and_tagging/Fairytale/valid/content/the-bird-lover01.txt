in a region of country where the forest and the prairie strived which should be the most beautiful - the open plain , with its free sunshine and winds and flowers , or the close wood , with its delicious twilight - walks and enamored haunts - there lived a wicked manito in the disguise of an old indian . although the country furnished an abundance of game , and whatever else a good heart could wish for , it was the study of this wicked genius to destroy such as fell into his hands . he made use of all his arts to decoy men into his power , for the purpose of killing them . the country had been once thickly peopled , but this mudjee monedo had so thinned it by his cruel practices , that he now lived almost solitary in the wilderness . the secret of his success lay in his great speed . he had the power to assume the shape of any four - footed creature , and it was his custom to challenge such as he sought to destroy , to run with him . he had a beaten path on which he ran , leading around a large lake , and he always ran around this circle so that the starting and the winning - post was the same .
