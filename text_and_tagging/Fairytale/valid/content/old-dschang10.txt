they crossed a hill . at the foot of the hill flowed a brook , and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill . gradually the landscape changed . from the top of the hill could be seen a valley , level in the middle , surrounded by abrupt crags and shaded by green trees , among which houses and towers peeped forth . this was the country house of old dschang . before the village flowed a deep brook full of clear , blue water . they passed over a stone bridge and reached the gate . here flowers and trees grew in luxurious profusion , and peacocks and cranes flew about . from the distance could be heard the sound of flutes and of stringed instruments . crystal - clear tones rose to the clouds . a messenger in a purple robe received the guest at the gate and led him into a hall of surpassing splendor . strange fragrances filled the air , and there was a ringing of little bells of pearl . two maid - servants came forth to greet him , followed by two rows of beautiful girls in a long processional . after them a man in a flowing turban , clad in scarlet silk , with red slippers , came floating along . the guest saluted him . he was serious and dignified , and at the same time seemed youthfully fresh . at first we 's son did not recognize him , but when he looked more closely , why it was old dschang ! the latter said with a smile : " i am pleased that the long road to travel has not prevented your coming . your sister is just combing her hair . she will welcome you in a moment . " then he had him sit down and drink tea .
