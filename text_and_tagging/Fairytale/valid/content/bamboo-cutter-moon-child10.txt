at last , however , most of the men , seeing how hopeless their quest was , lost heart and hope both , and returned to their homes . all except five knights , whose ardor and determination , instead of waning , seemed to wax greater with obstacles . these five men even went without their meals , and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them , so that they might always stand outside the dwelling . they stood there in all weathers , in sunshine and in rain . sometimes they wrote letters to the princess , but no answer was vouchsafed to them . then when letters failed to draw any reply , they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love which kept them from sleep , from food , from rest , and even from their homes . still princes moonlight gave no sign of having received their verses .
