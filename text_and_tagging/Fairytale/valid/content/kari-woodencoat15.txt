the bull told the king 's daughter that in no case was she to touch anything , since a troll with nine heads lived here , to whom the forest belonged . and he was much larger and stronger than the two others together , and he did not believe he could hold his own against him . yes , said she , she would be sure to pay attention and positively would not touch a thing . but when they entered the forest , it was even thicker than the silver forest , and the further they went the worse it became . the forest grew thicker and denser , and at last it seemed as though it would be impossible to push on at all . she was much afraid of tearing off anything , and wound and twisted and bent herself in every direction , in order to avoid the branches , and thrust them aside with her hands . but each moment they struck her in the face , so that she could not see where she was reaching , and before she had a chance to think , she held a golden apple in her hand . then she was terribly frightened , and began to cry , and wanted to throw it away . but the bull told her to keep it , and hide it carefully , and consoled her as best he could . yet he thought that the battle would be a hard one , and was in doubt as to whether it would end well .
