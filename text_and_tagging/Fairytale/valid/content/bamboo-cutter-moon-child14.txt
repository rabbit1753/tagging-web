" i found you , " answered the old man , " many years ago , when you were a little creature three inches high , in the midst of a great white light . the light streamed from the bamboo in which you were hid and led me to you . so i have always thought that you were more than mortal woman . while i am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so , but some day i shall cease to be and who will take care of you then ? therefore i pray you to meet these five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them ! " then the princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report made her out to be , and that even if she consented to marry any one of them , not really knowing her before , his heart might change afterwards . so as she did not feel sure of them , even though her father told her they were worthy knights , she did not feel it wise to see them .
