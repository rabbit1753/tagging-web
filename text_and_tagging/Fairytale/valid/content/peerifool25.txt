just as the gloaming was beginning to fall a knock came at the door , and , when she opened it , she found an old woman standing outside , who begged for a night 's lodging . now , as i have told you , the princess was very kind - hearted , and she would fain have granted the poor old dame 's request , but she dared not , for she did not know what the giant would say . so she told the old woman that she could not take her in for the night , as she was only a servant , and not the mistress of the house ; but she made her sit down on a bench beside the door , and brought her out some bread and milk , and gave her some water to bathe her poor , tired feet . she was so bonnie , and gentle , and kind , and she looked so sorry when she told her that she would need to turn her away , that the old woman gave her her blessing , and told her not to vex herself , as it was a fine , dry night , and now that she had had a meal she could easily sit down somewhere and sleep in the shelter of the outhouses .
