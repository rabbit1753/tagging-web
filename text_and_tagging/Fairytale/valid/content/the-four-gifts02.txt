well , this being the sort of person barbaik was , it is easy to guess at her anger when one day she found tephany talking outside the cowhouse to young denis , who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of plover . seizing her niece by the arm , she pulled her sharply away , exclaiming : ' are you not ashamed , girl , to waste your time over a man who is as poor as a rat , when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy you rings of silver , if you would let them ? ' ' denis is a good workman , as you know very well , ' answered tephany , red with anger , ' and he puts by money too , and soon he will be able to take a farm for himself . ' ' nonsense , ' cried barbaik , ' he will never save enough for a farm till he is a hundred . i would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man who carries his whole fortune on his back . ' ' what does fortune matter when one is young and strong ? ' asked tephany , but her aunt , amazed at such words , would hardly let her finish . ' what does fortune matter ? ' repeated barbaik , in a shocked voice . ' is it possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money ? if this is what you learn from denis , i forbid you to speak to him , and i will have him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again . now go and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry .
