at last they once more went slowly on their way ; for the bull said they still had a little further to go , and they went over many great hills and through thick forests . after a time they came to a rock . " do you see anything ? " asked the bull . " no , i see only the sky and the rock , " said the king 's daughter . but when they went on up the hills were more level , so that they had a broader outlook . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , i see a small castle , far , far in the distance , " said the princess . " and yet it is not so small , " said the bull . at length they came to a great mountain with a steep , rocky face . " do you see something now ? " asked the bull . " yes , now i see the castle close by , and it is much , much larger , " said the king 's daughter . " that is where you must go ! " said the bull .
