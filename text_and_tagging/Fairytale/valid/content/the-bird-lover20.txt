as if he had but waited to be spoken to , the bird left his branch , and alighting upon the bank , smiled on minda , and , shaking his shining plumage , answered : " i am bound in this condition until a maiden shall accept me in marriage . i have wandered these groves and sung to many and many of the indian girls , but none ever heeded my voice till you . will you be mine ? " he added , and poured forth a flood of melody which sparkled and spread itself with its sweet murmurs over all the scene , and fairly entranced the young minda , who sat silent , as if she feared to break the charm by speech . the bird , approaching nearer , asked her , if she loved him , to get her mother 's consent to their marriage . " i shall be free then , " said the bird , " and you shall know me as i am . " minda lingered , and listened to the sweet voice of the bird in its own forest notes , or filling each pause with gentle human discourse ; questioning her as to her home , her family , and the little incidents of her daily life . she returned to the lodge later than usual , but she was too timid to speak to her mother of that which the bird had charged her . she returned again and again to the fragrant haunt in the wood ; and everyday she listened to the song and the discourse of her bird admirer with more pleasure , and he every day besought her to speak to her mother of the marriage . this she could not , however , muster heart and courage to do .
