the building of the church made rapid progress , and ere long it was nearly finished . st . lawrence thought ruefully about his prospects , for he did not know the giant 's name ; yet at the same time he did not relish losing his eyes . and it happened that while he was walking without the town , much concerned about the outcome of the affair , he grew weary , and sat down on a hill to rest . as he sat there he heard a child crying within the hill , and a woman 's voice began to sing : " sleep , sleep , my baby dear , to - morrow your father , finn , will be here ; then sun and moon you shall have from the skies to play with , or else st . lawrence 's eyes .
