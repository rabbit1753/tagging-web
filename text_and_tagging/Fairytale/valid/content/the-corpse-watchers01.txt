there was once a poor woman that had three daughters , and one day the eldest said , " mother , bake my cake and kill my cock till i go seek my fortune . " so she did , and when all was ready , says her mother to her , " which will you have -- half of these with my blessing , or the whole with my curse ? " " curse or no curse , " says she , " the whole is little enough . " so away she set , and if the mother did n't give her her curse , she did n't give her her blessing . she walked , and she walked , till she was tired and hungry , and then she sat down to take her dinner . while she was eating it a poor woman came up , and asked for a bit . " the dickens a bit you 'll get from me , " says she ; " it 's all too little for myself . " and the poor woman walked away very sorrowful . at nightfall she got lodging at a farmer 's , and the woman of the house told her that she 'd give her a spadeful of gold and a shovelful of silver if she 'd only sit up and watch her son 's corpse that was waking in the next room . she said she 'd do that , and so , when the family were in their bed , she sat by the fire , and cast an eye from time to time on the corpse that was lying under the table . all at once the dead man got up in his shroud , and stood before her , and said , " all alone , fair maid ? " she gave him no answer ; when he had said it the third time he struck her with a switch , and she became a grey flag .
