" asked the youth . yes , indeed she would . then he gave her one of the magic apples , and her horns were only half as large as before . " but i can not do more until i have my cap , and my table - cloth , and my purse back again , " said he . so she went and brought him the things . then he gave her still another magic apple , and now the horns were no more than tiny hornlets . " but now i can not go on until you have sworn that you will be true to me , " said he . and she swore that she would . and after she had eaten the third apple , her forehead was quite smooth again , and she was even more beautiful than in days gone by .
