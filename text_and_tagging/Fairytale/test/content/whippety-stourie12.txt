now in this fir wood there was an old quarry hole , in the bottom of which was a bonnie spring well , the water of which was always sweet and pure . the young widow was walking near this quarry hole , when , to her astonishment , she heard the whirr of a spinning - wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a song . at first she could not think where the sound came from ; then , remembering the quarry , she laid down her child at a tree root , and crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the hole and peeped over . she could hardly believe her eyes ! for there , far below her , at the bottom of the quarry , beside the spring well , sat the cruel fairy , dressed in her green frock and tall felt hat , spinning away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning - wheel . and what should she be singing but-- " little kens our guid dame at hame , whippety - stourie is my name .
