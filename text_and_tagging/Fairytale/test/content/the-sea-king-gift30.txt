his wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea - king . next morning thirty cows stood on the shore , all finding food for themselves . ' know'st thou , good man , that we are far too cramped on this wretched rock , and where am i to find room for so many cows ? ' ' there is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea . ' ' rubbish ! ' said his wife . ' who can pump out the sea ? ' ' try with thy new steamer , there is a pump in it . ' maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her , but still her mind was set upon the same subject . ' i never could pump the sea out , ' thought she , ' but perhaps i might fill it up , if i were to make a big dam . i might heap up sand and stones , and make our island as big again . '
