it happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace , that she said to the cook , ' can i go upstairs for a little bit and look on ? i will stand outside the doors . ' the cook replied , ' yes , you can go up , but in half - an - hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes . ' then she took her little oil - lamp , and went into her little room , drew off her fur cloak , and washed off the soot from her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth , and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud . then she opened the nut , and took out the dress as golden as the sun . and when she had done this , she went up to the feast , and everyone stepped out of her way , for nobody knew her , and they thought she must be a king 's daughter . but the king came towards her and gave her his hand , and danced with her , thinking to himself , ' my eyes have never beheld anyone so fair ! ' when the dance was ended , she curtseyed to him , and when the king looked round she had disappeared , no one knew whither . the guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned , but no one had seen her .
