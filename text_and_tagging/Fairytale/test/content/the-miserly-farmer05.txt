once upon a time there was a farmer who had carted pears to market . since they were very sweet and fragrant , he hoped to get a good price for them . a bonze with a torn cap and tattered robe stepped up to his cart and asked for one . the farmer repulsed him , but the bonze did not go . then the farmer grew angry and began to call him names . the bonze said : " you have pears by the hundred in your cart . i only ask for one . surely that does you no great injury . why suddenly grow so angry about it ? "
