there were formerly a king and a queen , who were so sorry that they had no children ; so sorry that it can not be expressed . they went to all the waters in the world ; vows , pilgrimages , all ways were tried , and all to no purpose . at last , however , the queen had a daughter . there was a very fine christening ; and the princess had for her god - mothers all the fairies they could find in the whole kingdom ( they found seven ) , that every one of them might give her a gift , as was the custom of fairies in those days . by this means the princess had all the perfections imaginable .
