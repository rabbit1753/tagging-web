' what would you do with a cow ? ' asked matte . ' she could not swim so far , and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here ; and even if we had her , we have nothing to feed her on . ' ' we have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass , ' rejoined maie . ' yes , of course , ' laughed matte , ' and we have also three plants of garlic . garlic would be fine feeding for her . ' ' every cow likes salt herring , ' rejoined his wife . ' even prince is fond of fish . ' ' that may be , ' said her husband . ' methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring . all very well for prince , who fights with the gulls over the last morsel . put the cow out of your head , mother , we are very well off as we are .
