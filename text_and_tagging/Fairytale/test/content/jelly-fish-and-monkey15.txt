the monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious , and urged the jelly fish to tell him for what his liver was wanted , and ended up by appealing to his hearer 's feelings by saying that he was very troubled at what he had been told . then the jelly fish , seeing how anxious the monkey looked , was sorry for him , and told him everything . how the dragon queen had fallen ill , and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her , and how the dragon king had sent him to find one . " now i have done as i was told , and as soon as we arrive at the palace the doctor will want your liver , so i feel sorry for you ! " said the silly jelly fish . the poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this , and very angry at the trick played upon him . he trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him . but the monkey was a clever animal , and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign of the fear he felt , so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape .
