' all hail , fisher 's son ! ' said she . ' i know what you are seeking ; enter in and rest and eat , and to - morrow i will give you what help i can , and send you on your way . ' gladly did ian the fisher 's son accept her offer , and all that day he rested , and the woman gave him ointment to put on his feet , which healed his sores . at daybreak he got up , ready to be gone , and the woman bade him farewell , saying : ' i have a sister who dwells on the road which you must travel . it is a long road , and it would take you a year and a day to reach it , but put on these old brown shoes with holes all over them , and you will be there before you know it . then shake them off , and turn their toes to the known , and their heels to the unknown , and they will come home of themselves . '
