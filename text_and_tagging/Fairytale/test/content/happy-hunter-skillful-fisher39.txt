without waiting for the king 's order the cuttlefish had already started for the tai 's dwelling , and he now returned , bringing the tai with him . he led him before the king . the tai sat there looking frightened and ill . he certainly was in pain , for his usually red face was pale , and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size . " answer , o tai ! " cried the sea king , " why did you not come in answer to my summons today ? " " i have been ill since yesterday , " answered the tai ; " that is why i could not come . " " do n't say another word ! " cried out ryn jin angrily . " your illness is the punishment of the gods for stealing the mikoto 's hook . " " it is only too true ! " said the tai ; " the hook is still in my throat , and all my efforts to get it out have been useless . i ca n't eat , and i can scarcely breathe , and each moment i feel that it will choke me , and sometimes it gives me great pain . i had no intention of stealing the mikoto 's hook . i heedlessly snapped at the bait which i saw in the water , and the hook came off and stuck in my throat . so i hope you will pardon me .
