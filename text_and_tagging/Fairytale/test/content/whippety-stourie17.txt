" oh , sweet madam mistress , " she cried , " spare me my bairn , and take , and thou wilt , the pig instead . " " we have no need of bacon where i come from , " answered the fairy coldly ; " so give me the laddie and let me begone -- i have no time to waste in this wise . " " oh , dear lady mine , " pleaded the goodwife , " if thou wilt not have the pig , wilt thou not spare my poor bairn and take me myself ? " the fairy stepped back a little , as if in astonishment . " art thou mad , woman , " she cried contemptuously , " that thou proposest such a thing ? who in all the world would care to take a plain - looking , red - eyed , dowdy wife like thee with them ? " now the young mistress of kittlerumpit knew that she was no beauty , and the knowledge had never vexed her ; but something in the fairy 's tone made her feel so angry that she could contain herself no longer . " in troth , fair madam , i might have had the wit to know that the like of me is not fit to tie the shoe - string of the high and mighty princess , whippety - stourie ! " if there had been a charge of gunpowder buried in the ground , and if it had suddenly exploded beneath her feet , the wicked fairy could not have jumped higher into air . and when she came down again she simply turned round and ran down the brae , shrieking with rage and disappointment , for all the world , as an old book says , " like an owl chased by witches .
