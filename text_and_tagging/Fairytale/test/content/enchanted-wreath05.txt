' you poor little things , ' said the girl , stroking them . ' why do you sit there and get wet ? go and fly home to your nest , it will be much warmer than this ; but first eat this bread , which i saved from my dinner , and perhaps you will feel happier . it is my father 's axe you are sitting on , and i must take it back as fast as i can , or i shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother . ' she then crumbled the bread on the ground , and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it . ' good - bye , ' she said , picking up the axe , and went her way homewards . by the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better , and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree .
