there was once a rich peasant who had two sons , named john nicholas and lucky andrew . the oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail . he was a most unpleasant customer to deal with , and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the northland are , as a rule , though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities . the other , lucky andrew , was wild and high spirited , but always good natured , and no matter how badly off he might be , he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star . when the eagle , in order to defend his nest , belabored his head and face till the blood ran , he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star , if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet . did his boat capsize , which occasionally happened , and did they discover him hanging to it , quite overcome with the water , cold and exertion , and asked him how he felt , he would reply : " o , quite well . i have been saved . i surely am in luck ! " but his brother complained of being weary , and at length they decided to remain there for the night . when andrew awoke he found himself alone ; and he saw neither brother nor boat , until he came to the highest point of the island . then he discovered him far out , darting for land like a sea - gull . andrew did not understand the whole affair . there were still provisions there , as well as a dish of curd , his gun and various other things . so andrew wasted but little time in thought . " he will come back this evening , " said he . " only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat . " but in the evening there was no brother to be seen , and andrew waited day by day , and week by week ; until at last , he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself , and not have to divide it . and such was the case , for when john nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip , he had capsized the boat , and declared that lucky andrew had been drowned .
