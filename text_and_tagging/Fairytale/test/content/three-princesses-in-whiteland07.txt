but when he came out in the morning , the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles . the third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips , and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted . then the troll took him and flung him against the wall , and as he did so the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth , and he was at once sound and whole again . then he did not delay , but grasped the sword , killed the troll , and when he came out in the morning , the princesses were entirely out of the ground . so he chose the youngest of them to be his queen , and lived long with her in peace and happiness . but at last he was minded to travel home , and see how his parents fared . this did not suit his queen ; but since he wanted to go so badly , and finally was on the point of departure , she said to him : " one thing you must promise me , that you will only do what your father tells you to do , but not what your mother tells you to do . " and this he promised . then she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it . so he wished himself home , and his parents could not get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become . when he had been home a few days , his mother wanted him to go up to the castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be . his father said : " no , he had better not do that , for we will have to do without him in the meantime . " but there was no help for it , the mother begged and pleaded until he went . when he got there he was more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the other king . this did not suit the latter , and he said : " you can see what my queen looks like , but i can not see yours ; and i do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine . " " god grant she were standing here , then you would see soon enough ! " said the young king , and there she stood that very minute . but she was very sad , and said to him : " why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father ? now i must go straight home , and you have used up both of your wishes . " with that she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair , and wished herself home .
