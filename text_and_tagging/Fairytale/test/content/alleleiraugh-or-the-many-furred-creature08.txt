when the dance was ended , the king had his soup brought to him and ate it , and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life . but when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there , and he could not imagine how it got in . then he commanded the cook to be brought before him . the cook was terrified when he heard the command , and said to the many - furred creature , ' you must have let a hair fall into the soup , and if you have you deserve a good beating ! ' when he came before the king , the king asked who had cooked the soup . the cook answered , ' i cooked it . ' but the king said , ' that 's not true , for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked . ' then the cook said , ' i must confess ; i did not cook the soup ; the many - furred creature did . ' ' let her be brought before me , ' said the king .
