' i will give them , ' answered the man , and he took the horse , and the youth took the gun and the dog and the falcon , and went home with them . but when his mother heard what he had done she was very angry , and beat him with a stick which she had in her hand . ' that will teach you to sell my property , ' said she , when her arm was quite tired , but ian her son answered her nothing , and went off to his bed , for he was very sore . that night he rose softly , and left the house carrying the gun with him . ' i will not stay here to be beaten , ' thought he , and he walked and he walked and he walked , till it was day again , and he was hungry and looked about him to see if he could get anything to eat . not very far off was a farm - house , so he went there , and knocked at the door , and the farmer and his wife begged him to come in , and share their breakfast .
