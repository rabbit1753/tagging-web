at last they returned to the palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon . her scales were of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles , her eyes threw out glances of fire , and she was dressed in gorgeous robes . all the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned them . the king fell in love with her at once , and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great splendor . every living thing in the sea , from the great whales down to the little shrimps , came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them a long and prosperous life . never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities in the fish - world before . the train of bearers who carried the bride 's possessions to her new home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other . each fish carried a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes , gleaming blue and pink and silver ; and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white and green fire , for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event .
