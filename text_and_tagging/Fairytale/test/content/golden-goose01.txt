there was once a man who had three sons . the youngest of them was called dullhead , and was sneered and jeered at and snubbed on every possible opportunity . one day it happened that the eldest son wished to go into the forest to cut wood , and before he started his mother gave him a fine rich cake and a bottle of wine , so that he might be sure not to suffer from hunger or thirst . when he reached the forest he met a little old grey man who wished him ' good - morning , ' and said : ' do give me a piece of that cake you have got in your pocket , and let me have a draught of your wine - i am so hungry and thirsty .
