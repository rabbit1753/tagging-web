' so four of them killed the fisher 's son and left him , and then went to bed . by sunrise they were all out of the house , for they had far to go . and when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof , to where the dead man lay , and she shook her head over him , and wax fell from her ear , and he jumped up as well as ever .
