' why , it is larger and richer than i thought , ' cried she , turning towards the wolf , who was leaning over the wall of the well . ' then be quick and bring it up , ' commanded the wolf . ' how can i , when it weighs more than i do ? ' asked the fox . ' if it is so heavy bring it in two bits , of course , ' said he . ' but i have no knife , ' answered the fox . ' you will have to come down yourself , and we will carry it up between us . ' ' and how am i to come down ? ' inquired the wolf . ' oh , you are really very stupid ! get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head . ' the wolf looked up , and saw the bucket hanging there , and with some difficulty he climbed into it . as he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk , and the other bucket , in which the fox was seated , came to the surface .
