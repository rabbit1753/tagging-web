" if there be one thing i am fond of , it is a glass of ale and a well - toasted cake , " he cried . " so come inside here , and welcome to you . " but as soon as the little bannock heard of the ale , it turned and ran out of the smithy as fast as it could , and the disappointed smith picked up his hammer and ran after it . and when he saw that he could not catch it , he flung his heavy hammer at it , in the hope of knocking it down , but , luckily for the little cake , he missed his aim . after this the bannock came to a farmhouse , with a great stack of peats standing at the back of it . in it went , and ran to the fireside . in this house the master had all the lint spread out on the floor , and was cloving it with an iron rod , while the mistress was heckling what he had already cloven .
