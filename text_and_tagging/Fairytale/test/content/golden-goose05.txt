then dullhead fell to at once to hew down the tree , and when it fell he found amongst its roots a goose , whose feathers were all of pure gold . he lifted it out , carried it off , and took it with him to an inn where he meant to spend the night . now the landlord of the inn had three daughters , and when they saw the goose they were filled with curiosity as to what this wonderful bird could be , and each longed to have one of its golden feathers . the eldest thought to herself : ' no doubt i shall soon find a good opportunity to pluck out one of its feathers , ' and the first time dullhead happened to leave the room she caught hold of the goose by its wing . but , lo and behold ! her fingers seemed to stick fast to the goose , and she could not take her hand away .
