long , long ago , in old japan , the kingdom of the sea was governed by a wonderful king . he was called rin jin , or the dragon king of the sea . his power was immense , for he was the ruler of all sea creatures both great and small , and in his keeping were the jewels of the ebb and flow of the tide . the jewel of the ebbing tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to recede from the land , and the jewel of the flowing tide made the waves to rise mountains high and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave .
