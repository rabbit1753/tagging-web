' sir , ' she said , ' i know all that has happened to you , and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life . but there is none that can answer that question save only i myself , if you will promise to do all i ask . ' at her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled off him . ' oh , save me , and i will do anything ! ' he cried . ' it is so hard to leave the world and go out into the darkness . ' ' you will not need to do that , ' answered the old woman , ' you have only got to marry me , and you will soon be free . ' ' marry you ? ' exclaimed he , ' but -- but -- i am not yet twenty , and you --why , you must be a hundred at least ! oh , no , it is quite impossible . ' he spoke without thinking , but the flash of anger which darted from her eyes made him feel uncomfortable . however , all she said was : ' as you like ; since you reject me , let the crows have you , ' and hurried away down the street .
