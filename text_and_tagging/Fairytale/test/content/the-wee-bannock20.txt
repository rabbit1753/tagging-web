but the bannock did not wait until the door was sneckit . it turned and ran as fast as it could , and the shepherd and his wife and all the bairns ran after it , with their spoons in their hands , in hopes of catching it . and when the shepherd saw that it could run faster than they could , he threw his bonnet at it , and almost struck it ; but it escaped all these dangers , and soon it came to another house , where the folk were just going to bed . the goodman was half undressed , and the goodwife was raking the cinders carefully out of the fire .
