' exclaimed maie . and certainly it was a cow , a fine red cow , fat and flourishing , and looking as if it had been fed all its days on spinach . it wandered peacefully up and down the shore , and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass , as if it despised such fare . matte could not believe his eyes . but a cow she seemed , and a cow she was found to be ; and when the old woman began to milk her , every pitcher and pan , even to the baler , was soon filled with the most delicious milk . the old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there , and sallied forth to seek for his lost net . he had not proceeded far when he found it cast up on the shore , and so full of fish that not a mesh was visible .
