" what 's that ? " said he , " for the bowl of brose that i had at supper - time was n't very big . " " catch it , then , " answered his wife , " and i 'll have a bit , too . quick ! quick ! throw your coat over it or it will be away . " so the goodman threw his coat right on the top of the little bannock , and almost managed to smother it ; but it struggled bravely , and got out , breathless and hot , from under it . then it ran out into the grey light again , for night was beginning to fall , and the goodman ran out after it , without his coat . he chased it and chased it through the stackyard and across a field , and in amongst a fine patch of whins . then he lost it ; and , as he was feeling cold without his coat , he went home .
