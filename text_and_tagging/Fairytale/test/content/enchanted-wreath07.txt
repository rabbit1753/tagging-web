' how absurd to walk about on such a pouring night , dressed up like that , ' she remarked crossly , and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke , to place it on her own daughter . as she did so the roses became withered and brown , and the birds flew out of the window . ' see what a trumpery thing it is ! ' cried the stepmother ; ' and now take your supper and go to bed , for it is near upon midnight . ' but though she pretended to despise the wreath , she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it . now it happened that the next evening the father , who had been alone in the forest , came back a second time without his axe . the stepmother 's heart was glad when she saw this , and she said quite mildly : ' why , you have forgotten your axe again , you careless man ! but now your daughter shall stay at home , and mine shall go and bring it back ' ; and throwing a cloak over the girl 's shoulders , she bade her hasten to the forest .
