when he got to the forest , he too met the little grey old man , who greeted him and said : ' give me a piece of your cake and a draught from your bottle ; i am so hungry and thirsty . ' and dullhead replied : ' i 've only got a cinder - cake and some sour beer , but if you care to have that , let us sit down and eat . ' so they sat down , and when dullhead brought out his cake he found it had turned into a fine rich cake , and the sour beer into excellent wine . then they ate and drank , and when they had finished the little man said : ' now i will bring you luck , because you have a kind heart and are willing to share what you have with others . there stands an old tree ; cut it down , and amongst its roots you 'll find something . ' with that the little man took leave .
