' it is the man who is lying under the cask , ' answered the leader . ' go and kill him , and then come and eat your food and sleep , for we must be off betimes in the morning . ' so four of them killed the fisher 's son and left him , and then went to bed . by sunrise they were all out of the house , for they had far to go . and when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof , to where the dead man lay , and she shook her head over him , and wax fell from her ear , and he jumped up as well as ever . then ian was killed a second time , and after the rest of the robbers had eaten , they lay down and slept till morning . no sooner were their faces touched with the sun 's rays than they were up and off . then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the dead man , and he was as well as ever . by this time he did not mind what befell him , so sure was he that the deer would take care of him , and in the evening that which had happened before happened again -- the four robbers were put to death and the fisher 's son also , but because there was no food left for them to eat , they were nearly mad with rage , and began to quarrel . from quarrelling they went on to fighting , and fought so hard that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor . then the deer entered , and the fisher 's son was restored to life , and bidding him follow her , she ran on to a little white cottage where dwelt an old woman and her son , who was thin and dark .
