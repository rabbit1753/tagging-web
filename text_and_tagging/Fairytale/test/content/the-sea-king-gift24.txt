' it is all very fine to possess a cow , ' said matte , as he cleaned the fish ; ' but what are we going to feed her on ? ' ' we shall find some means , ' said his wife ; and the cow found the means herself . she went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore , and always kept in good condition . every one prince alone excepted , thought she was a clever beast ; but prince barked at her , for he had now got a rival . from that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets , and every net was filled with fish . matte and maie grew fat on this fine living , and daily became richer . she churned quantities of butter , and he hired two men to help him in his fishing . the sea lay before him like a big fish tank , out of which he hauled as many as he required ; and the cow continued to fend for herself . in autumn , when matte and maie went ashore , the cow went to sea , and in spring , when they returned to the rock , there she stood awaiting them .
