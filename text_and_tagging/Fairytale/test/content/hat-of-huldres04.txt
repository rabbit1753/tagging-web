" there is an old hair strainer for you . i found it outside on the ground , " said he , and he threw it on the bench . and then his wife saw him ; but at the same moment the hat of the huldres disappeared , for he should only have loaned it , not given it away . now the man saw how everything had come about , and went back to the wedding - feast . and this time he was received in right friendly fashion , and was asked to drink , and to seat himself at the table .
