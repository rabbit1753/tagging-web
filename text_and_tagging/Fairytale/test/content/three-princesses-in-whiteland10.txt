then the young king grew very sad , and went about day in , day out , with no other thought than getting back to his queen . " i must try and see whether i can not find out where whiteland is , " thought he , and wandered forth into the wide world . after he had gone a while he came to a hill ; and there he met one who was the lord of all the beasts of the forest -- for they came when he blew his horn -- and him the king asked where whiteland was . " that i do not know , " said he , " but i will ask my beasts . " then he called them up with his horn , and asked whether any of them knew where whiteland might be ; but none of them knew anything about it . then the man gave him a pair of snowshoes . " if you stand in them , " said he , " you will come to my brother , who lives a hundred miles further on . he is the lord of the birds of the air . ask him . when you have found him , turn the snowshoes around so that they point this way , and they will come back home of their own accord . " when the king got there , he turned the snowshoes around , as the lord of the beasts had told him , and they ran home again . he asked about whiteland , and the man called up all the birds with his horn , and asked whether any of them knew where whiteland might be . but none of them knew . long after the rest an old eagle came along ; and he had been out for some ten years , but did not know either .
