countess fraukirk ... hidden behind a curtain ... overheard every word . ] next day a boat went speeding over the narrow channel of water that separates pomona ( on the mainland ) from hoy . in it sat a woman , but who she was , or what she was like , no one could say , for she was covered from head to foot with a black cloak , and her face was hidden behind a thick , dark veil . snorro the dwarf knew her , even before she laid aside her trappings , for countess fraukirk was no stranger to him . in the course of her long life she had often had occasion to seek his aid to help her in her evil deeds , and she had always paid him well for his services in yellow gold . he therefore welcomed her gladly ; but when he had heard the nature of her errand his smiling face grew grave again , and he shook his head . " i have served thee well , lady , in the past , " he said , " but methinks that this thing goeth beyond my courage . for to compass an earl 's death is a weighty matter , especially when he is so well beloved as is the earl paul . " " thou knowest why i have taken up my abode in this lonely spot -- how i hope some day to light upon the magic carbuncle . thou knowest also how the people fear me , and hate me too , forsooth . and if the young earl died , and suspicion fell on me , i must needs fly the island , for my life would not be worth a grain of sand . then my chance of success would be gone . nay ! i can not do it , lady ; i can not do it . " but the wily countess offered him much gold , and bribed him higher and higher , first with wealth , then with success , and lastly she promised to obtain for him a high post at the court of the king of scotland ; and at that his ambition stirred within him , his determination gave way , and he consented to do what she asked . " i will summon my magic loom , " he said , " and weave a piece of cloth of finest texture and of marvellous beauty ; and before i weave it i will so poison the thread with a magic potion that , when it is fashioned into a garment , whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes . " " thou art a clever knave , " answered the countess , a cruel smile lighting up her evil face , " and thou shalt be rewarded . let me have a couple of yards of this wonderful web , and i will make a bonnie waistcoat for my fine young earl and give it to him as a yuletide gift . then i reckon that he will not see the year out . " " that will he not , " said dwarf snorro , with a malicious grin ; and the two parted , after arranging that the piece of cloth should be delivered at the palace of orphir on the day before christmas eve .
