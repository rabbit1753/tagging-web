the king did as the north wind told him . he stationed himself on the steps ; and when the north wind came roaring and rushing up , and laid hold of the castle walls till they fairly shook , the prince came out to see what it was all about . but that very moment the king seized him by the collar , and threw him out , and the north wind took him and carried him off . when he had borne him away , the king went into the castle . at first the queen did not recognize him , for he had grown thin and pale because he had wandered so long in his great distress ; but when he showed her the ring , she grew glad at heart , and then they had a wedding which was such a wedding that the news of it spread far and wide .
