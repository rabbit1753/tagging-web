but the wily countess offered him much gold , and bribed him higher and higher , first with wealth , then with success , and lastly she promised to obtain for him a high post at the court of the king of scotland ; and at that his ambition stirred within him , his determination gave way , and he consented to do what she asked . " i will summon my magic loom , " he said , " and weave a piece of cloth of finest texture and of marvellous beauty ; and before i weave it i will so poison the thread with a magic potion that , when it is fashioned into a garment , whoever puts it on will die ere he hath worn it many minutes . " " thou art a clever knave , " answered the countess , a cruel smile lighting up her evil face , " and thou shalt be rewarded . let me have a couple of yards of this wonderful web , and i will make a bonnie waistcoat for my fine young earl and give it to him as a yuletide gift . then i reckon that he will not see the year out .

" twill make a bonnie waistcoat , " exclaimed countess fraukirk , with an unholy laugh . " the silent earl will be a braw man when he gets it on . " then , without more ado , they set to work to cut out and sew the garment . all that night they worked , and all next day , till , late in the afternoon , when they were putting in the last stitches , hurried footsteps were heard ascending the winding staircase , and earl harold burst open the door .
