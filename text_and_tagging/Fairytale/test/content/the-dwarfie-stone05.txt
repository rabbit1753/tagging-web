harold , on the other hand , was as different from his brother as night is from day . he was fair - haired and blue - eyed , and he had gained for himself the name of harold the orator , because he was always free of speech and ready with his tongue . but for all this he was not a favourite . for he was haughty , and jealous , and quick - tempered , and the old folks ' eyes did not brighten at the sight of him , and the babes , instead of toddling out to greet him , hid their faces in their mothers ' skirts when they saw him coming . harold could not help knowing that the people liked his silent brother best , and the knowledge made him jealous of him , so a coldness sprang up between them . now it chanced , one summer , that earl harold went on a visit to the king of scotland , accompanied by his mother , the countess helga , and her sister , the countess fraukirk .
