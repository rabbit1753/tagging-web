but when he came out in the morning , the princesses were out of the ground up to their ankles . the third night came a troll who had nine heads and nine whips , and he beat and whipped the youth so severely that at last he fainted . then the troll took him and flung him against the wall , and as he did so the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth , and he was at once sound and whole again . then he did not delay , but grasped the sword , killed the troll , and when he came out in the morning , the princesses were entirely out of the ground . so he chose the youngest of them to be his queen , and lived long with her in peace and happiness . but at last he was minded to travel home , and see how his parents fared . this did not suit his queen ; but since he wanted to go so badly , and finally was on the point of departure , she said to him : " one thing you must promise me , that you will only do what your father tells you to do , but not what your mother tells you to do . " and this he promised . then she gave him a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it . so he wished himself home , and his parents could not get over their surprise at seeing how fine and handsome he had become .
