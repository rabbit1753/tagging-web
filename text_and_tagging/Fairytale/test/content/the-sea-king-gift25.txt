' we shall require a better house , ' said maie the following summer ; ' the old one is too small for ourselves and the men . ' ' yes , ' said matte . so he built a large cottage , with a real lock to the door , and a store - house for fish as well ; and he and his men caught such quantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon , herring , and cod to russian and sweden . ' i am quite overworked with so many folk , ' said maie ; ' a girl to help me would not come amiss . ' ' get one , then , ' said her husband ; and so they hired a girl . then maie said : ' we have too little milk for all these folk . now that i have a servant , with the same amount of trouble she could look after three cows . ' ' all right , then , ' said her husband , somewhat provoked , ' you can sing a song to the fairies . '
