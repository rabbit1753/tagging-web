the sun rose and she still slept on and on , although it was nearly noon . now , it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it . when his dogs came to the tree , they sniffed , and ran round and round it , barking . the king said to the huntsmen , ' see what sort of a wild beast is in there . ' the huntsmen went in , and then came back and said , ' in the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we do n't know , and we have never seen one like it ; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur ; but it is lying down asleep . ' the king said , ' see if you can catch it alive , and then fasten it to the cart , and we will take it with us . ' when the huntsmen seized the maiden , she awoke and was frightened , and cried out to them , ' i am a poor child , forsaken by father and mother ; take pity on me , and let me go with you . ' then they said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can work in the kitchen ; come with us and sweep the ashes together . ' so they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace . there they showed her a tiny room under the stairs , where no daylight came , and said to her , ' many - furred creature , you can live and sleep here . ' then she was sent into the kitchen , where she carried wood and water , poked the fire , washed vegetables , plucked fowls , swept up the ashes , and did all the dirty work . so the many - furred creature lived for a long time in great poverty . ah , beautiful king 's daughter , what is going to befall you now ?
