many , many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis - ball growing out of his right cheek . this lump was a great disfigurement to the old man , and so annoyed him that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it . he tried everything he could think of . he consulted many doctors far and near , and took all kinds of medicines both internally and externally . but it was all of no use . the lump only grew bigger and bigger till it was nearly as big as his face , and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it , and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life .
