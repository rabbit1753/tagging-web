now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . " hoot , " she said , " what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . " so she jumped up with her lint and her lint cards , and the tailor jumped up with his great shears , and one apprentice grasped the line measure , while another took up the saucer full of pins ; and they all tried to catch the wee bannock . but it dodged them round and round the fire , and at last it got safely out of the door and ran down the road , with one of the apprentices after it , who tried to snip it in two with his shears . it ran too quickly for him , however , and at last he stopped and went back to the house , while the wee bannock ran on until it came to a tiny cottage by the roadside . it trundled in at the door , and there was a weaver sitting at his loom , with his wife beside him , winding a clue of yarn .
