but that was just the very thing that happened . the lady morna , thinking no evil , accepted the countess helga 's invitation , and no sooner had the party arrived back in orkney than paul , charmed with the grace and beauty of the fair irish maiden , fell head over ears in love with her . and the lady morna , from the very first hour that she saw him , returned his love . of course this state of things could not long go on hidden , and when harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds . seizing a dagger , he rushed up to the turret where his brother was sitting in his private apartments , and threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the lovely stranger . but paul met him with pleasant words . " calm thyself , brother , " he said . " it is true that i love the lady , but that is no proof that i shall win her . is it likely that she will choose me , whom all men name paul the silent , when she hath the chance of marrying you , whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of harold the orator ? " at these words harold 's vanity was flattered , and he thought that , after all , his step - brother was right , and that he had a very small chance , with his meagre gift of speech , of being successful in his suit . so he threw down his dagger , and , shaking hands with him , begged him to pardon his unkind thoughts , and went down the winding stair again in high good - humour with himself and all the world . by this time it was coming near to the feast of yule , and at that festival it was the custom for the earl and his court to leave kirkwall for some weeks , and go to the great palace of orphir , nine miles distant . and in order to see that everything was ready , earl paul took his departure some days before the others . the evening before he left he chanced to find the lady morna sitting alone in one of the deep windows of the great hall . she had been weeping , for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure ; and at the sight of her distress the kind - hearted young earl could no longer contain himself , but , folding her in his arms , he whispered to her how much he loved her , and begged her to promise to be his wife .
