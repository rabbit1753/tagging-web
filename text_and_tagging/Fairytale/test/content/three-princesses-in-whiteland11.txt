" well , " said the man , " i will lend you a pair of snowshoes . when you stand in them you will come to my brother , who lives a hundred miles further on . he is the lord of all the fishes in the sea . ask him . but do not forget to turn the snowshoes around again . " the king thanked him , stepped into the snowshoes , and when he came to the one who was lord of all the fishes in the sea , he turned them around , and they ran back like the others . there he once more asked about whiteland . the man called up his fishes with his horn , but none of them knew anything about it . at last there came an old , old carp , whom he had called with his horn only at the cost of much trouble . when he asked him , he said : " yes , i know it well , for i was cook there for fully ten years . to - morrow i have to go back again , because our queen , whose king has not come home again , is going to marry some one else . " " if such be the case , " said the man , " i 'll give you a bit of advice . out there by the wall three brothers have been standing for the last hundred years , fighting with each other about a hat , a cloak and a pair of boots . any one who has these three things can make himself invisible , and wish himself away as far as ever he will . you might say that you would test their possessions , and then decide their quarrel for them .
