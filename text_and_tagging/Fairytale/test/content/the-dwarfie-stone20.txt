now , when the countess fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand , strange things were happening at the castle at kirkwall . for harold , encouraged by his brother 's absence , offered his heart and hand once more to the lady morna . once more she refused him , and in order to make sure that the scene should not be repeated , she told him that she had plighted her troth to his brother . when he heard that this was so , rage and fury were like to devour him . mad with anger , he rushed from her presence , flung himself upon his horse , and rode away in the direction of the sea shore . while he was galloping wildly along , his eyes fell on the snow - clad hills of hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the one island from the other . and his thoughts flew at once to snorro the dwarf , who he had had occasion , as well as his step - aunt , to visit in bygone days . " i have it , " he cried . " stupid fool that i was not to think of it at once . i will go to snorro , and buy from him a love - potion , which will make my lady morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindly towards me . " so he made haste to hire a boat , and soon he was speeding over the tossing waters on his way to the island of hoy . when he arrived there he hurried up the lonely valley to where the dwarfie stone stood , and he had no difficulty in finding its uncanny occupant , for snorro was standing at the hole that served as a door , his raven on his shoulder , gazing placidly at the setting sun . a curious smile crossed his face when , hearing the sound of approaching footsteps , he turned round and his eyes fell on the young noble . " what bringeth thee here , sir earl ? " he asked gaily , for he scented more gold . " i come for a love - potion , " said harold ; and without more ado he told the whole story to the wizard . " i will pay thee for it , " he added , " if thou wilt give it to me quickly . " snorro looked at him from head to foot . " blind must the maiden be , sir orator , " he said , " who needeth a love - potion to make her fancy so gallant a knight . " earl harold laughed angrily . " it is easier to catch a sunbeam than a woman 's roving fancy , " he replied . " i have no time for jesting . for , hearken , old man , there is a proverb that saith , ' time and tide wait for no man , ' so i need not expect the tide to wait for me . the potion i must have , and that instantly .
