" nothing easier , " said molo . " on the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them , and thus i will carry you there . yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl 's court , who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god . no one can pass by him , so he must be killed . " when the appointed day had come , the servant said : " there is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself ! " full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine , and the old man took a chain - hammer and disappeared with it .
