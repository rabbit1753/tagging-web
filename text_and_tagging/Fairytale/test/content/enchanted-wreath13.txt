in a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned , and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning , so that his wife would be alone all day . this was a chance not to be missed , and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace , where she had never been before . the princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one , and she welcomed them both gladly , and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them . at last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her ; and here , the woman seizing her opportunity , stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing , into the deep water , where she instantly sank to the bottom . then she fastened the mask on her daughter , flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak , which the princess had let fall , and finally arranged a lace veil over her head .
