and while he was at court he met a charming young irish lady , the lady morna , who had come from ireland to scotland to attend upon the scottish queen . she was so sweet , and good , and gentle that earl harold 's heart was won , and he made up his mind that she , and only she , should be his bride . but although he had paid her much attention , lady morna had sometimes caught glimpses of his jealous temper ; she had seen an evil expression in his eyes , and had heard him speak sharply to his servants , and she had no wish to marry him . so , to his great amazement , she refused the honour which he offered her , and told him that she would prefer to remain as she was . earl harold ground his teeth in silent rage , but he saw that it was no use pressing his suit at that moment . so what he could not obtain by his own merits he determined to obtain by guile . accordingly he begged his mother to persuade the lady morna to go back with them on a visit , hoping that when she was alone with him in orkney , he would be able to overcome her prejudice against him , and induce her to become his wife . and all the while he never remembered his brother paul ; or , if he did , he never thought it possible that he could be his rival .
