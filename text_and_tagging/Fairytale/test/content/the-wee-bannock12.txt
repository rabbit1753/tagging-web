but the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller , so it turned and ran out of the mill , and the miller was so busy that he did not trouble himself to run after it . after this it ran on , and on , and on , till it came to the smithy , and it popped in there to see what it could see . the smith was busy at the anvil making horse - shoe nails , but he looked up as the wee bannock entered .
