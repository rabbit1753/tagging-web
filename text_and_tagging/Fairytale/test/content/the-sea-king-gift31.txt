' what is that shining so brightly in the waves ? ' asked maie . ' that is sea foam glinting in the sunshine , ' answered the fiddler . ' throw out the stones , ' said maie . the people in the boat began to throw out the stones , splash , splash , right and left , into the foam . one stone hit the nose of wellamos 's chief lady - in - waiting , another scratched the sea queen herself on the cheek , a third plumped close to ahti 's head and tore off half of the sea - king 's beard ; then there was a commotion in the sea , the waves bubbled and bubbled like boiling water in a pot
