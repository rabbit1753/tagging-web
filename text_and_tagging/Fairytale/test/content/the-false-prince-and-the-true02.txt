the king had listened attentively to the story , and when it was ended he said : ' i suppose the prince had no arms with him , or else he would have used them ? ' ' yes , sire , he had arms ; he always carries a dagger in his belt . but when he saw the blood pouring from his face , he went to a corner of the court and began to cry , which was the strangest thing of all . ' on hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a few minutes with his back to the room , where the company of young men remained silent . then he came back , his face white and stern . ' i tell you , ' he said , ' and it is the solemn truth , that i would rather you had told me that the prince was dead , though he is my only son , than know that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avenge it . as for the gentleman who struck him , he will be brought before my judges , and will plead his own cause , but i hardly think he can escape death , after having assaulted the heir to the crown .
