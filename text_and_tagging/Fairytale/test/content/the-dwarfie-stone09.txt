at these words harold 's vanity was flattered , and he thought that , after all , his step - brother was right , and that he had a very small chance , with his meagre gift of speech , of being successful in his suit . so he threw down his dagger , and , shaking hands with him , begged him to pardon his unkind thoughts , and went down the winding stair again in high good - humour with himself and all the world . by this time it was coming near to the feast of yule , and at that festival it was the custom for the earl and his court to leave kirkwall for some weeks , and go to the great palace of orphir , nine miles distant . and in order to see that everything was ready , earl paul took his departure some days before the others . the evening before he left he chanced to find the lady morna sitting alone in one of the deep windows of the great hall . she had been weeping , for she was full of sadness at the thought of his departure ; and at the sight of her distress the kind - hearted young earl could no longer contain himself , but , folding her in his arms , he whispered to her how much he loved her , and begged her to promise to be his wife .
