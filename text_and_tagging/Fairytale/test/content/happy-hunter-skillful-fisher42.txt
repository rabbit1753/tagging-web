ryn jin now desired to punish the tai , but the happy hunter begged him not to do so ; since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor tai . it was indeed the tai who had taken the hook , but he had already suffered enough for his fault , if fault it could be called . what had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention . the happy hunter said he blamed himself ; if he had understood how to fish properly he would never have lost his hook , and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do . so he begged the sea king to forgive his subject .
