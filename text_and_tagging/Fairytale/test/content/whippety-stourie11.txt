" ye promised me what i liked to ask , and i have asked your son ; and your son i will have , " she replied , " so it is useless making such a din about it . but one thing i may tell you , for i know well that the knowledge will not help you . by the laws of fairy - land , i can not take the bairn till the third day after this , and if by that time you have found out my name i can not take him even then . but ye will not be able to find it out , of that i am certain . so i will call back for the boy in three days . " and with that she disappeared round the back of the pig - sty , and the poor mother fell down in a dead faint beside the stone . all that day , and all the next , she did nothing but sit in her kitchen and cry , and hug her baby tighter in her arms ; but on the day before that on which the fairy said that she was coming back , she felt as if she must get a little breath of fresh air , so she went for a walk in the fir wood behind the house .
