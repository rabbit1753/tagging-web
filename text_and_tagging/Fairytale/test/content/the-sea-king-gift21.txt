both rose . the summer night was as dark as if it had been october , the weather - cock creaked , and the storm was raging in every direction . as they went out the sea lay around them as white as now , and the spray was dashing right over the fisher - hut . in all his life matte had never remembered such a night . to launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the net was a thing not to be thought of . the fisherman and his wife stood aghast on the doorstep , holding on fast by the doorpost , while the foam splashed over their faces . ' did i not tell thee that there is no luck in sunday fishing ? ' said matte sulkily ; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of ahti 's cows . as there was nothing to be done , they went in . their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber , and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling . when they awoke , the sun was high in the heavens , the tempest had cased , and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock . ' what can that be ? ' said the old woman , as she peeped out of the door . ' it looks like a big seal , ' said matte . ' as sure as i live , it 's a cow ! ' exclaimed maie . and certainly it was a cow , a fine red cow , fat and flourishing , and looking as if it had been fed all its days on spinach . it wandered peacefully up and down the shore , and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass , as if it despised such fare . matte could not believe his eyes . but a cow she seemed , and a cow she was found to be ; and when the old woman began to milk her , every pitcher and pan , even to the baler , was soon filled with the most delicious milk . the old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there , and sallied forth to seek for his lost net . he had not proceeded far when he found it cast up on the shore , and so full of fish that not a mesh was visible .
