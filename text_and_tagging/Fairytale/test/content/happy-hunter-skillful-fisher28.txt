" are you indeed the daughters of ryn jin , the king of the sea ? i can not tell you how glad i am to meet you , " said the happy hunter . and without waiting for them to reply he went on : " the other day i went fishing with my brother 's hook and dropped it , how , i am sure i ca n't tell . as my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions , this is the greatest calamity that could have befallen me . unless i find it again i can never hope to win my brother 's forgiveness , for he is very angry at what i have done . i have searched for it many , many times , but i can not find it , therefore i am much troubled . while i was hunting for the hook , in great distress , i met a wise old man , and he told me that the best thing i could do was to come to ryn gu , and to ryn jin , the dragon king of the sea , and ask him to help me . this kind old man also showed me how to come . now you know how it is i am here and why . i want to ask ryn jin , if he knows where the lost hook is . will you be so kind as to take me to your father ? and do you think he will see me ? " asked the happy hunter anxiously .
