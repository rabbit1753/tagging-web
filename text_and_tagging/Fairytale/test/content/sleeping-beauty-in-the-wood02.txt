after the ceremonies of the christening were over , all the company returned to the king 's palace , where was prepared a great feast for the fairies . there was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold , wherein were a spoon , knife , and fork , all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies . but as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy , whom they had not invited , because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower , and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted . the king ordered her a cover , but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others , because they had only seven made for the seven fairies . the old fairy fancied she was slighted , and muttered some threats between her teeth . one of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how she grumbled ; and , judging that she might give the little princess some unlucky gift , went , as soon as they rose from table , and hid herself behind the hangings , that she might speak last , and repair , as much as she could , the evil which the old fairy might intend .
