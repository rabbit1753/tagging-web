at any rate , his poor young wife was sorely to be pitied , for she was left with a little baby - boy to bring up , and , as times were bad , she had not much to live on . but she loved her baby dearly , and worked all day amongst her cows , and pigs , and hens , in order to earn enough money to buy food and clothes for both herself and him . now , on the morning of which i am speaking , she rose very early and went out to feed her pigs , for rent - day was coming on , and she intended to take one of them , a great , big , fat creature , to the market that very day , as she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent . and because she thought so , her heart was light , and she hummed a little song to herself as she crossed the yard with her bucket on one arm and her baby - boy on the other .
