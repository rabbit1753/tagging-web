the next morning he went to the false bride 's room , but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up , though she ate everything they set before her . the prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her , for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment , and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her , and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself . at length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians ; he did not tell her what he was going to do , lest it should make her worse , but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king 's person to follow him to the princess 's apartments . unfortunately , as they entered , the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves , and shrieked out : ' dirty creatures ! dirty creatures ! ' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once , and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain . he then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness , but not a word would she say .
