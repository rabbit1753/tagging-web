' she said , turning towards them , ' if one of you were killed to - day , the rest would fly ; but this man put his trust in me , and had his head cut off three times . because he has done this , i will marry him rather than one of you , who have come hither to we d me , for many kings here sought to free me from the spells , but none could do it save ian the fisher 's son .
