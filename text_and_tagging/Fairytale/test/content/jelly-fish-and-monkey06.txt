then the doctor told the dragon king that some distance to the south there was a monkey island where a great many monkeys lived . " if only you could capture one of these monkeys ? " said the doctor . " how can any of my people capture a monkey ? " said the dragon king , greatly puzzled . " the monkeys live on dry land , while we live in the water ; and out of our element we are quite powerless ! i do n't see what we can do ! " " that has been my difficulty too , " said the doctor . " but amongst your innumerable servants you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose ! " " something must be done , " said the king , and calling his chief steward he consulted him on the matter .
