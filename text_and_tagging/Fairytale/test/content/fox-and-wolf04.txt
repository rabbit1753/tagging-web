at the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water , but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was . the fox 's quick ears heard the sound of his paws , though they were soft as velvet , and turning her head she said politely : ' is that you , neighbour ? what a strange place to meet in ! i hope you are quite well ? ' ' quite well as regards my health , ' answered the wolf , whose eye glistened greedily , ' at least , as well as one can be when one is very hungry . but what is the matter with you ? a fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish ! ' ' i have been ill - very ill , ' replied the fox , ' and what you say is quite true . a worm is fat in comparison with me . '
