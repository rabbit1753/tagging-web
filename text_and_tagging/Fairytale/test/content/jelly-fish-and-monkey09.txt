" i 'm in luck ! " thought the jelly fish . " now i must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the palace , and my part will be done ! " so the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine - tree . in those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise . when he got to the pine - tree he raised his voice and said : " how do you do , mr . monkey ? is n't it a lovely day ? " " a very fine day , " answered the monkey from the tree . " i have never seen you in this part of the world before . where have you come from and what is your name ? " " my name is kurage or jelly fish . i am one of the servants of the dragon king . i have heard so much of your beautiful island that i have come on purpose to see it , " answered the jelly fish . " i am very glad to see you , " said the monkey . " by the bye , " said the jelly fish , " have you ever seen the palace of the dragon king of the sea where i live ? " " i have often heard of it , but i have never seen it ! " answered the monkey . " then you ought most surely to come . it is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it . the beauty of the palace is beyond all description - it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world , " said the jelly fish .
