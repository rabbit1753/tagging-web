but his brother complained of being weary , and at length they decided to remain there for the night . when andrew awoke he found himself alone ; and he saw neither brother nor boat , until he came to the highest point of the island . then he discovered him far out , darting for land like a sea - gull . andrew did not understand the whole affair . there were still provisions there , as well as a dish of curd , his gun and various other things . so andrew wasted but little time in thought . " he will come back this evening , " said he . " only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat . " but in the evening there was no brother to be seen , and andrew waited day by day , and week by week ; until at last , he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself , and not have to divide it . and such was the case , for when john nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip , he had capsized the boat , and declared that lucky andrew had been drowned . but after her mother had gone , she found so many berries that she forgot to say her verse , and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill . and there no harm had been done her , save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand , and the goblins had been kind to her ; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be , she felt as though something weighed upon her , and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband . when andrew learned who her mother and her people were , he saw that they were related to him , and they became very good friends . so andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star . then they sailed home , and took along the schooner , and all the gold and silver , and all the treasure which had been left in the hut , and then andrew was far wealthier than his brother .
