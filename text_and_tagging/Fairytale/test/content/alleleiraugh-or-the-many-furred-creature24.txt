when the dance was ended , the king had his soup brought to him and ate it , and it was so good that he thought he had never tasted such soup in his life . but when he came to the bottom of the dish he saw a gold ring lying there , and he could not imagine how it got in . then he commanded the cook to be brought before him . the cook was terrified when he heard the command , and said to the many - furred creature , ' you must have let a hair fall into the soup , and if you have you deserve a good beating ! ' when he came before the king , the king asked who had cooked the soup . the cook answered , ' i cooked it . ' but the king said , ' that 's not true , for it was quite different and much better soup than you have ever cooked . ' then the cook said , ' i must confess ; i did not cook the soup ; the many - furred creature did . ' ' let her be brought before me , ' said the king . but when the dance was ended , she disappeared again so quickly that the king could not see which way she went . she ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the many - furred creature , and went into the kitchen to cook the bread - soup . when the cook was upstairs , she fetched the golden spinning - wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it . it was brought to the king , who ate it , and liked it as much as the last time . he had the cook sent to him , and again he had to confess that the many - furred creature had cooked the soup . then the many - furred creature came before the king , but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head , and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning - wheel . when the king had a feast for the third time , things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two . the cook said , ' you must be a witch , many - furred creature , for you always put something in the soup , so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the king than any that i cook . ' but because she begged hard , he let her go up for the usual time . now she put on the dress as shining as the stars , and stepped into the hall in it .
