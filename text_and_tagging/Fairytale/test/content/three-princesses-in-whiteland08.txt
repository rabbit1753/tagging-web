when he had been home a few days , his mother wanted him to go up to the castle and show the king what a man he had grown to be . his father said : " no , he had better not do that , for we will have to do without him in the meantime . " but there was no help for it , the mother begged and pleaded until he went . when he got there he was more splendidly dressed and fitted out than the other king . this did not suit the latter , and he said : " you can see what my queen looks like , but i can not see yours ; and i do not believe yours is as beautiful as mine . " " god grant she were standing here , then you would see soon enough ! " said the young king , and there she stood that very minute . but she was very sad , and said to him : " why did you not follow my advice and listen to your father ? now i must go straight home , and you have used up both of your wishes . " with that she bound a ring with her name on it in his hair , and wished herself home .
