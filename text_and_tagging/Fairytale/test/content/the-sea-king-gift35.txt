' heavens , mother , ' said he , ' where are you coming from at such a whirlwind pace , and what makes you in such a dripping condition ? ' maie looked around her amazed , and said , ' where is our two - storey house ? ' ' what house ? ' asked her husband . ' our big house , and the flower garden , and the men and the maids , and the thirty beautiful cows , and the steamer , and everything else ? ' ' you are talking nonsense , mother , ' said he . ' the students have quite turned your head , for you sang silly songs last evening while we were rowing , and then you could not sleep till early morning . we had stormy weather during the night , and when it was past i did not wish to waken you , so rowed out alone to rescue the net . ' ' but i 've seen ahti , ' rejoined maie . ' you 've been lying in bed , dreaming foolish fancies , mother , and then in your sleep you walked into the water . ' ' but there is the fiddle , ' said maie . ' a fine fiddle ! it is only an old stick . no , no , old woman , another time we will be more careful . good luck never attends fishing on a sunday . '
