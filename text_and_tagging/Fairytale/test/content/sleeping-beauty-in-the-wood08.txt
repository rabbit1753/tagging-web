they went into the great hall of looking - glasses , where they supped , and were served by the princess 's officers , the violins and hautboys played old tunes , but very excellent , though it was now above a hundred years since they had played ; and after supper , without losing any time , the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle , and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains . they had but very little sleep - the princess had no occasion ; and the prince left her next morning to return to the city , where his father must needs have been in pain for him . the prince told him : that he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting , and that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoal - burner , who gave him cheese and brown bread . the king , his father , who was a good man , believed him ; but his mother could not be persuaded it was true ; and seeing that he went almost every day a - hunting , and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing , though he had lain out three or four nights together , she began to suspect that he was married , for he lived with the princess above two whole years , and had by her two children , the eldest of which , who was a daughter , was named morning , and the youngest , who was a son , they called day , because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than his sister .
