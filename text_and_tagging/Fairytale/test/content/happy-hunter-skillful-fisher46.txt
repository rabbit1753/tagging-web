king ryn jin was overcome with sorrow at the thought that he must lose his friend who had made a great diversion in the palace of the sea , and his tears fell fast as he answered : " we are indeed very sorry to part with you , mikoto , for we have enjoyed your stay with us very much . you have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome . i quite understand that as you govern japan you ought to be there and not here , and that it is vain for us to try and keep you longer with us , much as we would like to have you stay . i hope you will not forget us . strange circumstances have brought us together and i trust the friendship thus begun between the land and the sea will last and grow stronger than it has ever been before .
