at the foot of some high mountains there was , once upon a time , a small village , and a little way off two roads met , one of them going to the east and the other to the west . the villagers were quiet , hard - working folk , who toiled in the fields all day , and in the evening set out for home when the bell began to ring in the little church . in the summer mornings they led out their flocks to pasture , and were happy and contented from sunrise to sunset . one summer night , when a round full moon shone down upon the white road , a great wolf came trotting round the corner .
