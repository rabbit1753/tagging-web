a joyful woman was the mistress of kittlerumpit when she saw it do this , for she felt that her rent was safe ; and in her relief and gratitude she would have kissed the hem of the strange lady 's green gown , if she would have allowed it , but she would not . " no , no , " said she , and her voice sounded harsher than ever . " let us have no fine meanderings , but let us stick to our bargain . i have done my part , and mended the pig ; now ye must do yours , and give me what i like to ask -- your son . " then the poor widow gave a piteous cry , for she knew now what she had not guessed before -- that the green - clad lady was a fairy , and a wicked fairy too , else had she not asked such a terrible thing . it was too late now , however , to pray , and beseech , and beg for mercy ; the fairy stood her ground , hard and cruel .
