" the doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out ! why i shall die ! " thought the monkey . at last a bright thought struck him , so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish : " what a pity it was , mr . jelly fish , that you did not speak of this before we left the island ! " " if i had told why i wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come , " answered the jelly fish . " you are quite mistaken , " said the monkey . " monkeys can very well spare a liver or two , especially when it is wanted for the dragon queen of the sea . if i had only guessed of what you were in need . i should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked . i have several livers . but the greatest pity is , that as you did not speak in time , i have left all my livers hanging on the pine - tree . " " have you left your liver behind you ? " asked the jelly fish . " yes , " said the cunning monkey , " during the daytime i usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree , as it is very much in the way when i am climbing about from tree to tree . to - day , listening to your interesting conversation , i quite forgot it , and left it behind when i came off with you . if only you had spoken in time i should have remembered it , and should have brought it along with me !
