" god be praised for good company ! that was just what i needed . yes , it is true , as i have always said , that i was born under a lucky star , " thought andrew to himself ; perhaps he said so too , for occasionally he really had to talk a little . so he lived through the fall . once he saw a boat , and hung a rag on a pole and waved with it ; but that very moment the sail dropped , and the crew took to the oars and rowed away at top speed , for they thought the meer - trolls were making signs and waving .
