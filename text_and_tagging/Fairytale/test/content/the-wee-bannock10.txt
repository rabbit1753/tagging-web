but it was not so easy to get hold of the wee bannock . it was in vain that the goodwife threw her clue at it , and that the goodman tried to chase it into a corner and knock it down with his shuttle . it dodged , and turned , and twisted , like a thing bewitched , till at last it flew out at the door again , and vanished down the hill , " for all the world , " as the old woman said , " like a new tarred sheep , or a daft cow . " in the next house that it came to it found the goodwife in the kitchen , kirning . she had just filled her kirn , and there was still some cream standing in the bottom of her cream jar . " come away , little bannock , " she cried when she saw it . " thou art come in just the nick of time , for i am beginning to feel hungry , and i 'll have cakes and cream for my dinner . "
