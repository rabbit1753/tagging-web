" madam , " she said , with a sob in her voice , " i bid you welcome to the house of kittlerumpit , although you find its mistress one of the most unfortunate women in the world . " " hout - tout , " answered the old lady , in such a harsh voice that the young woman started , and grasped her baby tighter in her arms . " ye have little need to say that . ye have lost your husband , i grant ye , but there were waur losses at shirra - muir . and now your pig is like to die -- i could , maybe , remedy that . but i must first hear how much ye wad gie me if i cured him . " " anything that your ladyship 's madam likes to ask , " replied the widow , too much delighted at having the animal 's life saved to think that she was making rather a rash promise . " very good , " said the old dame , and without wasting any more words she walked straight into the pig - sty .
