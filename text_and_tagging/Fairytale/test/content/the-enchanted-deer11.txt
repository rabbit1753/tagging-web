as soon as the lady had departed the fisher 's son awoke , and the dark lad told him of her visit , and how he would never see her as long as he lived . at this the fisher 's son felt the cold creeping up to his heart , yet he knew the fault had not been his that sleep had overtaken him . ' i will search the whole world through till i find her , ' cried he , and the dark lad laughed as he heard him . but the fisher 's son took no heed , and off he went , following the sun day after day , till his shoes were in holes and his feet were sore from the journey . nought did he see but the birds that made their nests in the trees , not so much as a goat or a rabbit . on and on and on he went , till suddenly he came upon a little house , with a woman standing outside it .
