then the rich neighbor fell into a rage , rushed up and gave the giant a good kick . but that did not help him , for his foot stuck to the giant , while the latter no more felt the kick than if it had been a flea - bite , and kept right on working . then the rich neighbor thought of a scheme to get free , and gave the giant a kick with his other foot ; but this foot also stuck fast , and there he hung like a tick . old hopgiant mowed the whole meadow , and then flew up into the air , and the rich man had to go along hanging to him like a hawser . and thus the poor neighbor was left sole master of the place .
