there was once a rich peasant who had two sons , named john nicholas and lucky andrew . the oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail . he was a most unpleasant customer to deal with , and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the northland are , as a rule , though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities . the other , lucky andrew , was wild and high spirited , but always good natured , and no matter how badly off he might be , he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star . when the eagle , in order to defend his nest , belabored his head and face till the blood ran , he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star , if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet . did his boat capsize , which occasionally happened , and did they discover him hanging to it , quite overcome with the water , cold and exertion , and asked him how he felt , he would reply : " o , quite well . i have been saved . i surely am in luck !
