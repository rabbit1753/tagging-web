her plan was this . in the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch , who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew . to this witch she would go and beg her to make her a mask with the face of her stepdaughter , and when she had the mask the rest would be easy . she told her daughter what she meant to do , and although the daughter could only say ' dirty creatures , ' in answer , she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased .
