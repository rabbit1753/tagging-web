" well , he shall have some of the money , " said the merchant to himself , " but not all of it . for he has to thank me for the cat , which i bought for him , and charity begins at home . " but while the merchant was thinking these thoughts , such a storm and tempest arose that all thought the ship would sink . then the merchant realized that there was nothing left for him to do but to promise that the boy should have all the money . no sooner had he made his vow , than the weather turned fair , and he had a favoring wind for his journey home . and when he landed , he gave the youth the six hundred dollars and his daughter to boot . for now the scullion was as rich as the merchant himself and richer , and thereafter he lived in splendor and happiness . and he took in his mother and treated her kindly . " for i do not believe that charity begins at home , " said the youth .
