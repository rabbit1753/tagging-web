on christmas eve andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea ; and when he came out , he saw a glow of light that came from a great northland schooner , which was gliding toward the land -- yet such a ship he had never yet seen . it has a main - sail of uncommon size , which looked to him to be of silk , and the most delicate tackling , as thin as though woven of steel wire , and everything else was in proportion , as fine and handsome as any northlander might wish to have . the whole schooner was filled with little people dressed in blue , but the girl who stood at the helm was adorned like a bride , and looked as splendid as a queen , for she wore a crown and costly garments . yet any one could see that she was a human being , for she was tall , and handsomer than the meer - folk . in fact , lucky andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had seen . the schooner headed for the land where andrew stood ; but with his usual presence of mind , he hurried to the fisherman 's hut , pulled down his gun from the wall , and crept up into the large loft and hid himself , so that he could see all that passed in the hut . he soon noticed that the whole room was alive with people .
