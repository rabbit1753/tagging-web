' why did you throw stones at me ? ' roared the sea - king . ' oh , your majesty , it was a mistake ! put some bear 's grease on your beard and that will soon make it grow again . ' ' dame , did i not give you all you asked for -- nay , even more ? ' ' truly , truly , your majesty . many thanks for the cows . ' ' well , where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon that you promised me ? ' ' ah , your majesty , they have been scattered day and night upon the sea , except when the sky was overcast , ' slyly answered maie . ' i 'll teach you ! ' roared the sea - king ; and with that he gave the fiddle such a ' puff ' that it sent the old woman up like a sky - rocket on to her island . there prince lay , as famished as ever , gnawing the carcase of a crow . there sat matte in his ragged grey jacket , quite alone , on the steps of the old hut , mending a net .
