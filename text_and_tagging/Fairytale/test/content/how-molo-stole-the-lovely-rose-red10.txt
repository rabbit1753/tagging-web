" the youth looked at molo . molo was quite willing . first he asked permission to carry away rose - red 's gear and jewels in sacks and bags . three times he went away and returned until he had finished . then he took his master and rose - red upon his back , and flew away with them over the steep walls . none of the watchmen of the prince 's palace noticed anything out of the way . at home the youth hid rose - red in a distant room . when the prince discovered that one of his slave - girls was missing , and that one of his wild dogs had been killed , he said : " that must have been some powerful sword hero ! " and he gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned , and that investigations should be made in secret .
