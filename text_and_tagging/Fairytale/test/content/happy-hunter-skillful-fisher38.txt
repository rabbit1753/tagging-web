all the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words , and could say nothing for some time . they sat looking at each other and at the dragon king . at last the cuttlefish came forward and said : " i think the tai ( the red bream ) must be the thief who has stolen the hook ! " " where is your proof ? " asked the king . " since yesterday evening the tai has not been able to eat anything , and he seems to be suffering from a bad throat ! for this reason i think the hook may be in his throat . you had better send for him at once !
