the old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened . he hardly knew for some time where he was . when he came to understand what had happened to him , he was delighted to find that the lump on his face , which had for so many years disfigured him , had really been taken away without any pain to himself . he put up his hand to feel if any scar remained , but found that his right cheek was as smooth as his left .
