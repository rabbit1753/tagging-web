it took some time to discover the whereabouts of the old woman , but at length it was accomplished , and when she arrived at the palace with the equerry , she was received with royal honours , as became the bride of the prince . the guards looked at each other with astonished eyes , as the wizened creature , bowed with age , passed between their lines ; but they were more amazed still at the lightness of her step as she skipped up the steps to the great door before which the king was standing , with the prince at his side . if they both felt a shock at the appearance of the aged lady they did not show it , and the king , with a grave bow , took her band , and led her to the chapel , where a bishop was waiting to perform the marriage ceremony . for the next few weeks little was seen of the prince , who spent all his days in hunting , and trying to forget the old wife at home . as for the princess , no one troubled himself about her , and she passed the days alone in her apartments , for she had absolutely declined the services of the ladies - in - waiting whom the king had appointed for her .
