' the prince consented to this , and led his beautiful bride home , where the wedding was held with great pomp and magnificence . the young couple lived happily together till winter came , when the flower queen 's daughter departed and went home to her mother . in summer she returned to her husband , and their life of joy and happiness began again , and lasted till the approach of winter , when the flower queen 's daughter went back again to her mother . this coming and going continued all her life long , and in spite of it they always lived happily together .
