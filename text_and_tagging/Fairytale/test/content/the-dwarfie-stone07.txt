but that was just the very thing that happened . the lady morna , thinking no evil , accepted the countess helga 's invitation , and no sooner had the party arrived back in orkney than paul , charmed with the grace and beauty of the fair irish maiden , fell head over ears in love with her . and the lady morna , from the very first hour that she saw him , returned his love . of course this state of things could not long go on hidden , and when harold realised what had happened his anger and jealousy knew no bounds . seizing a dagger , he rushed up to the turret where his brother was sitting in his private apartments , and threatened to stab him to the heart if he did not promise to give up all thoughts of winning the lovely stranger . but paul met him with pleasant words . " calm thyself , brother , " he said . " it is true that i love the lady , but that is no proof that i shall win her . is it likely that she will choose me , whom all men name paul the silent , when she hath the chance of marrying you , whose tongue moves so swiftly that to you is given the proud title of harold the orator ?
