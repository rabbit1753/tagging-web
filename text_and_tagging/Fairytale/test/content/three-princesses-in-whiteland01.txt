once upon a time there was a fisherman , who lived near the king 's castle , and caught fish for the king 's table . one day when he had gone fishing , he could not catch a thing . try as he might , no matter how he baited or flung , not the tiniest fish would bite ; but when this had gone on for a while , a head rose from the water and said : " if you will give me the first new thing that has come into your house , you shall catch fish a - plenty ! " then the man agreed quickly , for he could think of no new thing that might have come into the house . so he caught fish all day long , and as many as he could wish for , as may well be imagined .
