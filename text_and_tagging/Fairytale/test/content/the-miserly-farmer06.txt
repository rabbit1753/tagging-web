when the bonze had begun to make his magic , the farmer , too , had mingled with the crowd . with neck outstretched and staring eyes he had stood there and had entirely forgotten the business he hoped to do with his pears . when the bonze had gone off he turned around to look after his cart . his pears had all disappeared . then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own . he looked more closely , and the axle of his cart had disappeared . it was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently . the farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could . and when he turned the corner , there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall . and then he realized that the pear - tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle . the bonze , however , was nowhere to be found . and the whole crowd in the market burst out into loud laughter .
