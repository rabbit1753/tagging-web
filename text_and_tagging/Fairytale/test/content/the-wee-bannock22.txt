as for the poor little bannock , it thought that it would creep under a whin bush and lie there till morning , but it was so dark that it never saw that there was a fox 's hole there . so it fell down the fox 's hole , and the fox was very glad to see it , for he had had no food for two days . " oh , welcome , welcome , " he cried ; and he snapped it through the middle with his teeth , and that was the end of the poor wee bannock . and if a moral be wanted for this tale , here it is : that people should never be too uplifted or too cast down over anything , for all the good folk in the story thought that they were going to get the bannock , and , lo and behold ! the fox got it after all .
