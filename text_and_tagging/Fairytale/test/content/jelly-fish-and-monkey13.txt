" i have got him at last ! " thought the jelly fish , but aloud he said : " mr . monkey . i must now go back . as you have never seen the palace of the dragon king , wo n't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me ? i shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea , which will be even more wonderful to you - a land - lubber . " " i should love to go , " said the monkey , " but how am i to cross the water ! i ca n't swim , as you surely know ! " " there is no difficulty about that . i can carry you on my back . " " that will be troubling you too much , " said the monkey . " i can do it quite easily . i am stronger than i look , so you need n't hesitate , " said the jelly fish , and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea . " keep very still , mr . monkey , " said the jelly fish . " you must n't fall into the sea ; i am responsible for your safe arrival at the king 's palace . " " please do n't go so fast , or i am sure i shall fall off , " said the monkey .
