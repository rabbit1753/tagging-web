mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race , and took his place among them . many good beasts were there which had won many races , but the horse of the fisher 's son left them all behind , and he was first at the winning post . the king 's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize , for he went back to the wood , and got off his horse , and put on his old clothes , and bade the box place some gold in his pockets . after that he went back to the weaver 's house , and told him that the gold had been given him by the man who had won the race , and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him . now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess , the king ordered another race to be run , and the fisher 's son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before , and easily distanced everybody else . but again he left the prize unclaimed , and so it happened on the third day , when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were gathered to see the race , for they were filled with curiosity to know who the winner could be .
