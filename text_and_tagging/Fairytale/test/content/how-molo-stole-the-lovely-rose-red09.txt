and after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said : " the dog is dead , and there is nothing further to hinder us ! " at midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk , and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace . they reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar . then they saw the glow of a little lamp , and heard rose - red sigh deeply . the entire court was silent and deserted . the youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room . long and searchingly rose - red looked at him , then seized his hand . " i knew that you were intelligent , and would understand my sign language . but what magic power have you at your disposal , that you were able to get here ? " the youth told her in detail how molo had helped him . " and where is molo ? " she asked . " outside , before the curtain , " was his answer . then she called him in and gave him wine to drink from a jade goblet and said : " i am of good family and have come here from far away . force alone has made me a slave in this palace . i long to leave it . for though i have jasper chop - sticks with which to eat , and drink my wine from golden flagons , though silk and satin rustle around me and jewels of every kind are at my disposal , all these are but so many chains and fetters to hold me here . dear molo , you are endowed with magic powers . i beg you to save me in my distress ! if you do , i will be glad to serve your master as a slave , and will never forget the favor you do me .
