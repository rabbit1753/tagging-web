the poor jelly fish , humiliated and horrified beyond all words , cried out for pardon . but the dragon king 's order had to be obeyed . the servants of the palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish , and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp , and then took him out beyond the palace gates and threw him into the water . here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering , and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness . from this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise , but , ever since the dragon king 's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes , his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to - day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of japan .
