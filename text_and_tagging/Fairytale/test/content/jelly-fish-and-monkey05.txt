" do you mean to tell me that you ca n't get the medicine here ? " asked the dragon king . " it is just as you say ! " said the doctor . " tell me what it is you want for the queen ? " demanded rin jin . " i want the liver of a live monkey ! " answered the doctor . " the liver of a live monkey ! of course that will be most difficult to get , " said the king . " if we could only get that for the queen , her majesty would soon recover , " said the doctor . " very well , that decides it ; we must get it somehow or other . but where are we most likely to find a monkey ? " asked the king .
