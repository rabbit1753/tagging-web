the happy hunter felt that he was to blame for all that had come to pass , and bore his brother 's scornful scolding with humility and patience . he hunted everywhere for the hook most diligently , but it was nowhere to be found . he was at last obliged to give up all hope of finding it . he then went home , and in desperation broke his beloved sword into pieces and made five hundred hooks out of it . he took these to his angry brother and offered them to him , asking his forgiveness , and begging him to accept them in the place of the one he had lost for him . it was useless ; his brother would not listen to him , much less grant his request . the happy hunter then made another five hundred hooks , and again took them to his brother , beseeching him to pardon him . " though you make a million hooks , " said the skillful fisher , shaking his head , " they are of no use to me . i can not forgive you unless you bring me back my own hook . "
