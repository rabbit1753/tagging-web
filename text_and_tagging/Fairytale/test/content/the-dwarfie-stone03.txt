but all the time they never guessed the real reason why snorro chose to live in the dwarfie stone . i will tell you why he did so . not very far from the stone there was a curious hill , shaped exactly like a wart . it was known as the wart hill of hoy , and men said that somewhere in the side of it was hidden a wonderful carbuncle , which , when it was found , would bestow on its finder marvellous magic gifts -- health , wealth , and happiness . everything , in fact , that a human being could desire . and the curious thing about this carbuncle was , that it was said that it could be seen at certain times , if only the people who were looking for it were at the right spot at the right moment . now snorro had made up his mind that he would find this wonderful stone , so , while he pretended to spend all his time in reading his great book or distilling medicines from his herbs , he was really keeping a keen look - out during his wanderings , noting every tuft of grass or piece of rock under which it might be hidden . and at night , when everyone else was asleep , he would creep out , with pickaxe and spade , to turn over the rocks or dig over the turf , in the hope of finding the long - sought - for treasure underneath them .
