then he awoke , and the dark lad told him what had befallen him , and he was very grieved . but the dark lad did not tell him of the name that was written underneath his arm . on the following morning the fisher 's son again went to the church , determined that he would not go to sleep , whatever happened . but in his hurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt , and sank down where he stood , wrapped in slumber . a second time the air was filled with music , and the lady came in , stepping softly , but though she laid his head on her knee , and combed his hair with a golden comb , his eyes opened not . then she burst into tears , and placing a beautifully wrought box in his pocket she went her way . the next day the same thing befell the fisher 's son , and this time the lady wept more bitterly than before , for she said it was the last chance , and she would never be allowed to come any more , for home she must go .
