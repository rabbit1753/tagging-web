" nothing easier , " said molo . " on the fifteenth we will take two pieces of dark silk and wrap ourselves up in them , and thus i will carry you there . yet there is a wild dog on guard at the slave girl 's court , who is strong as a tiger and watchful as a god . no one can pass by him , so he must be killed . " when the appointed day had come , the servant said : " there is no one else in the world who can kill this dog but myself ! " full of joy the youth gave him meat and wine , and the old man took a chain - hammer and disappeared with it . and after no more time had elapsed than it takes to eat a meal he was back again and said : " the dog is dead , and there is nothing further to hinder us ! " at midnight they wrapped themselves in dark silk , and the old man carried the youth over the tenfold walls which surrounded the palace . they reached the third gateway and the gate stood ajar . then they saw the glow of a little lamp , and heard rose - red sigh deeply . the entire court was silent and deserted . the youth raised the curtain and stepped into the room . long and searchingly rose - red looked at him , then seized his hand . " i knew that you were intelligent , and would understand my sign language . but what magic power have you at your disposal , that you were able to get here ? "
