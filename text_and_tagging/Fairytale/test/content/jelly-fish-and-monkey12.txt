" well , " said the chief steward , " if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never catch a monkey . the only way is to play a trick on one ! " " how can i play a trick on a monkey ? i do n't know how to do it , " said the perplexed jelly fish . " this is what you must do , " said the wily chief steward . " when you approach the island of monkeys and meet some of them , you must try to get very friendly with one . tell him that you are a servant of the dragon king , and invite him to come and visit you and see the dragon king 's palace . try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the palace and the wonders of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all ! " " but how am i to get the monkey here ? you know monkeys do n't swim ? " said the reluctant jelly fish . " you must carry him on your back . what is the use of your shell if you ca n't do that ! " said the chief steward . " wo n't he be very heavy ? " queried kurage again . " you must n't mind that , for you are working for the dragon king , " replied the chief steward . " i will do my best then , " said the jelly fish , and he swam away from the palace and started off towards the monkey island . swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours , and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore . on looking round he saw not far away a big pine - tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking for - a live monkey . " i have got him at last ! " thought the jelly fish , but aloud he said : " mr . monkey . i must now go back . as you have never seen the palace of the dragon king , wo n't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me ? i shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea , which will be even more wonderful to you - a land - lubber . " " i should love to go , " said the monkey , " but how am i to cross the water ! i ca n't swim , as you surely know ! " " there is no difficulty about that . i can carry you on my back . " " that will be troubling you too much , " said the monkey . " i can do it quite easily . i am stronger than i look , so you need n't hesitate , " said the jelly fish , and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea . " keep very still , mr . monkey , " said the jelly fish . " you must n't fall into the sea ; i am responsible for your safe arrival at the king 's palace . " " please do n't go so fast , or i am sure i shall fall off , " said the monkey .
