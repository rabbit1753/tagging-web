one day the happy hunter came to his brother , the skillful fisher , and said : " well , my brother , i see you go to the sea every day with your fishing rod in your hand , and when you return you come laden with fish . and as for me , it is my pleasure to take my bow and arrow and to hunt the wild animals up the mountains and down in the valleys . for a long time we have each followed our favorite occupation , so that now we must both be tired , you of your fishing and i of my hunting . would it not be wise for us to make a change ? will you try hunting in the mountains and i will go and fish in the sea ? " the skillful fisher listened in silence to his brother , and for a moment was thoughtful , but at last he answered : " o yes , why not ? your idea is not a bad one at all . give me your bow and arrow and i will set out at once for the mountains and hunt for game .
