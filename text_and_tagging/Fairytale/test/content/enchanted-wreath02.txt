one day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood . they worked hard all day , but in spite of the chopping they were very cold , for it rained heavily , and when they returned home , they were wet through . then , to his vexation , the man found that he had left his axe behind him , and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless . so he said to his wife : ' i have dropped my axe in the forest , bid your daughter go and fetch it , for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary . '
