" and then turning to her younger sister , she said : " do you not think so , tamayori ? " " yes , indeed , " answered the princess tamayori , in her sweet voice . " as you say , we can know no greater honor than to welcome the mikoto to our home . " " then i ask you to be so kind as to lead the way , " said the happy hunter . " condescend to enter , mikoto ( augustness ) , " said both the sisters , and bowing low , they led him through the gate .
