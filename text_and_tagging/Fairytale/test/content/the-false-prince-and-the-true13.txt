one night the prince returned after a longer chase than usual , and he was so tired that he went up straight to bed . suddenly he was awakened by a strange noise in the room , and suspecting that a robber might have stolen in , he jumped out of bed , and seized his sword , which lay ready to his hand . then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the next room , which belonged to the princess , and was lighted by a burning torch . creeping softly to the door , he peeped through it , and beheld her lying quietly , with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head , her wrinkles all gone , and her face , which was whiter than the snow , as fresh as that of a girl of fourteen . could that really be his wife -- that beautiful , beautiful creature ? the prince was still gazing in surprise when the lady opened her eyes and smiled at him . ' yes , i really am your wife , ' she said , as if she had guessed his thoughts , ' and the enchantment is ended . now i must tell you who i am , and what befell to cause me to take the shape of an old woman .
