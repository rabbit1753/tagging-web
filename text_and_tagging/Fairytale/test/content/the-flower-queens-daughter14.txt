' ' over there , at the edge of the forest in the little hut you see in the distance , ' replied the old woman . the prince lifted her on to his horse , and soon they reached the hut , where the old woman got down , and turning to the prince said , ' just wait a moment , and i will give you something . ' and she disappeared into her hut , but returned very soon and said , ' you are a mighty prince , but at the same time you have a kind heart , which deserves to be rewarded . would you like to have the most beautiful woman in the world for your wife ? ' ' most certainly i would , ' replied the prince .
