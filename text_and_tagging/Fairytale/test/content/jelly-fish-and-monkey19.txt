the jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered . then he asked the monkey if it was n't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver . the monkey replied laughingly that he could n't afford to lose his liver : it was too precious . " but remember your promise ! " pleaded the jelly fish , now very discouraged . " that promise was false , and anyhow it is now broken ! " answered the monkey . then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time ; that he had no wish to lose his life , which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the sea king 's palace to the old doctor waiting for him , instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses .
