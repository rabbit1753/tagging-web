the oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition , and said amongst themselves : " how badly he dances to - day ! " then to the old man the demon chief said : " your performance to - day is quite different from the dance of yesterday . we do n't wish to see any more of such dancing . we will give you back the pledge you left with us . you must go away at once . " he put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were not dreaming a horrible nightmare . no , sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side of his face as on the left . the demons had all disappeared , and there was nothing for him to do but to return home . he was a pitiful sight , for his face , with the two large lumps , one on each side , looked just like a japanese gourd .
