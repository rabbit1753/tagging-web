the old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain began to fall heavily . he looked about for some shelter , but there was not even a charcoal - burner 's hut near . at last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree . the hole was near the ground , so he crept in easily , and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain shower , and that the weather would soon clear .
