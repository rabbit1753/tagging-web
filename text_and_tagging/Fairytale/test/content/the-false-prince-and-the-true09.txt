' one day , shortly after the death of the queen , ' continued the young man , ' your highness was hunting , and outstripped all your attendants while chasing the deer . you were in a part of the country which you did not know , so seeing an orchard all pink and white with apple - blossoms , and a girl tossing a ball in one corner , you went up to her to ask your way . but when she turned to answer you , you were so struck with her beauty that all else fled from your mind . again and again you rode back to see her , and at length persuaded her to marry you . she only thought you a poor knight , and agreed that as you wished it , the marriage should be kept secret . ' ' after the ceremony you gave her three rings and a charm with a cross on it , and then put her in a cottage in the forest , thinking to hide the matter securely . ' ' for some months you visited the cottage every week ; but a rebellion broke out in a distant part of the kingdom , and called for your presence . when next you rode up to the cottage , it was empty , and none could inform you whither your bride had gone . that , sire , i can now tell you , ' and the young man paused and looked at the king , who coloured deeply . ' she went back to her father the old duke , once your chamberlain , and the cross on her breast revealed at once who you were . fierce was his anger when he heard his daughter 's tale , and he vowed that he would hide her safely from you , till the day when you would claim her publicly as your queen .
