at the time when the tang dynasty reigned over the middle kingdom , there were master swordsmen of various kinds . those who came first were the saints of the sword . they were able to take different shapes at will , and their swords were like strokes of lightning . before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen . yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind , and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world . the second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes . it was their custom to slay the unjust , and to come to the aid of the oppressed . they wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt . by magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water . they could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls , and they came and went and left no trace . the swordsmen of the lowest sort were the mere bought slayers . they hired themselves out to those who wished to do away with their enemies . and death was an everyday matter to them .
