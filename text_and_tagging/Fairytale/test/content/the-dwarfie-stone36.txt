his vengeance was baulked , however , for in the panic and confusion that followed harold 's death , the two countesses slipped out of the palace and fled to the coast , and took boat in haste to scotland , where they had great possessions , and where they were much looked up to , and where no one would believe a word against them . but retribution fell on them in the end , as it always does fall , sooner or later , on everyone who is wicked , or selfish , or cruel ; for the norsemen invaded the land , and their castle was set on fire , and they perished miserably in the flames . when earl paul found that they had escaped , he set out in hot haste for the island of hoy , for he was determined that the dwarf , at least , should not escape . but when he came to the dwarfie stone he found it silent and deserted , all trace of its uncanny occupants having disappeared .
