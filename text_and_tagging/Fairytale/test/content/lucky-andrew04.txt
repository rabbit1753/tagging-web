but his brother complained of being weary , and at length they decided to remain there for the night . when andrew awoke he found himself alone ; and he saw neither brother nor boat , until he came to the highest point of the island . then he discovered him far out , darting for land like a sea - gull . andrew did not understand the whole affair . there were still provisions there , as well as a dish of curd , his gun and various other things . so andrew wasted but little time in thought . " he will come back this evening , " said he . " only a fool loses heart so long as he can eat . " but in the evening there was no brother to be seen , and andrew waited day by day , and week by week ; until at last , he realized that his brother had marooned him on this barren island in order to be able to keep their inheritance for himself , and not have to divide it . and such was the case , for when john nicholas came in sight of land on his homeward trip , he had capsized the boat , and declared that lucky andrew had been drowned .
