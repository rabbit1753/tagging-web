when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head . ' ' how did you get the ring which was in the soup ? ' he asked . ' i know nothing at all about the ring , ' she answered . so the king could find out nothing , and was obliged to send her away . after a time there was another feast , and the many - furred creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on . he answered , ' yes , but come back again in half - an - hour and cook the king the bread - soup that he likes so much . ' so she ran away to her little room , washed herself quickly , took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on . then she went upstairs looking just like a king 's daughter , and the king came towards her , delighted to see her again , and as the dance had just begun , they danced together .
