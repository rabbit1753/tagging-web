" yes , and i 'm sure it is because you have the jacket , poor fellow ! " said the boy . but when he looked more closely , there was a chest full of bright silver coins under the stone . " that must be stolen money , " thought the boy , " for no one lays money honestly earned under stones in the wood . " and he took the chest , and carried it down to the pond nearby , and threw in the whole pile of money . but a four - shilling piece was left swimming on the top of the water . " well , this one is honest , for whatever is honest will float , " said the boy . and he took the four - shilling piece and the jacket home with him . he told his mother what had happened to him , that the stone had turned around , and that he had found a chest full of silver coins , and had thrown it into the pond because it was stolen money . " but a four - shilling piece floated , and that i took along , because it was honest , " said the boy . " you are a fool , " said the woman -- for she was as angry as could be--"if nothing were honest save what floats on the water , there would be but little honesty left in the world . and if the money had been stolen ten times over , still you had found it , and charity begins at home . if you had kept the money , we might have passed the rest of our lives in peace and comfort . but you are a dunderhead and will stay a dunderhead , and i wo n't be tormented and burdened with you any longer . now you must get out and earn your own living .
