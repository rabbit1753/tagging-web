on they went , on and on and one , till they reached a cottage which was thatched with heather . with a bound the deer sprang on the roof , and lay down where none could see her , but as she did so she called out , ' go in , fisher 's son , and eat and drink while you may . ' so he entered and found food and wine on the table , but no man , for the house belonged to some robbers , who were still away at their wicked business . after ian , the fisher 's son , had eaten all he wanted , he hid himself behind a great cask , and very soon he heard a noise , as of men coming through the heather , and the small twigs snapping under their feet . from his dark corner he could see into the room , and he counted four and twenty of them , all big , cross - looking men . ' some one has been eating our dinner , ' cried they , ' and there was hardly enough for ourselves . '
