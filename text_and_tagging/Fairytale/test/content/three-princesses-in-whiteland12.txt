then the king thanked him , and did as he said . " why do you stand there fighting till the end of time ? " said he to the brothers . " let me test your possessions if i am to decide your quarrel . " that suited them ; but when he had hat , cloak and boots , he told them : " i will give you my decision the next time we meet ! " and with that he wished himself far away . while he was flying through the air he happened to meet the north wind . " and where are you going ? " asked the north wind . " to whiteland , " said the king , and then he told him what had happened to him . " well , " said the north wind , " you are traveling a little quicker than i am ; for i must sweep and blow out every corner . but when you come to your journey 's end , stand on the steps beside the door , and then i 'll tt . and when the prince who is to have the queen comes and looks out to see what it all means , i 'll just take him along with me .
