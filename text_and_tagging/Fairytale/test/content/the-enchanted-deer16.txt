' there is to be a horse - race in the town to - day , ' remarked the weaver , ' and the winner is to have the king 's daughter to wife . ' the young man trembled with excitement at the news , and his voice shook as he answered : ' that will be a prize indeed , i should like to see the race . ' ' oh , that is quite easy -- anyone can go , ' replied the weaver . ' i would take you myself , but i have promised to weave this cloth for the king . '
