but after her mother had gone , she found so many berries that she forgot to say her verse , and so she was enchanted and taken into the hill . and there no harm had been done her , save that she had lost the top joint of the little finger of her left hand , and the goblins had been kind to her ; yet it had always seemed to her as though something were not as it should be , she felt as though something weighed upon her , and she had suffered greatly from the advances of the dwarf who had been chosen for her husband . when andrew learned who her mother and her people were , he saw that they were related to him , and they became very good friends . so andrew could truly say he had been born under a lucky star . then they sailed home , and took along the schooner , and all the gold and silver , and all the treasure which had been left in the hut , and then andrew was far wealthier than his brother .
