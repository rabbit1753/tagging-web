on the third day the prince led the mare to the meadow again ; but once more she vanished before his eyes . then the prince took out his little bell and rang it three times . in a moment the king of the fishes appeared , and said to him : ' i know quite well what you want me to do , and i will summon all the fishes of the sea together , and tell them to bring you back the mare , who is hiding herself in a river . ' towards evening the mare was returned to him , and when he led her home to the mother dragon she said to him : ' you are a brave youth , and i will make you my body - servant . but what shall i give you as a reward to begin with ? ' the prince begged for a foal of the mare , which the mother dragon at once gave him , and over and above , a cloak made of gold , for she had fallen in love with him because he had praised her beauty .
