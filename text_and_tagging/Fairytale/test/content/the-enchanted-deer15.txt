' bear me to the kingdom of the king under the waves , ' he answered , and one little bird flew on to his head , and the others perched on each of his shoulders , and he shut his eyes , and in a moment there he was in the country under the sea . then the birds flew away , and the young man looked about him , his heart beating fast at the thought that here dwelt the lady whom he had sought all the world over . he walked on through the streets , and presently he reached the house of a weaver who was standing at his door , resting from his work . ' you are a stranger here , that is plain , ' said the weaver , ' but come in , and i will give you food and drink . ' and the young man was glad , for he knew not where to go , and they sat and talked till it grew late .
