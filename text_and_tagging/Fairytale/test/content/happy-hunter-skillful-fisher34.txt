" are you indeed ryn jin , the king of the sea , of whom i have so often heard ? " answered the happy hunter , saluting his host most ceremoniously . " i must apologize for all the trouble i am giving you by my unexpected visit . " and he bowed again , and thanked the sea king . " you need not thank me , " said ryn jin . " it is i who must thank you for coming . although the sea palace is a poor place , as you see , i shall be highly honored if you will make us a long visit . "
