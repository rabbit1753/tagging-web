' sir , ' she said , ' i know all that has happened to you , and how you are seeking if in any wise you can save your life . but there is none that can answer that question save only i myself , if you will promise to do all i ask . ' at her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled off him . ' oh , save me , and i will do anything ! ' he cried . ' it is so hard to leave the world and go out into the darkness . ' ' you will not need to do that , ' answered the old woman , ' you have only got to marry me , and you will soon be free . ' ' marry you ? ' exclaimed he , ' but -- but -- i am not yet twenty , and you --why , you must be a hundred at least ! oh , no , it is quite impossible . ' he spoke without thinking , but the flash of anger which darted from her eyes made him feel uncomfortable . however , all she said was : ' as you like ; since you reject me , let the crows have you , ' and hurried away down the street . left to himself , the full horror of his coming death rushed upon the young man , and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance of life . well , if he must , he must , he said to himself , and began to run as fast as he could after the old crone , who by this time could scarcely be seen , even in the moonlight . who would have believed a woman past ninety could walk with such speed ? it seemed more like flying ! but at length , breathless and exhausted , he reached her side , and gasped out : ' madam , pardon me for my hasty words just now ; i was wrong , and will thankfully accept the offer you made me . ' ' ah , i thought you would come to your senses , ' answered she , in rather an odd voice . ' we have no time to lose -- follow me at once , ' and they went on silently and swiftly till they stopped at the door of a small house in which the priest lived . before him the old woman bade the prisoner swear that she should be his wife , and this he did in the presence of witnesses . then , begging the priest and the guards to leave them alone for a little , she told the young man what he was to do , when the next morning he was brought before the king and the judges .
