" eating is hard work in this country , " said the merchant . " how is it the folk here have no cats ? " " cats ? " said the people : they did not know what they were . then the merchant had the cat that he had bought for the scullion brought , and when the cat went over the table , the mice had to hurry into their holes , and not in the memory of man had the people been able to eat in such comfort . then they begged and implored the merchant to sell them his cat . at last he said he would let them have her ; but he wanted a hundred dollars for her , and this they paid , and thanked him kindly into the bargain .
