now when the merchant had discharged his cargo in foreign parts and had reloaded , and had bought what his servants had desired , he went back to his ship , and was about to shove off . not until then did he remember that the scullion had given him a four - shilling piece , with which to buy him something . " must i go up to the city again because of this four - shilling piece ? one only has one 's troubles when one bothers with such truck , " thought the merchant . then along came a woman with a bag on her back . " what have you in your bag , granny ? " asked the merchant . " o , it is only a cat ! i can feed her no longer , and so i want to throw her into the sea in order to get rid of her , " said the old woman . " the boy told me to buy whatever i could get for the four - shilling piece , " said the merchant to himself , and asked the woman whether he could have her cat for four shillings . the woman agreed without delay , and the bargain was closed .
