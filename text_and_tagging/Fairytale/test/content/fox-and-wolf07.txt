as soon as he understood what was happening , the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf , but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him . ' but where is the cheese ? ' he asked of the fox , who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile . ' the cheese ? ' answered the fox ; ' why i am taking it home to my babies , who are too young to get food for themselves . ' ' ah , traitor ! ' cried the wolf , howling with rage . but the fox was not there to hear this insult , for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl - house , where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before . ' perhaps i did treat him rather badly , ' she said to herself . ' but it seems getting cloudy , and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom , and his will go up - at least it may ! '
