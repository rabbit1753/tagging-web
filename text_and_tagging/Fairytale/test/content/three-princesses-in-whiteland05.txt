" now you must go to the castle , and let the trolls whip you one night through for each one of us , " said she , " and if you can hold out , you will have delivered us . " " yes , " said the youth , he could manage that . " when you go in , " added the princess , " you will find two lions standing by the door ; but if you pass directly between them , they will do you no harm . go on into a dark little room and lie down , and then the troll will come and beat you ; but after that you must take the bottle that hangs on the wall , and anoint yourself where he has beaten you , and you will be whole again . and take the sword that hangs beside the bottle , and kill the troll with it . " he did as the princess had told him , passed between the lions as though he did not see them , and right into the little room , where he lay down . the first night a troll with three heads and three whips came , and beat the youth badly ; but he held out , and when the troll had finished , he took the bottle and anointed himself , grasped the sword and killed the troll . when he came out in the morning the princesses were out of the ground up to their waists . the next night it was the same ; but the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips , and beat him worse than the first one .
