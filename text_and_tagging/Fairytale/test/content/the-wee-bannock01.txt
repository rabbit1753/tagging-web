there was once an old man and his wife , who lived in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn . they were a very canty and contented couple , for they had enough to live on , and enough to do . indeed , they considered themselves quite rich , for , besides their cottage and their garden , they possessed two sleek cows , five hens and a cock , an old cat , and two kittens . the old man spent his time looking after the cows , and the hens , and the garden ; while the old woman kept herself busy spinning . one day , just after breakfast , the old woman thought that she would like an oatmeal bannock for her supper that evening , so she took down her bakeboard , and put on her girdle , and baked a couple of fine cakes , and when they were ready she put them down before the fire to harden .
