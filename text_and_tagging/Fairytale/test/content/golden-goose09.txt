then dullhead asked once more for his bride , but the king felt vexed at the idea of a stupid fellow whom people called ' dullhead ' carrying off his daughter , and he began to make fresh conditions . he required dullhead to find a man who could eat a mountain of bread . dullhead did not wait to consider long but went straight off to the forest , and there on the same spot sat a man who was drawing in a strap as tight as he could round his body , and making a most woeful face the while . said he : ' i 've eaten up a whole oven full of loaves , but what 's the good of that to anyone who is as hungry as i am ? i declare my stomach feels quite empty , and i must draw my belt tight if i 'm not to die of starvation . ' dullhead was delighted , and said : ' get up and come with me , and you shall have plenty to eat , ' and he brought him to the king 's court .
