the cuttlefish now came forward , and said to the king : " what i said was right . you see the hook still sticks in the tai 's throat . i hope to be able to pull it out in the presence of the mikoto , and then we can return it to him safely ! " " o please make haste and pull it out ! " cried the tai , pitifully , for he felt the pains in his throat coming on again ; " i do so want to return the hook to the mikoto . " " all right , tai san , " said his friend the cuttlefish , and then opening the tai 's mouth as wide as he could and putting one of his feelers down the tai 's throat , he quickly and easily drew the hook out of the sufferer 's large mouth . he then washed it and brought it to the king .
