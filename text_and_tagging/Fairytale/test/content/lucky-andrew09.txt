the fiddler knew neither rest nor repose , and did not pass his cap , but played merrily on with his left hand , and beat time with his foot , until he was dripping with sweat , and the fiddle was hidden by the dust and smoke . when andrew noticed that his own feet began to twitch where he was standing , he thought to himself : " now i had better shoot away , or else he will play me right off the ground ! " so he turned his gun , thrust it through the window , and shot it off over the bride 's head ; but upside down , otherwise the bullet would have hit him . the moment the shot crashed , all the troll - folk tumbled out of the door together ; but when they saw that the schooner was banned on the shore , they wailed and crept into a hole in the hill . but all the gold and silver dishes were left behind , and the bride , too , was still sitting there . she told lucky andrew that she had been carried into the hill when she was only a small child . once , when her mother had gone to the pen to attend to the milking , she had taken her along ; but when she had to go home for a moment , she left the child sitting under a juniper - bush , and told her that she might eat the berries if she only repeated three times : " i eat juniper - berries blue , wherein jesu 's cross i view . i eat whortle - berries red , since ' twas for my sake he bled !
