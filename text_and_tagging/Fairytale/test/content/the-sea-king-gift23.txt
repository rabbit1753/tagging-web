both rose . the summer night was as dark as if it had been october , the weather - cock creaked , and the storm was raging in every direction . as they went out the sea lay around them as white as now , and the spray was dashing right over the fisher - hut . in all his life matte had never remembered such a night . to launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the net was a thing not to be thought of . the fisherman and his wife stood aghast on the doorstep , holding on fast by the doorpost , while the foam splashed over their faces . ' did i not tell thee that there is no luck in sunday fishing ? ' said matte sulkily ; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of ahti 's cows . as there was nothing to be done , they went in . their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber , and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling . when they awoke , the sun was high in the heavens , the tempest had cased , and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock . ' it is all very fine to possess a cow , ' said matte , as he cleaned the fish ; ' but what are we going to feed her on ? ' ' we shall find some means , ' said his wife ; and the cow found the means herself . she went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore , and always kept in good condition . every one prince alone excepted , thought she was a clever beast ; but prince barked at her , for he had now got a rival . from that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets , and every net was filled with fish . matte and maie grew fat on this fine living , and daily became richer . she churned quantities of butter , and he hired two men to help him in his fishing . the sea lay before him like a big fish tank , out of which he hauled as many as he required ; and the cow continued to fend for herself . in autumn , when matte and maie went ashore , the cow went to sea , and in spring , when they returned to the rock , there she stood awaiting them .
