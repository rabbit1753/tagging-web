' that is a pity , ' returned the young man politely , but in his heart he rejoiced , for he wished to be alone . leaving the house , he entered a grove of trees which stood behind , and took the box from his pocket . he raised the lid , and out flew the three little birds . ' good master , what shall we do for thee ? ' asked they , and he answered , ' bring me the finest horse that ever was seen , and the grandest dress , and glass shoes . ' ' they are here , master , ' said the birds , and so they were , and never had the young man seen anything so splendid . mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race , and took his place among them . many good beasts were there which had won many races , but the horse of the fisher 's son left them all behind , and he was first at the winning post . the king 's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize , for he went back to the wood , and got off his horse , and put on his old clothes , and bade the box place some gold in his pockets . after that he went back to the weaver 's house , and told him that the gold had been given him by the man who had won the race , and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him . now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess , the king ordered another race to be run , and the fisher 's son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before , and easily distanced everybody else . but again he left the prize unclaimed , and so it happened on the third day , when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were gathered to see the race , for they were filled with curiosity to know who the winner could be .
