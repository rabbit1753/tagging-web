' here i must leave you , ' said the deer , ' but to - morrow meet me at midday in the church that is yonder . ' and jumping across the stream , she vanished into a wood . next day he set out for the church , but the old woman of the cottage had gone before him , and had stuck an enchanted stick called ' the spike of hurt ' in a crack of the door , so that he would brush against it as he stepped across the threshold . suddenly he felt so sleepy that he could not stand up , and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deep slumber , not knowing that the dark lad was watching him . nothing could waken him , not even the sound of sweetest music , nor the touch of a lady who bent over him . a sad look came on her face , as she saw it was no use , and at last she gave it up , and lifting his arm , wrote her name across the side--'the daughter of the king of the town under the waves . ' ' i will come to - morrow , ' she whispered , though he could not hear her , and she went sorrowfully away .
