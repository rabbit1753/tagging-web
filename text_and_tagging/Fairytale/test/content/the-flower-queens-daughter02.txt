a young prince was riding one day through a meadow that stretched for miles in front of him , when he came to a deep open ditch . he was turning aside to avoid it , when he heard the sound of someone crying in the ditch . he dismounted from his horse , and stepped along in the direction the sound came from . to his astonishment he found an old woman , who begged him to help her out of the ditch . the prince bent down and lifted her out of her living grave , asking her at the same time how she had managed to get there . ' my son , ' answered the old woman , ' i am a very poor woman , and soon after midnight i set out for the neighbouring town in order to sell my eggs in the market on the following morning ; but i lost my way in the dark , and fell into this deep ditch , where i might have remained for ever but for your kindness .
