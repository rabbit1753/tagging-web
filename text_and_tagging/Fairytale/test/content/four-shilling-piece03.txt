so the boy had to go out into the wide world , and wandered about far and near looking for service . but wherever he went people found him too small or too weak , and said that they could make no use of him . at last he came to a merchant . there they kept him to work in the kitchen , and he had to fetch wood and water for the cook . when he had been there for some time , the merchant decided to journey to far countries , and asked all his servants what he should buy and bring back home for them . after all had told him what they wanted , came the turn of the little fellow who carried wood and water for the kitchen . he handed him his four - shilling piece . " well , and what am i to buy for it ? " asked the merchant . " it will not be a large purchase . " " buy whatever it will bring , it is honest money , that i know , " said the boy . his master promised to do so , and sailed away .
