all was silent in the village , and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon , which shone bright and clear in the sky . the wolf and the fox crept softly along , when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other ; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses , and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs , who began to bark greedily . ' is it safe to go on , think you ? ' asked the wolf in a whisper . and the fox shook her head . ' not while the dogs are barking , ' said she ; ' someone might come out to see if anything was the matter . ' and she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her . in about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking , or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them . then the wolf and the fox jumped up , and hastened to the foot of the wall .
