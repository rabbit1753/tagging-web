this time it ran up a burnside till it came to a little cottage standing among the heather . here the goodwife was making porridge for the supper in a pot over the fire , and her husband was sitting in a corner plaiting ropes of straw with which to tie up the cow . " oh , jock ! come here , come here , " cried the goodwife . " you are crying for a little bannock for your supper ; come here , histie , quick , and help me to catch it . " " ay , ay , " assented jock , jumping to his feet and hurrying across the little room . " but where is it ? i can not see it . " " there , man , there , " cried his wife , " under that chair . run thou to that side ; i will keep to this . " so jock ran into the dark corner behind the chair ; but , in his hurry , he tripped and fell , and the wee bannock jumped over him and flew laughing out at the door . through the whins and up the hillside it ran , and over the top of the hill , to a shepherd 's cottage on the other side . the inmates were just sitting down to their porridge , and the goodwife was scraping the pan . " save us and help us , " she exclaimed , stopping with the spoon half - way to her mouth . " there 's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our fireside . " " sneck the door , " cried the husband , " and we 'll try to catch it . it would come in handy after the porridge . "
