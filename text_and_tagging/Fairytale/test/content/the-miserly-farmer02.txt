the bystanders told the farmer that he ought to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go . but the farmer would not and did not . an artisan saw the whole affair from his shop , and since the noise annoyed him , he took some money , bought a pear and gave it to the bonze . the bonze thanked him and said : " one like myself , who has given up the world , must not be miserly . i have beautiful pears myself , and i invite you all to eat them with me . " then some one asked : " if you have pears then why do you not eat your own ? " he answered : " i first must have a seed to plant . "
