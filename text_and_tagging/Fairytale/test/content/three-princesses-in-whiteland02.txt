but when he got home , he found that heaven had sent him a little son , the first new thing to come into the house since he had made his promise . and when he told his wife about it , she began to weep and wail , and pray to god because of the vow her husband had made . and the woman 's grief was reported at the castle , and when it came to the king 's ears , and he learned the reason , he promised to take the boy and see if he could not save him . and so the king took him and brought him up as though he were his own son , until he was grown . then one day the boy asked whether he might not go out fishing with his father , he wanted to so very much , said he . the king would not hear of it ; but at last he was given permission , so he went to his father , and everything went well all day long , until they came home in the evening .
