while they were toasting , her husband came in from the byre , and sat down to take a rest in his great arm - chair . presently his eyes fell on the bannocks , and , as they looked very good , he broke one through the middle and began to eat it . when the other bannock saw this it determined that it should not have the same fate , so it ran across the kitchen and out of the door as fast as it could . and when the old woman saw it disappearing , she ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her , holding her spindle in one hand and her distaff in the other . but she was old , and the bannock was young , and it ran faster than she did , and escaped over the hill behind the house . it ran , and it ran , and it ran , until it came to a large newly thatched cottage , and , as the door was open , it took refuge inside , and ran right across the floor to a blazing fire , which was burning in the first room that it came to . now , it chanced that this house belonged to a tailor , and he and his two apprentices were sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away with all their might , while the tailor 's wife was sitting beside the fire carding lint . when the wee bannock came trundling across the floor , all three tailors got such a fright that they jumped down from the table and hid behind the master tailor 's wife . " hoot , " she said , " what a set of cowards ye be ! it is but a nice wee bannock . get hold of it and divide it between you , and i 'll fetch you all a drink of milk . "
