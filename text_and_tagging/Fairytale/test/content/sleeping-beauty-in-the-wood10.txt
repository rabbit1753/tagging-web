the old fairy 's turn coming next , with a head shaking more with spite than age , she said that the princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound . this terrible gift made the whole company tremble , and everybody fell a - crying . at this very instant the young fairy came out from behind the hangings , and spake these words aloud : " assure yourselves , o king and queen , that your daughter shall not die of this disaster . it is true , i have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done . the princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle ; but , instead of dying , she shall only fall into a profound sleep , which shall last a hundred years , at the expiration of which a king 's son shall come and awake her .
