i am going to tell you a story about a poor young widow woman , who lived in a house called kittlerumpit , though whereabouts in scotland the house of kittlerumpit stood nobody knows . some folk think that it stood in the neighbourhood of the debateable land , which , as all the world knows , was on the borders , where the old border reivers were constantly coming and going ; the scotch stealing from the english , and the english from the scotch . be that as it may , the widowed mistress of kittlerumpit was sorely to be pitied . for she had lost her husband , and no one quite knew what had become of him . he had gone to a fair one day , and had never come back again , and although everybody believed that he was dead , no one knew how he died . some people said that he had been persuaded to enlist , and had been killed in the wars ; others , that he had been taken away to serve as a sailor by the press - gang , and had been drowned at sea .
