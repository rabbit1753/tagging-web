alas ! alas ! scarce had he gained the hall than he fell to the ground in great pain . everyone crowded round him , and the two countesses , terrified now by what they had done , tried in vain to tear the magic vest from his body . but he felt that it was too late , the deadly poison had done its work , and , waving them aside , he turned to his brother , who , in great distress , had knelt down and taken him tenderly in his arms . " i wronged thee , paul , " he gasped . " for thou hast ever been true and kind . forgive me in thy thoughts , and , " he added , gathering up his strength for one last effort , and pointing to the two wretched women who had wrought all this misery , " _ beware of those two women _ , for they seek to take thy life . " then his head sank back on his brother 's shoulder , and , with one long sigh , he died . when he learned what had happened , and understood where the waistcoat came from , and for what purpose it had been intended , the anger of the silent earl knew no bounds . he swore a great oath that he would be avenged , not only on snorro the dwarf , but also on his wicked step - mother and her cruel sister .
