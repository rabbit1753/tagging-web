' did i not tell thee that there is no luck in sunday fishing ? ' said matte sulkily ; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of ahti 's cows . as there was nothing to be done , they went in . their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber , and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling . when they awoke , the sun was high in the heavens , the tempest had cased , and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock .
