but this clever son replied : ' if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none left for myself ; you just go your own way ; ' and he left the little man standing there and went further on into the forest . there he began to cut down a tree , but before long he made a false stroke with his axe , and cut his own arm so badly that he was obliged to go home and have it bound up . then the second son went to the forest , and his mother gave him a good cake and a bottle of wine as she had to his elder brother . he too met the little old grey man , who begged him for a morsel of cake and a draught of wine . but the second son spoke most sensibly too , and said : ' whatever i give to you i deprive myself of . just go your own way , will you ? ' not long after his punishment overtook him , for no sooner had he struck a couple of blows on a tree with his axe , than he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home .
