so the old woman continued , ' the most beautiful woman in the whole world is the daughter of the queen of the flowers , who has been captured by a dragon . if you wish to marry her , you must first set her free , and this i will help you to do . i will give you this little bell : if you ring it once , the king of the eagles will appear ; if you ring it twice , the king of the foxes will come to you ; and if you ring it three times , you will see the king of the fishes by your side . these will help you if you are in any difficulty . now farewell , and heaven prosper your undertaking . ' she handed him the little bell , and there disappeared hut and all , as though the earth had swallowed her up .
