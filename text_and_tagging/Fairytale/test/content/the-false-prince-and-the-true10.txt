' by and bye i was born , and was brought up by my grandfather in one of his great houses . here are the rings you gave to my mother , and here is the cross , and these will prove if i am your son or not . ' as he spoke the young man laid the jewels at the feet of the king , and the nobles and the judges pressed round to examine them . the king alone did not move from his seat , for he had forgotten the hall of justice and all about him , and saw only the apple - orchard , as it was twenty years ago , and the beautiful girl playing at ball . a sudden silence round him made him look up , and he found the eyes of the assembly fixed on him . ' it is true ; it is he who is my son , and not the other , ' he said with an effort , ' and let every man present swear to acknowledge him as king , after my death . ' therefore one by one they all knelt before him and took the oath , and a message was sent to the false prince , forbidding him ever again to appear at court , though a handsome pension was granted him .
