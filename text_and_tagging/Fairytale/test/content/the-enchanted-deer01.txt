a young man was out walking one day in erin , leading a stout cart - horse by the bridle . he was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his father , who was a fisherman , had been drowned at sea , and wondering what he should do to earn a living for both of them . suddenly a hand was laid on his shoulder , and a voice said to him : ' will you sell me your horse , son of the fisherman ? ' and looking up he beheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand , a falcon on his shoulder , and a dog by his side . ' what will you give me for my horse ? ' asked the youth . ' will you give me your gun , and your dog , and your falcon ? '
