the happy hunter would have liked to enter the gate there and then , but he saw that it was fast closed , and also that there was no one about whom he could ask to open it for him , so he stopped to think what he should do . in the shade of the trees before the gate he noticed a well full of fresh spring water . surely some one would come out to draw water from the well some time , he thought . then he climbed into the tree overhanging the well , and seated himself to rest on one of the branches , and waited for what might happen . ere long he saw the huge gate swing open , and two beautiful women came out . now the mikoto ( augustness ) had always heard that ryn gu was the realm of the dragon king under the sea , and had naturally supposed that the place was inhabited by dragons and similar terrible creatures , so that when he saw these two lovely princesses , whose beauty would be rare even in the world from which he had just come , he was exceedingly surprised , and wondered what it could mean .
