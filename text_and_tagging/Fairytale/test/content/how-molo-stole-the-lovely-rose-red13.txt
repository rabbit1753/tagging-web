two years passed , and the youth no longer thought of any danger . hence , when the flowers began to bloom in the spring , rose - red went driving in a small wagon outside the city , near the river . and there one of the prince 's servants saw her , and informed his master . the latter sent for the youth , who , since he could not conceal the matter , told him the whole story exactly as it had happened . said the prince : " the whole blame rests on rose - red . i do not reproach you . yet since she is now your wife i will let the whole matter rest . but molo will have to suffer for it ! " so he ordered a hundred armored soldiers , with bows and swords , to surround the house of the youth , and under all circumstances to take molo captive . but molo drew his dagger and flew up the high wall . thence he looked about him like a hawk . the arrows flew as thick as rain , but not one hit him . and in a moment he had disappeared , no one knew where . yet ten years later one of his former master 's servants ran across him in the south , where he was selling medicine . and he looked exactly as he had looked ten years before .
