the widow woman almost cried aloud for joy , for now she had learned the fairy 's secret , and her child was safe . but she dare not , in case the wicked old dame heard her and threw some other spell over her . so she crept softly back to the place where she had left her child ; then , catching him up in her arms , she ran through the wood to her house , laughing , and singing , and tossing him in the air in such a state of delight that , if anyone had met her , they would have been in danger of thinking that she was mad . now this young woman had been a merry - hearted maiden , and would have been merry - hearted still , if , since her marriage , she had not had so much trouble that it had made her grow old and sober - minded before her time ; and she began to think what fun it would be to tease the fairy for a few minutes before she let her know that she had found out her name .
