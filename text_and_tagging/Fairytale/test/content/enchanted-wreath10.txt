things went on like this for some weeks , when , one day , as the king 's son was riding through the forest , he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before . he tied his horse to a tree , and followed where the sound led him , and , to his surprise , he saw before him a beautiful girl chopping wood , with a wreath of pink rose - buds , out of which the singing came . standing in the shelter of a tree , he watched her a long while , and then , hat in hand , he went up and spoke to her . ' fair maiden , who are you , and who gave you that wreath of singing roses ? ' asked he , for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely you never saw them .
