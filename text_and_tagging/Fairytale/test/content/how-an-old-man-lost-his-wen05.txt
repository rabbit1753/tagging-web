but on looking out from the tree , what was his amazement to see , not his friends , but hundreds of demons coming towards the spot . the more he looked , the greater was his astonishment . some of these demons were as large as giants , others had great big eyes out of all proportion to the rest of their bodies , others again had absurdly long noses , and some had such big mouths that they seemed to open from ear to ear . all had horns growing on their foreheads . the old man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree . fortunately for him the demons did not see him , as the tree was in the background . so he picked himself up and crept back into the tree .
