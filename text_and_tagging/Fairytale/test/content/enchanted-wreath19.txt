it was nearly midnight before he returned to the palace , but , instead of entering , he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock . he had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea , and stretched out her arms towards his window . in an instant the prince had seized her hand , and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water - for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her - he held her fast . ' you are my own wife , and i shall never let you go , ' he said . but the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw . then the hare changed into a fish , and the fish into a bird , and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake . this time the prince 's hand nearly opened of itself , but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut , and drawing his sword cut off its head , when the spell was broken , and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first , the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy .
