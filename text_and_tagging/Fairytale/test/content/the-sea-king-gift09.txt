matte did not understand . he had never read kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old , but the students proceeded to explain to him . ' ahti , ' said they , ' is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of ahtola , and has a rock at the bottom of the sea , and possesses besides a treasury of good things . he rules over all fish and animals of the deep ; he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom of the ocean . he who stands well with ahti is soon a rich man , but one must beware in dealing with him , for he is very changeful and touchy . even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him , and then as he takes back his gift , he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths . ahti owns also the fairest maidens , who bear the train of his queen wellamos , and at the sound of music they comb their long , flowing locks , which glisten in the water . ' ' oh ! ' cried matte , ' have your worships really seen all that ? ' ' we have as good as seen it , ' said the students . ' it is all printed in a book , and everything printed is true . ' ' i 'm not so sure of that , ' said matte , as he shook his head .
