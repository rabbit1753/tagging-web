when their father died , both of them were of age , and not long after they both had to go out to the sand - banks to fetch some fishing - nets , which had been left there since the summer fishing . it was late in the fall , after the time when most fishermen are busy with the summer fishing . andrew had his gun along , which he carried with him wherever he went . john nicholas did not say much while they were underway ; but he thought all the harder . they were not ready to set out for home again until near evening .
