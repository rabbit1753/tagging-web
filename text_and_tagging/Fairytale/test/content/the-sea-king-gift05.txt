maie sighed . she knew well that her husband was right , but she could not give up the idea of a cow . the buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee ; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter , and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them . one day as matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard prince barking , and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it , steering towards the rock . they were students , on a boating excursion , and wanted to get something to eat . ' bring us a junket , good mother , ' cried they to maie . ' ah ! if only i had such a thing ! ' sighed maie . ' a can of fresh milk , then , ' said the students ; ' but it must not be skim . ' ' yes , if only i had it ! ' sighed the old woman , still more deeply . ' what ! have n't you got a cow ? ' maie was silent . this question so struck her to the heart that she could not reply . ' we have no cow , ' matte answered ; ' but we have good smoked herring , and can cook them in a couple of hours . ' ' all right , then , that will do , ' said the students , as they flung themselves down on the rock , while fifty silvery - white herring were turning on the spit in front of the fire . ' what 's the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean ? ' asked one of them . ' ahtola , ' answered the old man . ' well , you should want for nothing when you live in the sea king 's dominion . '
