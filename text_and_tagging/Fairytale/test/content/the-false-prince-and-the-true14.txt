' the king of granada is my father , and i was born in the palace which overlooks the plain of the vega . i was only a few months old when a wicked fairy , who had a spite against my parents , cast a spell over me , bending my back and wrinkling my skin till i looked as if i was a hundred years old , and making me such an object of disgust to everyone , that at length the king ordered my nurse to take my away from the palace . she was the only person who cared about me , and we lived together in this city on a small pension allowed me by the king . ' ' when i was about three an old man arrived at our house , and begged my nurse to let him come in and rest , as he could walk no longer . she saw that he was very ill , so put him to bed and took such care of him that by and bye he was as strong as ever . in gratitude for her goodness to him , he told her that he was a wizard and could give her anything she chose to ask for , except life or death , so she answered that what she longed for most in the world was that my wrinkled skin should disappear , and that i should regain the beauty with which i was born . to this he replied that as my misfortune resulted from a spell , this was rather difficult , but he would do his best , and at any rate he could promise that before my fifteenth birthday i should be freed from the enchantment if i could get a man who would swear to marry me as i was .
