' no , i do not , ' answered the old man . ' but if you go straight along this road for a year , you will reach a hut where my father lives , and possibly he may be able to tell you . ' the prince thanked him for his information , and continued his journey for a whole year along the same road , and at the end of it came to the little hut , where he found a very old man . he asked him the same question , and the old man answered , ' no , i do not know where the dragon lives . but go straight along this road for another year , and you will come to a hut in which my father lives . i know he can tell you . ' and so the prince wandered on for another year , always on the same road , and at last reached the hut where he found the third old man . he put the same question to him as he had put to his son and grandson ; but this time the old man answered , ' the dragon lives up there on the mountain , and he has just begun his year of sleep . for one whole year he is always awake , and the next he sleeps . but if you wish to see the flower queen 's daughter go up the second mountain : the dragon 's old mother lives there , and she has a ball every night , to which the flower queen 's daughter goes regularly . ' so the prince went up the second mountain , where he found a castle all made of gold with diamond windows . he opened the big gate leading into the courtyard , and was just going to walk in , when seven dragons rushed on him and asked him what he wanted ?
