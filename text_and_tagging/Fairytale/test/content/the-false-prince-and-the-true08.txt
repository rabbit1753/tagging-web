the hall was full to overflowing when the prisoner entered it , and all marvelled at the brightness of his face . the king inquired if he had any excuse to plead for the high treason he had committed by striking the heir to the throne , and , if so , to be quick in setting it forth . with a low bow the youth made answer in a clear voice : ' o my lord and gracious king , and you , nobles and wise men of the land , i leave my cause without fear in your hands , knowing that you will listen and judge rightly , and that you will suffer me to speak to the end , before you give judgment . ' ' for four years , you , o king , had been married to the queen and yet had no children , which grieved you greatly . the queen saw this , and likewise that your love was going from her , and thought night and day of some plan that might put an end to this evil . at length , when you were away fighting in distant countries , she decided what she would do , and adopted in secret the baby of a poor quarryman , sending a messenger to tell you that you had a son . no one suspected the truth except a priest to whom the queen confessed the truth , and in a few weeks she fell ill and died , leaving the baby to be brought up as became a prince . and now , if your highness will permit me , i will speak of myself . ' ' what you have already told me , ' answered the king , ' is so strange that i can not imagine what more there is to tell , but go on with your story . '
