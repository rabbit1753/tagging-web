' what would you do with a cow ? ' asked matte . ' she could not swim so far , and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here ; and even if we had her , we have nothing to feed her on . ' ' we have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass , ' rejoined maie . ' yes , of course , ' laughed matte , ' and we have also three plants of garlic . garlic would be fine feeding for her . ' ' every cow likes salt herring , ' rejoined his wife . ' even prince is fond of fish . ' ' that may be , ' said her husband . ' methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring . all very well for prince , who fights with the gulls over the last morsel . put the cow out of your head , mother , we are very well off as we are . ' the old man allowed himself to be talked over , and so they rowed out with the net . when they reached the deepest part of the water , she began to hum the words of the magic rhyme , altering the words to suit the longing of her heart : oh , ahti , with the long , long beard , who dwellest in the deep blue sea , finest treasures have i heard , and glittering fish belong to thee . the richest pearls beyond compare , are stored up in thy realm below , and ocean 's cows so sleek and fair , feed on the grass in thy green meadow . king of the waters , far and near , i ask not of thy golden store , i wish not jewels of pearl to wear , nor silver either , ask i for , but one is odd and even is two , so give me a cow , sea - king so bold , and in return i 'll give to you , a slice of the moon , and the sun 's gold . ' what 's that you 're humming ? ' asked the old man . ' oh , only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head , ' answered the old woman ; and she raised her voice and went on : oh , ahti , with the long , long beard , who dwellest in the deep blue sea , a thousand cows are in thy herd , i pray thee give one onto me . ' that 's a stupid sort of song , ' said matte . ' what else should one beg of the sea - king but fish ? but such songs are not for sunday . ' his wife pretended not to hear him , and sang and sang the same tune all the time they were on the water . matte heard nothing more as he sat and rowed the heavy boat , while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine tobacco . then they returned to the island , and soon after went to bed . but neither matte nor maie could sleep a wink ; the one thought of how he had profaned sunday , and the other of ahti 's cow .
