the chief steward thought for some time , and then , as if struck by a sudden thought , said joyfully : " i know what we must do ! there is the kurage ( jelly fish ) . he is certainly ugly to look at , but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise . let us send him to the island of monkeys to catch one . " the jelly fish was then summoned to the king 's presence , and was told by his majesty what was required of him . the jelly fish , on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be intrusted to him , looked very troubled , and said that he had never been to the island in question , and as he had never had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one . " of course , i wo n't give you my liver , but come and get it if you can ! " added the monkey mockingly from the tree . there was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity , and to return to the dragon king of the sea and to confess his failure , so he started sadly and slowly to swim back . the last thing he heard as he glided away , leaving the island behind him , was the monkey laughing at him . meanwhile the dragon king , the doctor , the chief steward , and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish . when they caught sight of him approaching the palace , they hailed him with delight . they began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to monkey island , and then they asked him where the monkey was .
