the jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this , for he believed every word the monkey said . the monkey was of no good without a liver . finally the jelly fish stopped and told the monkey so . " well , " said the monkey , " that is soon remedied . i am really sorry to think of all your trouble ; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me , i shall soon be able to get my liver . " the jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again ; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver , and bring it with him the next time . thus persuaded , the jelly fish turned his course towards the monkey island once more . no sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed , and getting up into the pine - tree where the jelly fish had first seen him , he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again , and then looking down at the jelly fish said : " so many thanks for all the trouble you have taken ! please present my compliments to the dragon king on your return !
