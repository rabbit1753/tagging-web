it happened once when a great feast was being held in the palace , that she said to the cook , ' can i go upstairs for a little bit and look on ? i will stand outside the doors . ' the cook replied , ' yes , you can go up , but in half - an - hour you must be back here to sweep up the ashes . ' then she took her little oil - lamp , and went into her little room , drew off her fur cloak , and washed off the soot from her face and hands , so that her beauty shone forth , and it was as if one sunbeam after another were coming out of a black cloud . then she opened the nut , and took out the dress as golden as the sun . and when she had done this , she went up to the feast , and everyone stepped out of her way , for nobody knew her , and they thought she must be a king 's daughter . but the king came towards her and gave her his hand , and danced with her , thinking to himself , ' my eyes have never beheld anyone so fair ! ' when the dance was ended , she curtseyed to him , and when the king looked round she had disappeared , no one knew whither . the guards who were standing before the palace were called and questioned , but no one had seen her . when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head . ' ' how did you get the ring which was in the soup ? ' he asked . ' i know nothing at all about the ring , ' she answered . so the king could find out nothing , and was obliged to send her away . after a time there was another feast , and the many - furred creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on . he answered , ' yes , but come back again in half - an - hour and cook the king the bread - soup that he likes so much . ' so she ran away to her little room , washed herself quickly , took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on . then she went upstairs looking just like a king 's daughter , and the king came towards her , delighted to see her again , and as the dance had just begun , they danced together .
