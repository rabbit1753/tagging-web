the old man allowed himself to be talked over , and so they rowed out with the net . when they reached the deepest part of the water , she began to hum the words of the magic rhyme , altering the words to suit the longing of her heart : oh , ahti , with the long , long beard , who dwellest in the deep blue sea , finest treasures have i heard , and glittering fish belong to thee . the richest pearls beyond compare , are stored up in thy realm below , and ocean 's cows so sleek and fair , feed on the grass in thy green meadow . king of the waters , far and near , i ask not of thy golden store , i wish not jewels of pearl to wear , nor silver either , ask i for , but one is odd and even is two , so give me a cow , sea - king so bold , and in return i 'll give to you , a slice of the moon , and the sun 's gold . ' what 's that you 're humming ? ' asked the old man . ' whence comes this gust of wind ? ' said maie ; and as she spoke the sea opened and swallowed up the steamer . maie sank to the bottom like a stone , but , stretching out her arms and legs , she rose to the surface , where she found the fiddler 's fiddle , and used it as a float . at the same moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of ahti , and he had only half a beard ! ' why did you throw stones at me ? ' roared the sea - king . ' oh , your majesty , it was a mistake ! put some bear 's grease on your beard and that will soon make it grow again . ' ' dame , did i not give you all you asked for -- nay , even more ? ' ' truly , truly , your majesty . many thanks for the cows . ' ' well , where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon that you promised me ? ' ' ah , your majesty , they have been scattered day and night upon the sea , except when the sky was overcast , ' slyly answered maie . ' i 'll teach you ! ' roared the sea - king ; and with that he gave the fiddle such a ' puff ' that it sent the old woman up like a sky - rocket on to her island . there prince lay , as famished as ever , gnawing the carcase of a crow . there sat matte in his ragged grey jacket , quite alone , on the steps of the old hut , mending a net .
