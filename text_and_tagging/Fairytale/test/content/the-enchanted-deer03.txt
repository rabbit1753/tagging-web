' ah , you have a gun , ' said the farmer as the young man placed it in a corner . ' that is well , for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn , and i can not catch it . it is fortune that has sent you to me . ' ' i will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you , ' replied the youth , and that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield ; then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the trigger , when , behold ! instead of a deer , a woman with long black hair was standing there . at this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in surprise , but as he looked , there was the deer eating the corn again . and thrice this happened , till the deer ran away over the moor , and the young man after her .
