' art thou satisfied now ? ' said matte to his wife . ' i should be quite satisfied , ' said his wife , ' if only i had two servants to help , and if i had some finer clothes . do n't you know that i am addressed as madam ? ' ' well , well , ' said her husband . so maie got several servants and clothes fit for a great lady . ' everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwelling for summer . you might build us a two - storey house , and fetch soil to make a garden . then you might make a little arbour up there to let us have a sea - view ; and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of an evening , and a little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather . ' ' anything more ? ' asked matte ; but he did everything that his wife wished . the rock ahtola became so grand and maie so grand that all the sea - urchins and herring were lost in wonderment . even prince was fed on beefsteaks and cream scones till at last he was as round as a butter jar . ' are you satisfied now ? ' asked matte . ' i should be quite satisfied , ' said maie , ' if only i had thirty cows . at least that number is required for such a household . ' ' go to the fairies , ' said matte .
