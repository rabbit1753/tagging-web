the queen spoke several times to her son , to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time , and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her . but he never dared to trust her with his secret ; he feared her , though he loved her , for she was of the race of the ogres , and the king would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches ; it was even whispered about the court that she had ogreish inclinations , and that , whenever she saw little children passing by , she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them . and so the prince would never tell her one word . but when the king was dead , which happened about two years afterward , and he saw himself lord and master , he openly declared his marriage ; and he went in great ceremony to conduct his queen to the palace . they made a magnificent entry into the capital city , she riding between her two children .
