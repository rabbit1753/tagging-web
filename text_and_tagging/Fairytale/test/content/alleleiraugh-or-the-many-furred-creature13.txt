when the many - furred creature came , the king asked her who she was . ' i am a poor child without father or mother . ' then he asked her , ' what do you do in my palace ? ' ' i am of no use except to have boots thrown at my head . ' ' how did you get the ring which was in the soup ? ' he asked . ' i know nothing at all about the ring , ' she answered . so the king could find out nothing , and was obliged to send her away . after a time there was another feast , and the many - furred creature begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on . he answered , ' yes , but come back again in half - an - hour and cook the king the bread - soup that he likes so much . ' so she ran away to her little room , washed herself quickly , took out of the nut the dress as silver as the moon and put it on . then she went upstairs looking just like a king 's daughter , and the king came towards her , delighted to see her again , and as the dance had just begun , they danced together . but when the dance was ended , she disappeared again so quickly that the king could not see which way she went . she ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the many - furred creature , and went into the kitchen to cook the bread - soup . when the cook was upstairs , she fetched the golden spinning - wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it . it was brought to the king , who ate it , and liked it as much as the last time . he had the cook sent to him , and again he had to confess that the many - furred creature had cooked the soup . then the many - furred creature came before the king , but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head , and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning - wheel . when the king had a feast for the third time , things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two . the cook said , ' you must be a witch , many - furred creature , for you always put something in the soup , so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the king than any that i cook . ' but because she begged hard , he let her go up for the usual time . now she put on the dress as shining as the stars , and stepped into the hall in it .
