after a time they all came to a town where a king reigned whose daughter was so serious and solemn that no one could ever manage to make her laugh . so the king had decreed that whoever should succeed in making her laugh should marry her . when dullhead heard this he marched before the princess with his goose and its appendages , and as soon as she saw these seven people continually running after each other she burst out laughing , and could not stop herself . then dullhead claimed her as his bride , but the king , who did not much fancy him as a son - in - law , made all sorts of objections , and told him he must first find a man who could drink up a whole cellarful of wine . dullhead bethought him of the little grey man , who could , he felt sure , help him ; so he went off to the forest , and on the very spot where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting with a most dismal expression of face .
