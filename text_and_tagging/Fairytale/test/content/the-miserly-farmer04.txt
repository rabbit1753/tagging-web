and with that he began to eat the pear with gusto . when he had finished , he held the pit in his hand , took his pick - ax from his shoulder ; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep . into this he thrust the pit , and covered it with earth . then he asked the folk in the market place for water , with which to water it . a pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street , and with it the bonze watered the pit . thousands of eyes were turned on the spot . and the pit could already be seen to sprout . the sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree . branches and leaves burgeoned out from it . it began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened : large , fragrant pears , which hung in thick clusters from the boughs . the bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders . in a moment all the pears had been eaten up . then the bonze took his pick - ax and cut down the tree . crash , crash ! so it went for a while , and the tree was felled . then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait .
