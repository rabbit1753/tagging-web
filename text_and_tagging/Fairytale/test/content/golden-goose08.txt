dullhead asked him what he was taking so much to heart , and the man answered : ' i do n't know how i am ever to quench this terrible thirst i am suffering from . cold water does n't suit me at all . to be sure i 've emptied a whole barrel of wine , but what is one drop on a hot stone ? ' ' i think i can help you , ' said dullhead . ' come with me , and you shall drink to your heart 's content . ' so he took him to the king 's cellar , and the man sat down before the huge casks and drank and drank till he drank up the whole contents of the cellar before the day closed .
