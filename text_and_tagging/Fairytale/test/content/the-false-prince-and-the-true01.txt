the king had just awakened from his midday sleep , for it was summer , and everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three , as they do in hot countries . he had dressed himself in cool white clothes , and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber , when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him , and one amongst them stepped forward and spoke . ' sire , this morning we were all playing tennis in the court , the prince and this gentleman with the rest , when there broke out some dispute about the game . the prince lost his temper , and said many insulting things to the other , who was playing against him , till at length the gentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face , so that the blood ran from his mouth and nose . we were all so horrified at the sight , that we should most likely have killed the man then and there , for daring to lay hands on the prince , had not his grandfather the duke stepped between and commanded us to lay the affair before you .
