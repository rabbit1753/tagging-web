once upon a time there was a big wedding at a certain farmstead , and a certain cottager was on his way to the wedding - feast . as he chanced to cross a field , he found a milk - strainer , such as are usually made of cows ' tails , and looking just like an old brown rag . he picked it up , for he thought it could be washed , and then he would give it to his wife for a dish - rag . but when he came to the house where they were celebrating the wedding , it seemed as though no one saw him . the bride and groom nodded to the rest of the guests , they spoke to them and poured for them ; but he got neither greeting nor drink . then the chief cook came and asked the other folk to sit down to the table ; but he was not asked , nor did he get anything to eat . for he did not care to sit down of his own accord when no one had asked him . at last he grew angry and thought : " i might as well go home , for not a soul pays a bit of attention to me here . " when he reached home , he said : " good evening , here i am back again . "
