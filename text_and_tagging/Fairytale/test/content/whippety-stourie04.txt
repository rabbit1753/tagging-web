and as the poor young thing , after having a good cry to herself , was drying her eyes , she chanced to look down the hill , and who should she see coming up it but an old woman , who looked like a lady born . she was dressed all in green , with a white apron , and she wore a black velvet hood on her head , and a steeple - crowned beaver hat over that , something like those , as i have heard tell , that the women wear in wales . she walked very slowly , leaning on a long staff , and she gave a bit hirple now and then , as if she were lame . as she drew near , the young widow felt it was becoming to rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman , for such she saw her to be .
