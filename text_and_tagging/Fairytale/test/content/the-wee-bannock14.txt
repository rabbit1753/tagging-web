" oh , janet , " cried the goodman in surprise , " here comes in a little bannock . it looks rare and good to eat . i 'll have one half of it . " " and i 'll have the other half , " cried the goodwife . " hit it over the back with your cloving - stick , sandy , and knock it down . quick , or it will be out at the door again . " but the bannock played " jook - about , " and dodged behind a chair . " hoot ! " cried janet contemptuously , for she thought that her husband might easily have hit it , and she threw her heckle at it . but the heckle missed it , just as her husband 's cloving - rod had done , for it played " jook - about " again , and flew out of the house .
