far up in a green valley in the island of hoy stands an immense boulder . it is hollow inside , and the natives of these northern islands call it the dwarfie stone , because long centuries ago , so the legend has it , snorro the dwarf lived there . nobody knew where snorro came from , or how long he had dwelt in the dark chamber inside the dwarfie stone . all that they knew about him was that he was a little man , with a queer , twisted , deformed body and a face of marvellous beauty , which never seemed to look any older , but was always smiling and young . men said that this was because snorro 's father had been a fairy , and not a denizen of earth , who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth , but nobody knew whether this were true or not , for the dwarf had inhabited the dwarfie stone long before the oldest man or woman in hoy had been born . one thing was certain , however : he had inherited from his mother , whom all men agreed had been mortal , the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition . and the longer he lived the more vain and ambitious did he become , until at last he always carried a mirror of polished steel round his neck , into which he constantly looked in order to see the reflection of his handsome face .
