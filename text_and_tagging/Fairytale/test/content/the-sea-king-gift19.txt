about midnight the fisherman sat up , and said to his wife : ' dost thou hear anything ? ' ' no , ' said she . ' i think the twirling of the weathercock on the roof bodes ill , ' said he ; ' we shall have a storm . ' ' oh , it is nothing but your fancy , ' said his wife . matte lay down , but soon rose again . ' the weathercock is squeaking now , ' said he . ' just fancy ! go to sleep , ' said his wife ; and the old man tried to . for the third time he jumped out of bed . ' ho ! how the weather - cock is roaring at the pitch of its voice , as if it had a fire inside it ! we are going to have a tempest , and must bring in the net . '
