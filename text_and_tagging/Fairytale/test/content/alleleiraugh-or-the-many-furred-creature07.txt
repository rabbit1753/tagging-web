she had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress , made her face and hands black , put on the fur cloak , and was once more the many - furred creature . when she came into the kitchen and was setting about her work of sweeping the ashes together , the cook said to her , ' let that wait till to - morrow , and just cook the king 's soup for me ; i want to have a little peep at the company upstairs ; but be sure that you do not let a hair fall into it , otherwise you will get nothing to eat in future ! ' so the cook went away , and the many - furred creature cooked the soup for the king . she made a bread - soup as well as she possibly could , and when it was done , she fetched her gold ring from her little room , and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up .
