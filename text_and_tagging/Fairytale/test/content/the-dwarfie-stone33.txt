" for whom hast thou purchased that ? " he asked , hoping to hear that it was intended for him . " tis a christmas gift for thy brother paul , " answered his mother , and she would have gone on to tell him how deadly a thing it was , had he given her time to speak . but her words fanned his fury into madness , for it seemed to him that this hated brother of his was claiming everything . " everything is for paul ! i am sick of his very name , " he cried . " by my troth , he shall not have this ! " and he snatched the vest from the table . it was in vain that his mother and his aunt threw themselves at his feet , begging him to lay it down , and warning him that there was not a thread in it which was not poisoned . he paid no heed to their words , but rushed from the room , and , drawing it on , ran downstairs with a reckless laugh , to show the lady morna how fine he was .
