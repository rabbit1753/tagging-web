' i positively must get a good meal before i go back to my den , ' he said to himself ; ' it is nearly a week since i have tasted anything but scraps , though perhaps no one would think it to look at my figure ! of course there are plenty of rabbits and hares in the mountains ; but indeed one needs to be a greyhound to catch them , and i am not so young as i was ! if i could only dine off that fox i saw a fortnight ago , curled up into a delicious hairy ball , i should ask nothing better ; i would have eaten her then , but unluckily her husband was lying beside her , and one knows that foxes , great and small , run like the wind . really it seems as if there was not a living creature left for me to prey upon but a wolf , and , as the proverb says : ' one wolf does not bite another . ' however , let us see what this village can produce . i am as hungry as a schoolmaster . ' now , while these thoughts were running through the mind of the wolf , the very fox he had been thinking of was galloping along the other road . at the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water , but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was . the fox 's quick ears heard the sound of his paws , though they were soft as velvet , and turning her head she said politely : ' is that you , neighbour ? what a strange place to meet in ! i hope you are quite well ? ' ' quite well as regards my health , ' answered the wolf , whose eye glistened greedily , ' at least , as well as one can be when one is very hungry . but what is the matter with you ? a fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish ! ' ' i have been ill - very ill , ' replied the fox , ' and what you say is quite true . a worm is fat in comparison with me . '
