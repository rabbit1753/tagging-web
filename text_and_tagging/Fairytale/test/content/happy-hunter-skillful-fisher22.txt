when the mikoto saw that he was discovered , he sprang down lightly from the tree and said : " i am a traveler , and as i was very thirsty i came to the well in the hopes of quenching my thirst , but i could find no bucket with which to draw the water . so i climbed into the tree , much vexed , and waited for some one to come . just at that moment , while i was thirstily and impatiently waiting , you noble ladies appeared , as if in answer to my great need . therefore i pray you of your mercy give me some water to drink , for i am a thirsty traveler in a strange land .
