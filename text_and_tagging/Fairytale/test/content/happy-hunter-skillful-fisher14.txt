nothing would appease the anger of the skillful fisher , for he had a bad disposition , and had always hated his brother because of his virtues , and now with the excuse of the lost fishing hook he planned to kill him and to usurp his place as ruler of japan . the happy hunter knew all this full well , but he could say nothing , for being the younger he owed his elder brother obedience ; so he returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook . he was much cast down , for he had lost all hope of ever finding his brother 's hook now . while he stood on the beach , lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next , an old man suddenly appeared carrying a stick in his hand . the happy hunter afterwards remembered that he did not see from whence the old man came , neither did he know how he was there - he happened to look up and saw the old man coming towards him .
