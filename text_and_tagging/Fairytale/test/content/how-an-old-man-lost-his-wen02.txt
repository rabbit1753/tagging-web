one day the firewood gave out in his kitchen , so , as his wife wanted some at once , the old man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home . it was a fine day in the early autumn , and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry to get home . so the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood , and he had collected a goodly pile to take back to his wife . when the day began to draw to a close , he turned his face homewards .
