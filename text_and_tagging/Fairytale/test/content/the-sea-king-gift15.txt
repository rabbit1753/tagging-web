' ' last night was so stormy , and we caught so little , ' urged his wife ; ' to - night the sea is like a mirror , and with the wind in this direction the herring are drawing towards land . ' ' but there are streaks in the north - western sky , and prince was eating grass this evening , ' said the old man . ' surely he has not eaten my garlic , ' exclaimed the old woman . ' no ; but there will be rough weather by to - morrow at sunset , ' rejoined matte . ' listen to me , ' said his wife , ' we will set only one net close to the shore , and then we shall be able to finish up our half - filled cask , which will spoil if it stands open so long . '
