he now began to feel extremely anxious , for he knew that his brother would be angry at his having lost his hook , for , it being his only one , he valued it above all other things . the happy hunter now set to work to look among the rocks and on the sand for the lost hook , and while he was searching to and fro , his brother , the skillful fisher , arrived on the scene . he had failed to find any game while hunting that day , and was not only in a bad temper , but looked fearfully cross . when he saw the happy hunter searching about on the shore he knew that something must have gone wrong , so he said at once : " what are you doing , my brother ? " the happy hunter went forward timidly , for he feared his brother 's anger , and said : " oh , my brother , i have indeed done badly . " " what is the matter?-what have you done ? " asked the elder brother impatiently . " i have lost your precious fishing hook- " while he was still speaking his brother stopped him , and cried out fiercely : " lost my hook ! it is just what i expected . for this reason , when you first proposed your plan of changing over our occupations i was really against it , but you seemed to wish it so much that i gave in and allowed you to do as you wished . the mistake of our trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen ! and you have done badly . i will not return you your bow and arrow till you have found my hook . look to it that you find it and return it to me quickly .
