the happy hunter took his brother 's much - prized fishing hook and rod and went down to the seashore and sat down on the rocks . he baited his hook and then threw it into the sea clumsily . he sat and gazed at the little float bobbing up and down in the water , and longed for a good fish to come and be caught . every time the buoy moved a little he pulled up his rod , but there was never a fish at the end of it , only the hook and the bait . if he had known how to fish properly , he would have been able to catch plenty of fish , but although he was the greatest hunter in the land he could not help being the most bungling fisher .
