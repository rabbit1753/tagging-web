the third sister was very kind , but had no counsel to give him , so he ate and drank and waited till her son came home , after he had sent all the birds to sleep . he thought a long while after his mother had told him the young man 's story , and at last he said that he was hungry , and the cow must be killed , as he wanted some supper . so the cow was killed and the meat cooked , and a bag made of its red skin . ' now get into the bag , ' bade the son , and the young man got in and took his gun with him , but the dog and the falcon he left outside . the keeper of the birds drew the string at the top of the bag , and left it to finish his supper , when in flew an eagle through the open door , and picked the bag up in her claws and carried it through the air to an island . there was nothing to eat on the island , and the fisher 's son thought he would die of food , when he remembered the box that the lady had put in his pocket . he opened the lid , and three tiny little birds flew out , and flapping their wings they asked , ' good master , is there anything we can do for thee ?
