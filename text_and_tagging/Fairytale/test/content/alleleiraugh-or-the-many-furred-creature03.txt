now , the king had a daughter , who was just as beautiful as her dead mother , and had just such golden hair . one day when she had grown up , her father looked at her , and saw that she was exactly like her mother , so he said to his councillors , ' i will marry my daughter to one of you , and she shall be queen , for she is exactly like her dead mother , and when i die her husband shall be king . ' but when the princess heard of her father 's decision , she was not at all pleased , and said to him , ' before i do your bidding , i must have three dresses ; one as golden as the sun , one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars . besides these , i want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin ; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it . ' but she thought to herself , ' this will be quite impossible , and i shall not have to marry someone i do not care for . ' the king , however , was not to be turned from his purpose , and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses , one as golden as the sun , and one as silver as the moon , and one as shining as the stars ; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom , and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur . at last , when all was ready , the king commanded the cloak to be brought to him , and he spread it out before the princess , and said , ' tomorrow shall be your wedding - day . ' when the princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father 's resolution , she determined to flee away . in the night , when everyone else was sleeping , she got up and took three things from her treasures , a gold ring , a little gold spinning - wheel , and a gold reel ; she put the sun , moon , and star dresses in a nut - shell , drew on the cloak of many skins , and made her face and hands black with soot . then she commended herself to god , and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest . and as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep .
