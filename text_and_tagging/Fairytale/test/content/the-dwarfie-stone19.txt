she agreed willingly . hiding her rosy face on his shoulder , she confessed that she had loved him from the very first day that she had seen him ; and ever since that moment she had determined that , if she could not we d him , she would we d no other man . for a little time they sat together , rejoicing in their new - found happiness . then earl paul sprang to his feet . " let us go and tell the good news to my mother and my brother , " he said . " harold may be disappointed at first , for i know , sweetheart , he would fain have had thee for his own . but his good heart will soon overcome all that , and he will rejoice with us also . " but the lady morna shook her head . she knew , better than her lover , what earl harold 's feeling would be ; and she would fain put off the evil hour . now , when the countess fraukirk had been away upon her wicked errand , strange things were happening at the castle at kirkwall . for harold , encouraged by his brother 's absence , offered his heart and hand once more to the lady morna . once more she refused him , and in order to make sure that the scene should not be repeated , she told him that she had plighted her troth to his brother . when he heard that this was so , rage and fury were like to devour him . mad with anger , he rushed from her presence , flung himself upon his horse , and rode away in the direction of the sea shore . while he was galloping wildly along , his eyes fell on the snow - clad hills of hoy rising up across the strip of sea that divided the one island from the other . and his thoughts flew at once to snorro the dwarf , who he had had occasion , as well as his step - aunt , to visit in bygone days . " i have it , " he cried . " stupid fool that i was not to think of it at once . i will go to snorro , and buy from him a love - potion , which will make my lady morna hate my precious brother and turn her thoughts kindly towards me .
