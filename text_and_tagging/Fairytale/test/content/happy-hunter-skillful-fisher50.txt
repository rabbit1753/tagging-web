here he found , instead of the queer basket on which he had come to the realm of ryn gu , a large crocodile waiting for him . never had he seen such a huge creature . it measured eight fathoms in length from the tip of its tail to the end of its long mouth . the sea king had ordered the monster to carry the happy hunter back to japan . like the wonderful basket which shiwozuchino okina had made , it could travel faster than any steamboat , and in this strange way , riding on the back of a crocodile , the happy hunter returned to his own land .
