" you are hohodemi , the augustness , sometimes called the happy hunter , are you not ? " asked the old man . " what are you doing alone in such a place ? " " yes , i am he , " answered the unhappy young man . " unfortunately , while fishing i lost my brother 's precious fishing hook . i have hunted this shore all over , but alas ! i can not find it , and i am very troubled , for my brother wo n't forgive me till i restore it to him . but who are you ? " " my name is shiwozuchino okina , and i live near by on this shore . i am sorry to hear what misfortune has befallen you . you must indeed be anxious . but if i tell you what i think , the hook is nowhere here - it is either at the bottom of the sea or in the body of some fish who has swallowed it , and for this reason , though you spend your whole life in looking for it here , you will never find it .
