then the old woman hid her behind a great cask , where she could not be seen . " be as still as a mouse , " said she ; " do not move or go away , or else you are lost . at night , when the robbers are asleep , we will escape . i have been waiting a long time for an opportunity . " no sooner was it settled than the wicked gang entered the house . they brought another young woman with them , dragging her along , and they were drunk , and would not listen to her cries and groans . they gave her wine to drink , three glasses full , one of white wine , one of red , and one of yellow , and then they cut her in pieces . the poor bride all the while shaking and trembling when she saw what a fate the robbers had intended for her . one of them noticed on the little finger of their victim a golden ring , and as he could not draw it off easily , he took an axe and chopped it off , but the finger jumped away , and fell behind the cask on the bride 's lap . the robber took up a light to look for it , but he could not find it .
