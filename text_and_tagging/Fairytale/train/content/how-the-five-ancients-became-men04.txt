the five ancients withdrew after they had done their work , and thereafter lived in quiet purity . the red lord dwells in the south as the god of fire . the dark lord dwells in the north , as the mighty master of the somber polar skies . he lived in a castle of liquid crystal . in later ages he sent confucius down upon earth as a saint . hence this saint is known as the son of crystal . the wood prince dwells in the east . he is honored as the green lord , and watches over the coming into being of all creatures . in him lives the power of spring and he is the god of love . the mother of metals dwells in the west , by the sea of jasper , and is also known as the queen - mother of the west . she leads the rounds of the fairies , and watches over change and growth . the yellow ancient dwells in the middle . he is always going about in the world , in order to save and to help those in any distress .
