the compass , with its needle always pointing to the north , is quite a common thing . no one thinks that it is remarkable now , though when it was first invented it must have been a wonder . now long ago in china , there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha . this was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the south . no matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the south .
