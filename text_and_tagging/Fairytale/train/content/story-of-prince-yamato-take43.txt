when the prince reached omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear . in many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations . on inquiring the cause of this he was told that a terrible monster had appeared in the mountains , who daily came down from thence and made raids on the villages , devouring whoever he could seize . many homes had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work in the fields , or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice . when yamato take heard this his wrath was kindled , and he said fiercely : " from the western end of kiushiu to the eastern corner of yezo i have subdued all the king 's enemies - there is no one who dares to break the laws or to rebel against the king . it is indeed a matter for wonder that here in this place , so near the capital , a wicked monster has dared to take up his abode and be the terror of the king 's subjects . not long shall it find pleasure in devouring innocent folk . i will start out and kill it at once .
