the lad carefully observed the command , and lay with his face covered , calmly awaiting the approach of the spirit which was to decide his good or evil fortune for all the days of his life . every morning his father came to the door of the little lodge and encouraged him to persevere , dwelling at length on the vast honor and renown that must ever attend him , should he accomplish the full term of trial allotted to him . to these glowing words of promise and glory the boy never replied , but he lay without the least sign of discontent or murmuring until the ninth day , when he addressed his father as follows : " my father , my dreams forbode evil . may i break my fast now , and at a more favorable time make a new fast ? " the father answered : " my son , you know not what you ask . if you get up now , all your glory will depart . wait patiently a little longer . you have but three days more , and your term will be completed . you know it is for your own good , and i encourage you to persevere . shall not your aged father live to see you a star among the chieftains and the beloved of battle ? " the son assented ; and covering himself more closely , that he might shut out the light which prompted him to complain , he lay till the eleventh day , when he repeated his request . the father addressed iadilla as he had the day before , and promised that he would himself prepare his first meal , and bring it to him by the dawn of the morning . the son moaned , and the father added : " will you bring shame upon your father when his sun is falling in the west ? " " i will not shame you , my father , " replied iadilla ; and he lay so still and motionless that you could only know that he was living by the gentle heaving of his breast .
