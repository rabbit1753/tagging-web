" have you seen the girl in the red coat ? " asked the stranger . and when the monk replied that he had seen nothing , the other continued : " bonze , you should not lie ! this girl is not a human being , but a flying ogre . of flying ogres there are thousands of varieties , who bring ruin to people everywhere . i have already slain a countless number of them , and have pretty well done away with them . but this one is the worst of all . last night the lord of the heavens gave me a triple command , and that is the reason i have hurried down from the skies . there are eight thousand of us under way in all directions to catch this monster . if you do not tell the truth , monk , then you are sinning against heaven itself !
