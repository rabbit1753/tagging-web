one night , when all were sleeping , it chanced that he heard a knocking at the window , and a voice which said : " come , silverwhite , i have to talk to you ! " the king , who did not want to wake his young wife , rose hastily , girded on his sword , called his dogs and went out . when he reached the open air , there stood a huge and savage - looking troll . the troll said : " silverwhite , you have slain my three brothers , and i have come to bid you go down to the sea - shore with me , that we may fight with one another . " this proposal suited the youth , and he followed the troll without protest . when they reached the sea - shore , there lay three great dogs belonging to the troll . silverwhite at once set his dogs at the troll - dogs . after a hard struggle the latter had to give in . the young king drew his sword , bravely attacked the troll and dealt him many a mighty blow . it was a tremendous battle .
