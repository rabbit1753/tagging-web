just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw moti approaching at a hard gallop , looking indeed like a giant compared with the little beast he rode , whirling his castor - oil plant , which in the distance might have been an oak tree , and the sound of his revilings and shoutings came down upon the breeze ! behind him the dust cloud moved to the sound of the thunder of hoofs , whilst here and there flashed the glitter of steel . the sight and the sound struck terror into the king , and , turning his horse , he fled at top speed , thinking that a regiment of yelling giants was upon him ; and all his force followed him as fast as they might go . one fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with that mad rush , and as moti came galloping up he flung himself on the ground in abject fear . this was too much for moti 's excited pony , who shied so suddenly that moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket , and alighted right on the top of his fat foe . quickly regaining his feet moti began to swing his plant round his head and to shout : ' where are your men ? bring them up and i 'll kill them . my regiments ! come on , the whole lot of you ! where 's your king ? bring him to me . here are all my fine fellows coming up and we 'll each pull up a tree by the roots and lay you all flat and your houses and towns and everything else ! come on !
