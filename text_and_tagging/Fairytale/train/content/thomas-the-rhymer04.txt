as he was lying there , he heard the trampling of a horse 's hooves , as it forced its way through the bushes ; and , looking up , he saw the most beautiful lady that he had ever seen coming riding towards him on a grey palfrey . she wore a hunting dress of glistening silk , the colour of the fresh spring grass ; and from her shoulders hung a velvet mantle , which matched the riding - skirt exactly . her yellow hair , like rippling gold , hung loosely round her shoulders , and on her head sparkled a diadem of precious stones , which flashed like fire in the sunlight . her saddle was of pure ivory , and her saddle - cloth of blood - red satin , while her saddle girths were of corded silk and her stirrups of cut crystal . her horse 's reins were of beaten gold , all hung with little silver bells , so that , as she rode along , she made a sound like fairy music . " i am not that blessed lady , as thou thinkest , " she said . " men call me queen , but it is of a far other country ; for i am the queen of fairy - land , and not the queen of heaven . " and certainly it seemed as if what she said were true ; for , from that moment , it was as if a spell were cast over thomas , making him forget prudence , and caution , and common - sense itself . for he knew that it was dangerous for mortals to meddle with fairies , yet he was so entranced with the lady 's beauty that he begged her to give him a kiss . this was just what she wanted , for she knew that if she once kissed him she had him in her power .
