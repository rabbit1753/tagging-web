" my business , " says tom , says he , " is to make the beautiful princess , god bless her , laugh three times . " " do you see all them merry fellows and skilful swordsmen , " says the other , " that could eat you up with a grain of salt , and not a mother 's soul of them ever got a laugh from her these seven years ? " so the fellows gathered round tom , and the bad man aggravated him till he told them he did n't care a pinch of snuff for the whole bilin ' of 'em . let 'em come on , six at a time , and try what they could do . the king , that was too far off to hear what they were saying , asked what did the stranger want . " he wants , " says the red - headed fellow , " to make hares of your best men . " " oh ! " says the king , " if that 's the way , let one of 'em turn out and try his mettle . " so one stood forward , with sword and pot - lid , and made a cut at tom . he struck the fellow 's elbow with the club , and up over their heads flew the sword , and down went the owner of it on the gravel from a thump he got on the helmet . another took his place , and another , and another , and then half a dozen at once , and tom sent swords , helmets , shields , and bodies rolling over and over , and themselves bawling out that they were kilt , and disabled , and damaged , and rubbing their poor elbows and hips , and limping away . tom contrived not to kill anyone . the princess was so amused that she let a great sweet laugh out of her that was heard all over the yard . " king of dublin , " says tom , " i 've quarter of your daughter . " and the king did n't know whether he was glad or sorry , and all the blood in the princess 's heart run into her cheeks .
