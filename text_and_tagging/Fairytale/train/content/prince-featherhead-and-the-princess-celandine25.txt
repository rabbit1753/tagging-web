one morning as she sat by a little brook , thinking sadly , she suddenly saw a young stranger approaching , and got up quickly , intending to avoid him . but prince featherhead , for it was he , perceiving her at the same moment , rushed towards her with every demonstration of joy : for he had recognised her , not as the celandine whom he had slighted , but as the lovely princess whom he had sought vainly for so long . the fact was that the fairy of the beech - woods , thinking she had been punished enough , had withdrawn the enchantment from her , and transferred it to featherhead , thereby in an instant depriving him of the good looks which had done so much towards making him the fickle creature he was . throwing himself down at the princess 's feet , he implored her to stay , and at least speak to him , and she at last consented , but only because he seemed to wish it so very much . after that he came every day in the hope of meeting her again , and often expressed his delight at being with her . but one day , when he had been begging celandine to love him , she confided to him that it was quite impossible , since her heart was already entirely occupied by another .
