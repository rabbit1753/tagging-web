after a few days had passed they had to accompany the prince of the dragon cave to the birthday festival of the king of the wu river . the festival came to an end , and all the dancers returned home . only , the king had kept back rose of evening and one of the nightingale dancers to teach the girls in his castle . months passed and no news came from rose of evening , so that aduan went about full of longing and despair . now mother hia went every day to the castle of the god of the wu river . so aduan told her that rose of evening was his cousin , and entreated her to take him along with her so that he could at least see her a single time . so she took him along , and let him stay at the lodge - house of the river - god for a few days . but the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that he could not see rose of evening even a single time . sadly aduan went back again .
