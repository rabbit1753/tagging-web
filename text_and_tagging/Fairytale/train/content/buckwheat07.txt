" close your flowers and fold your leaves , " said the old willow . " do not look at the lightning when the cloud breaks . even human beings dare not do that , for in the midst of the lightning one may look straight into god 's heaven . the sight strikes human beings blind , so dazzling is it . what would not happen to us , mere plants of the field , who are so much humbler , if we should dare do so ? " " so much humbler ! indeed ! if there is a chance , i shall look right into god 's heaven . " and in its pride and haughtiness it did so . the flashes of lightning were so awful that it seemed as if the whole world were in flames .
