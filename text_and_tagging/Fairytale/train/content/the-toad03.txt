the mother - frog had once been a traveller . she happened to be in the water - bucket when it was drawn up , but the light became too strong for her , and she got a pain in her eyes . fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket . but she fell into the water with a terrible flop , and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back . she certainly had not much to tell of the things up above , but she knew this , and all the frogs knew it , that the well was not all the world . the mother - toad might have told this and that , if she had chosen , but she never answered when they asked her anything , and so they left off asking .
