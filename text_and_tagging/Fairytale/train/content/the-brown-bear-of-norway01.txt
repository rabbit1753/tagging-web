there was once a king in ireland , and he had three daughters , and very nice princesses they were . and one day , when they and their father were walking on the lawn , the king began to joke with them , and to ask them whom they would like to be married to . ' i 'll have the king of ulster for a husband , ' says one ; ' and i 'll have the king of munster , ' says another ; ' and , ' says the youngest , ' i 'll have no husband but the brown bear of norway . ' for a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted prince that she called by that name , and she fell in love with him , and his name was the first name on her tongue , for the very night before she was dreaming of him . well , one laughed , and another laughed , and they joked with the princess all the rest of the evening .
