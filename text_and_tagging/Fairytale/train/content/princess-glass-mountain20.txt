then he took the prince by the hand , led him deep down in the earth into his cave , and there on the wall hung a suit of armor altogether forged of the clearest silver , and so bright that it shone afar . right beside it stood a snow - white steed , saddled and bridled , pawing the earth with his silver hoofs , and champing his bit till the foam dropped to the ground . the wild man said : " now get quickly into your armor , ride out and try your luck ! in the meantime i will tend your oxen . " the prince did not wait to be told a second time ; but put on his helmet and armor in all haste , securely buckled on his spurs , hung his sword at his side , and felt as light in his silver armor as a bird in the air . then he leaped into the saddle so that every clasp and buckle rang , laid his reins on the neck of his steed , and rode hastily toward the glass mountain .
