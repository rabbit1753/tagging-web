johnny town - mouse was born in a cupboard . timmy willie was born in a garden . timmy willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper . the gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier ; he packed them in a big hamper . with the utmost politeness he introduced timmy willie to nine other mice , all with long tails and white neckties . timmy willie 's own tail was insignificant . johnny town - mouse and his friends noticed it ; but they were too well bred to make personal remarks ; only one of them asked timmy willie if he had ever been in a trap ? but he did . he went back in the very next hamper of vegetables ; he said it was too quiet ! !
