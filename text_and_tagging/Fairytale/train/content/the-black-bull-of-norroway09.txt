" but the bull can not be my fortune , " she cried in terror . " i can not go away with a bull . " " but ye'll need tae , " replied the hen - wife calmly . " for you lookit out of my door with the intent of meeting your fortune ; and when your fortune has come tae ye , you must just thole it . " and when the poor princess ran weeping to her mother , to beg to be allowed to stay at home , she found her mother of the same mind as the wise woman ; and so she had to allow herself to be lifted up on to the back of the enormous black bull that had come up to the door of the castle , and was now standing there quietly enough . and when she was settled , he set off again on his wild career , while she sobbed and trembled with terror , and clung to his horns with all her might . on and on they went , until at last the poor maiden was so faint with fear and hunger that she could scarce keep her seat . just as she was losing her hold of the great beast 's horns , however , and feeling that she must fall to the ground , he turned his massive head round a little , and , speaking in a wonderfully soft and gentle voice , said : " eat out of my right ear , and drink out of my left ear , so wilt thou be refreshed for thy journey . " so the princess put a trembling hand into the bull 's right ear , and drew out some bread and meat , which , in spite of her terror , she was glad to swallow ; then she put her hand into his left ear , and found there a tiny flagon of wine , and when she had drunk that , her strength returned to her in a wonderful way . long they went , and sore they rode , till , just as it seemed to the princess that they must be getting near the world 's end , they came in sight of a magnificent castle . " that 's where we maun bide this night , " said the black bull of norroway , " for that is the house of one of my brothers . "
