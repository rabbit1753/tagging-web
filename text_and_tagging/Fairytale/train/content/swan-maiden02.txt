he waited and waited , and still he saw not so much as a thread or a hair . but about the middle of the night there came the very prettiest music that his ears had ever heard , and before he knew what he was about he was asleep and snoring until the little leaves shook upon the tree . when the morning came and he awoke , another pear was gone , and he could tell no more about it than the man in the moon . the next night the second son set out to watch the pear - tree . but he fared no better than the first . about midnight came the music , and in a little while he was snoring till the stones rattled . when the morning came another pear was gone , and he had no more to tell about it than his brother .
