there was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street , and perhaps even a little side - street besides , with silver . but he did not do that ; he knew another way of spending his money . if he spent a shilling he got back a florin - such an excellent merchant he was till he died . now his son inherited all this money . he lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five - pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones . in this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did . at last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing - gown . his friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him . but one of them who was rather good - natured sent him an old trunk with the message , " pack up ! " that was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself . it was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly . he pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away . but whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault - just think of it !
