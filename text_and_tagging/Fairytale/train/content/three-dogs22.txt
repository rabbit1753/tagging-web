while they were still talking the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold , and drew up at the foot of the mountain . when he went in he saw that uninvited guests had arrived , and was much frightened ; for well he knew of the fate that had befallen his brothers . he therefore thought it advisable to fall back upon cunning and treachery , for he had not dared to venture on open battle . for that reason he made many fine speeches , and was very friendly and smooth with the youth . then he told the king 's daughter to prepare a meal in order to show his guest all hospitality .
