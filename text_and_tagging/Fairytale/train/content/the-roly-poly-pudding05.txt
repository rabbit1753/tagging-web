" here 's one of your kittens at least , " said ribby , dragging moppet out of the flour barrel . they shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor . she seemed to be in a terrible fright . " oh ! mother , mother , " said moppet , " there 's been an old woman rat in the kitchen , and she 's stolen some of the dough ! " the two cats ran to look at the dough pan . sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers , and a lump of dough was gone ! " which way did she go , moppet ? " but moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again . ribby and tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight , while they went on with their search .
