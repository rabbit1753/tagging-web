the devil obediently thrust both hands into the split , and tore and clawed with all his might ; but suddenly murmur goose - egg knocked out the wedge , and there the devil was caught in a vice , while murmur belabored his back with the ax . the devil wailed , and begged murmur to let him go ; but murmur would hear nothing of it until he had promised never to come back and make a nuisance of himself again . besides that , he had to promise to build a bridge over the sound , on which one could go back and forth at all seasons of the year . and the bridge was to be completed immediately after the breaking up of the ice - drift . " alas ! " said the devil , but there was nothing for it but to promise if he wished to go free . yet he made one condition , that he was to have the first soul that crossed the bridge as sound - toll . he could have it , said murmur . then he let the devil out , and he ran straight home . but murmur lay down and slept until far into the following day .
