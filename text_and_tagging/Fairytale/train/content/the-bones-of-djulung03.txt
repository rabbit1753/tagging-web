then they took counsel together , and watched her to see what she did . one of them followed her to the fountain where djulung lived , and saw her give him all the rice she had saved from her breakfast . hastening home the sister told the others what she had witnessed , and that a lovely fat fish might be had for the catching . so the eldest sister went and caught him . he was boiled for supper , but the youngest sister was away in the woods , and did not know anything about it . next morning she went as usual to the cave , and sang her little song , but no djulung came to answer it . twice and thrice she sang . then she threw herself on her knees by the edge , and peered into the dark water , but the trees cast such a deep shadow that her eyes could not pierce it . ' djulung can not be dead , or his body would be floating on the surface , ' she said to herself , and rising to her feet she set out homewards , feeling all of a sudden strangely tired . ' what is the matter with me ? ' she thought , but somehow or other she managed to reach the hut , and threw herself down in a corner , where she slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her .
