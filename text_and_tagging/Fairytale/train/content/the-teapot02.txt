" i know you , " it said within itself . " i know , too , my imperfection , and i am well aware that in that very thing is seen my humility , my modesty . imperfections we all have , but we also have compensations . the cups have a handle , the sugar bowl a lid ; i have both , and one thing besides , in front , which they can never have . i have a spout , and that makes me the queen of the tea table . i spread abroad a blessing on thirsting mankind , for in me the chinese leaves are brewed in the boiling , tasteless water .
