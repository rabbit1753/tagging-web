aspenclog 's mother was an aspen - tree . he slew the man who had chopped her down . then he went to the king and asked whether he could give him work . he wanted no other pay than the right to give the king three good thumps on the back when there was no more work for him to do . the king agreed to this condition , for he thought he would always have enough work for him to do . then he sent him to the forest to gather wood . but aspenclog piled up such a tremendous load that two horses could not pull the wagon . so he took two polar bears , harnessed them to the wagon , drove it home , and left the bears in the stable , where they ate up all the king 's cattle .
