and i 've heard tell that they drew her to the palace of a great and wealthy prince , who married her ; but that is outside my story . a few weeks afterwards , the second princess thought that she would do as her sister had done , and go down to the hen - wife 's cottage , and tell her that she , too , was going out into the world to seek her fortune . and , of course , in her heart of hearts she hoped that what had happened to her sister would happen to her also . and , curious to say , it did . for the old hen - wife sent her to look out at her back door , and she went , and , lo and behold ! another coach - and - six was coming along the road . and when she went and told the old woman , she smiled upon her kindly , and told her to hurry home , for the coach - and - six was her fortune also , and that it had come for her . so she , too , ran home , and got into her grand carriage , and was driven away . and , of course , after all these lucky happenings , the youngest princess was anxious to try what her fortune might be ; so the very night , in high good humour , she tripped away down to the old witch 's cottage .
