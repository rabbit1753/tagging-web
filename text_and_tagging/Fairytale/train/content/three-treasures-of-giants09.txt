' it is hardly worth doing that , ' answered jack ; ' for i picked up the pieces and ate them myself . ' at this reply both brothers were beside themselves with anger , and fell upon the boy , beating him , and calling him names , till they were quite tired . ' go where you like , ' cried martin with a final kick ; ' but never come near us again . ' and poor jack ran weeping into the woods . the next morning his brothers went home , and bought a beautiful house , where they lived with their mother like great lords .
