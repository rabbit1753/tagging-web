the abbot of inisfalen arose upon his feet . he heard a small bird singing , and o but it sung sweet ! it sung upon a holly - bush , this little snow - white bird . a song so full of gladness he never before had heard . it sung upon a hazel . it sung upon a thorn . he had never heard such music since the hour that he was born . it sung upon a sycamore . it sung upon a briar . to follow the song and hearken this abbot could never tire . till at last he well bethought him , he might no longer stay . so he blessed the little white singing - bird , and gladly went his way .
