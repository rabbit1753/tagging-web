while traveling about her estates , madame margaret one evening came to the tavern in fjelkinge . she was quartered for the night in a room that had the name of being haunted . some years before a traveler had lain in the same room and presumably had been murdered . at any rate , the man himself and all his belongings had disappeared without leaving a trace . the mystery had never been explained . since that time the room had been haunted . those who knew about it preferred to travel a post - station further in the dark , rather than pass the night in the room in question . but margaret barnekow did not do so . she had already shown greater courage in greater contingencies , and chose this particular room to sleep in without any fear .
