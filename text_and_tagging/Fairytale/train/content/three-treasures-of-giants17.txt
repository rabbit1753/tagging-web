so at last jack 's ambition was satisfied . he could not hope to be more than king , and as long as he had his cornet to provide him with soldiers he was secure against his enemies . he never forgave his brothers for the way they had treated him , though he presented his mother with a beautiful castle , and everything she could possibly wish for . in the centre of his own palace was a treasure chamber , and in this chamber the table , the cornet , and the bag were kept as the most prized of all his possessions , and not a week passed without a visit from king john to make sure they were safe . he reigned long and well , and died a very old man , beloved by his people .
