the following evening the prince dressed himself for the tournament . before he went he said to his wife , ' now mind you do not say when you see me that i am the crab . for if you do this evil will come of it . place yourself at the window with your sisters ; i will ride by and throw you the silver apple . take it in your hand , but if they ask you who i am , say that you do not know . ' so saying , he kissed her , repeated his warning once more , and went away . the princess went with her sisters to the window and looked on at the tournament . presently her husband rode by and threw the apple up to her . she caught it in her hand and went with it to her room , and by - and - by her husband came back to her . but her father was much surprised that she did not seem to care about any of the princes ; he therefore appointed a second tournament . the crab then gave his wife the same directions as before , only this time the apple which she received from the black man was of gold . but before the prince went to the tournament he said to his wife , ' now i know you will betray me to - day . ' but she swore to him that she would not tell who he was . he then repeated his warning and went away . in the evening , while the princess , with her mother and sisters , was standing at the window , the prince suddenly galloped past on his steed and threw her the golden apple . then her mother flew into a passion , gave her a box on the ear , and cried out , ' does not even that prince please you , you fool ? ' the princess in her fright exclaimed , ' that is the crab himself ! ' her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner , ran into her daughter 's room where the crab - shell was still lying , took it up and threw it into the fire . then the poor princess cried bitterly , but it was of no use ; her husband did not come back .
