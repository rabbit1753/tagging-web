the old poet seated himself beside his hearth , and took the little fellow on his lap . he squeezed the water out of his dripping hair , warmed his hands between his own , and boiled for him some sweet wine . then the boy recovered , his cheeks again grew rosy , he jumped down from the lap where he was sitting , and danced round the kind old poet . " you are a merry fellow , " said the old man . " what 's your name ? " " my name is cupid , " answered the boy . " do n't you know me ? there lies my bow . it shoots well , i can assure you ! look , the weather is now clearing up , and the moon is shining clear again through the window . "
