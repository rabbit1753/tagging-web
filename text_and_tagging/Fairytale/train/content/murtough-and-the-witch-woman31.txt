and murtough , in his sleep and in his dreams , heard the battle - shout , and he rose impetuously from off his bed , but the wine overcame him , and his strength departed from him , and he fell helplessly upon the floor . then he heard the challenge a second time , and the stamping of the feet without , and he rose again , and madly , fiercely , he set on them , charging the hosts and scattering them before him , as he thought , as far as the fairy palace of the brugh . but all his strength was lost in fighting phantoms , for they were but stones and sods and withered leaves of the forest that he took for fighting men . now duivsech , murtough 's wife , knew what was going on . she called upon cairnech to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of his people , the men of owen and of niall , and together they went to the fort ; but sheen guarded it well , so that they could by no means find an entrance .
