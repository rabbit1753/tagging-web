tom kitten was getting very frightened ! he climbed up , and up , and up . then he waded sideways through inches of soot . he was like a little sweep himself . it was most confusing in the dark . one flue seemed to lead into another . there was less smoke , but tom kitten felt quite lost . he scrambled up and up ; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall . there were some mutton bones lying about-- " this seems funny , " said tom kitten . " who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney ? i wish i had never come ! and what a funny smell ! it is something like mouse ; only dreadfully strong . it makes me sneeze , " said tom kitten . he squeezed through the hole in the wall , and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light . he groped his way carefully for several yards ; he was at the back of the skirting - board in the attic , where there is a little mark * in the picture .
