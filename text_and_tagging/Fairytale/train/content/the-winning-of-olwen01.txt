there was once a king and queen who had a little boy , and they called his name kilweh . the queen , his mother , fell ill soon after his birth , and as she could not take care of him herself she sent him to a woman she knew up in the mountains , so that he might learn to go out in all weathers , and bear heat and cold , and grow tall and strong . kilweh was quite happy with his nurse , and ran races and climbed hills with the children who were his playfellows , and in the winter , when the snow lay on the ground , sometimes a man with a harp would stop and beg for shelter , and in return would sing them songs of strange things that had happened in the years gone by .
