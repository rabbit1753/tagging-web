" now do not be so angry , father , " said the youth . " you need not take for granted that a fellow is a vagabond because he goes about in rags . now i want you to go to the king as my proxy , and ask his daughter 's hand for me . " " come , come , why , that is utter folly and nonsense ! " cried his father . but the youth insisted that it was gospel truth , and took a birch bough , and drove his father to the king 's castle - gate . and the latter came stumbling right in to the king , and wept so that the tears just tumbled out . " well , what has happened to you , my dear fellow ? " asked the king . " if a wrong has been done you , i will see that you get your rights . " no , no wrong had been done him , said the man , but he had a son who gave him a great deal of trouble : it was impossible to make a man of him , and now he had evidently lost what few senses he did possess . " because he has just chased me to the castle - gate with a birch bough , and threatened me , if i do not get him the king 's daughter for a bride , " said the man . " set your mind at rest , my good fellow , " said the king , " and send your son to me . then we will see whether we can come to an understanding . "
