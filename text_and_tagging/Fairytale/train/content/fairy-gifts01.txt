it generally happens that people 's surroundings reflect more or less accurately their minds and dispositions . perhaps that is why the flower fairy lived in a lovely palace , with the most delightful garden you can imagine . it was full of flowers , and trees , and fountains , and fish - ponds , and everything nice . for the fairy herself was so kind and charming that everybody loved her . all the young princes and princesses who formed her court , were as happy as the day was long , simply because they were near her . they came to her when they were quite tiny , and never left her until they were grown up and had to go away into the great world . when that time came she gave to each whatever gift he asked of her . but it is chiefly of the princess sylvia that you are going to hear now . the fairy loved her with all her heart , for she was at once original and gentle . she had nearly reached the age at which the gifts were generally bestowed . however , the fairy had a great wish to know how the other princesses who had grown up and left her , were prospering . before the time came for sylvia to go herself , she resolved to send her to some of them . so one day her chariot , drawn by butterflies , was made ready , and the fairy said : ' sylvia , i am going to send you to the court of iris . she will receive you with pleasure for my sake as well as for your own . in two months you may come back to me again , and i shall expect you to tell me what you think of her . ' sylvia was very unwilling to go away , but as the fairy wished it she said nothing . only when the two months were over she stepped joyfully into the butterfly chariot . she could not get back quickly enough to the flower - fairy , who , for her part , was equally delighted to see her again .
