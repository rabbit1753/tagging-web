the prince saw his brothers walking upon the terrace , each with a lovely princess , and they came to meet him , asking if he had also found a wife . he said that he had found something much rarer - a white cat ! at which they laughed very much , and asked him if he was afraid of being eaten up by mice in the palace . and then they set out together for the town . each prince and princess rode in a splendid carriage ; the horses were decked with plumes of feathers , and glittered with gold . after them came the youngest prince , and last of all the crystal chair , at which everybody looked with admiration and curiosity . when the courtiers saw them coming they hastened to tell the king .
