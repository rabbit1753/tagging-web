there was really a change in the weather . towards morning , a thick fog covered the whole country round , and a keen wind arose , so that the cold seemed to freeze one 's bones . but when the sun rose , the sight was splendid . trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost , and looked like a forest of white coral . while on every twig glittered frozen dew - drops . the many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage , were now clearly defined , and looked like glittering lace - work . from every twig glistened a white radiance . the birch , waving in the wind , looked full of life , like trees in summer . its appearance was wondrously beautiful . and where the sun shone , how everything glittered and sparkled , as if diamond dust had been strewn about . while the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds , from which countless lights gleamed , whiter than even the snow itself .
