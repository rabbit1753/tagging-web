so the winter went on , till at last the spring sun mounted higher in the heavens and began to warm the earth . the grass grew green in the fields , and high in the air the larks were heard singing . the village girls met and danced in a ring , singing , ' beautiful spring , how came you here ? how came you here ? did you come on a plough , or was it a harrow ? ' only snowflake sat quite still by the window of the cottage . ' what is the matter , dear child ? ' asked marie . ' why are you so sad ? are you ill ? or have they treated you unkindly ? ' ' no , ' replied snowflake , ' it is nothing , mother ; no one has hurt me ; i am well . '
