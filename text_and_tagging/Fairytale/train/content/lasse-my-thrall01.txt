once upon a time there was a prince or a duke or whatever you choose to call him , but at any rate a noble tremendously high - born , who did not want to stay at home . and so he traveled about the world , and wherever he went he was well received , and hobnobbed with the very finest people ; for he had an unheard of amount of money . he at once found friends and acquaintances , no matter where he came ; for whoever has a full trough can always find pigs to thrust their snouts into it . but since he handled his money as he did , it grew less and less , and at last he was left high and dry , without a red cent . and there was an end to all his many friends ; for they did just as the pigs do . when he had been well fleeced , they began to snivel and grunt , and soon scattered , each about his own business . and there he stood , after having been led about by the nose , abandoned by all . all had been glad to help him get rid of his money ; but none were willing to help him regain it , so there was nothing left for him to do but to wander back home again like a journeyman apprentice , and beg his way as he went .
