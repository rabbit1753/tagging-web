the next day the hunter accordingly went into the woods , and his son , calling the boy from the tree , urged him to go with him to kill the squirrels . the boy objected that his father was near , but he was at length prevailed on to go , and after they had fired the tree , and while they were busy killing or taking the squirrels , the hunter suddenly made his appearance , and clasped the strange boy in his arms . he cried out , " kago , kago , do n't , do n't . you will tear my clothes ! " for he was clad in a fine apparel , which shone as if it had been made of a beautiful transparent skin . the father reassured him by every means in his power . by constant kindness and gentle words the boy was reconciled to remain with them ; but chiefly by the presence of his young friend , the hunter 's son , to whom he was fondly attached . the children were never parted from each other ; and when the hunter looked upon the strange boy , he seemed to see living in him the better spirit of his lost wife .
