now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found . the persimmon - seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone . he , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange . the crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone - like seed , and would not consent to the monkey 's proposition . " how delicious they will be to eat ! " he said to himself . at last , one day , he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one . he made several attempts to climb the tree , in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him ; but he failed each time , for a crab 's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones , both of which he can do most cleverly . in his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey , who , he knew , could climb trees better than any one else in the world . he determined to ask the monkey to help him , and set out to find him .
