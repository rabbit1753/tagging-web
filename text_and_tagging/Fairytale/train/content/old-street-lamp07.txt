on the bridge over the canal stood three persons who wished to recommend themselves to the lamp , for they thought it could give the office to whomsoever it chose . the first was a herring 's head , which could emit light in the darkness . he remarked that it would be a great saving of oil if they placed him on the lamp - post . number two was a piece of rotten wood , which also shines in the dark . he considered himself descended from an old stem , once the pride of the forest . the third was a glowworm , and how he found his way there the lamp could not imagine ; yet there he was , and could really give light as well as the others . but the rotten wood and the herring 's head declared most solemnly , by all they held sacred , that the glowworm only gave light at certain times and must not be allowed to compete with them . the old lamp assured them that not one of them could give sufficient light to fill the position of a street lamp , but they would believe nothing that it said . when they discovered that it had not the power of naming its successor , they said they were very glad to hear it , for the lamp was too old and worn out to make a proper choice .
