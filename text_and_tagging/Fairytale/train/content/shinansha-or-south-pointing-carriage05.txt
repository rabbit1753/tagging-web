the compass , with its needle always pointing to the north , is quite a common thing . no one thinks that it is remarkable now , though when it was first invented it must have been a wonder . now long ago in china , there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha . this was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the south . no matter how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the south . this curious instrument was invented by kotei , one of the three chinese emperors of the mythological age . kotei was the son of the emperor yuhi . before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man . one summer evening she went out to walk in the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star - lit heavens above her . as she looked at the north star , strange to relate , it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction . soon after this her son kotei came into the world . kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the emperor yuhi . his early reign was greatly troubled by the rebel shiyu . this rebel wanted to make himself king , and many were the battles which he fought to this end . shiyu was a wicked magician , his head was made of iron , and there was no man that could conquer him . at last kotei declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle , and the two armies met on a plain called takuroku . the emperor boldly attacked the enemy , but the magician brought down a dense fog upon the battlefield . while the royal army were wandering about in confusion , trying to find their way , shiyu retreated with his troops , laughing at having fooled the royal army .
