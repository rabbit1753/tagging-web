then kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other 's hands . for a long time kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way , each trying to bend the other 's arm , but the old man was very strong , and the strange pair were evenly matched . at last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game . " you are , indeed , a very strong child . there are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm ! " said the woodcutter . " i saw you first on the banks of the river a few hours ago , when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent . hardly able to believe what i saw i followed you home . your strength of arm , which i have just tried , proves what i saw this afternoon . when you are full - grown you will surely be the strongest man in all japan . it is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains . " then he turned to kintaro 's mother : " and you , mother , have you no thought of taking your child to the capital , and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai ( a japanese knight ) ? " " you are very kind to take so much interest in my son . " replied the mother ; " but he is as you see , wild and uneducated . i fear it would be very difficult to do as you say . because of his great strength as an infant i hid him away in this unknown part of the country , for he hurt every one that came near him . i have often wished that i could , one day , see my boy a knight wearing two swords . but as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the capital , i fear my hope will never come true .
