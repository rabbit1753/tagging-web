the debtor proved to be an old miser , who lived at the other end of the village . he had hoped for many months that the paper he had written had been lost or destroyed , and , indeed , when he saw it , was very unwilling to pay what he owed . however , the stranger threatened to drag him before the king , and when the miser saw that there was no help for it he counted out the coins one by one . the stranger picked them up and put them in his pocket , and went back to his inn feeling that he was now a rich man . a few weeks after this he was walking through the streets of the nearest town , when he met a poor woman crying bitterly . he stopped and asked her what was the matter , and she answered between her sobs that her husband was dying , and , to make matters worse , a creditor whom he could not pay was anxious to have him taken to prison .
