there was once a little boy whose name was lars , and because he was so little he was called little lasse ; he was a brave little man , for he sailed round the world in a pea - shell boat . it was summer time , when the pea shells grew long and green in the garden . little lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose high above his cap , and he picked seventeen large shells , the longest and straightest he could find . little lasse thought , perhaps , that no one saw him ; but that was foolish , for god sees everywhere . then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder , and he heard something rustling in the pea bed . ' i think that must be a sparrow , ' he said . ' ras ! ras ! ' but no sparrows flew out , for little lasse had no wings , only two small legs . ' wait ! i will load my gun and shoot the sparrows , ' said the gardener . then little lasse was frightened , and crept out on to the path . ' forgive me , dear gardener ! ' he said . ' i wanted to get some fine boats . ' ' well , i will this time , ' said the gardener . ' but another time little lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed . '
