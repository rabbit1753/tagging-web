" let the devil fetch the water , i 'm far too handsome to bother with it ! " said she , and threw away the water - pail . and then she suddenly noticed that the face in the water was that of the princess who sat in the tree . this made her so angry that she pulled her down from the tree , and threw her into the pond . then she herself put on mike by the stove 's smock , and climbed into the tree . when the king arrived , and saw the swart , homely kitchen - maid , he grew red and white in turn ; but when he heard the people say she was the greatest beauty in twelve kingdoms , he had to believe , willy - nilly , that there was something in it , and he did not want to be unjust to mike by the stove , who had taken so much trouble to find her . she might grow more beautiful in time , thought he , if she were adorned with jewels , and dressed in fine clothes , and so he took her home with him . then they sent for wig - makers and seamstresses , and she was adorned and dressed like a princess ; but for all their washing and bedizening , she remained swart and homely .
