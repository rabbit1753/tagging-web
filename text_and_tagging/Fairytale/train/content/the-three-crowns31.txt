so he changed his clothes , and washed himself , and out he set to the prince 's forge and asked him to sit along with himself . the prince begged to be allowed to sit in the other carriage , and when they were half - way he opened his snuff - box . ' master , ' says he , ' i 'd wish to be dressed now according to my rank . ' ' you shall be that , ' says seven inches . ' and now i 'll bid you farewell . continue as good and kind as you always were ; love your wife ; and that 's all the advice i 'll give you . ' so seven inches vanished ; and when the carriage door was opened in the yard , out walks the prince as fine as hands could make him , and the first thing he did was to run over to his bride and embrace her . every one was full of joy but the two other princes . there was not much delay about the marriages , and they were all celebrated on the one day . soon after , the two elder couples went to their own courts , but the youngest pair stayed with the old king , and they were as happy as the happiest married couple you ever heard of in a story .
