but little recked the horse - dealer of arthur and his knights , nor yet of thomas the rhymer . he was riding along at a snail 's pace , thinking over the bargains which he had made at the fair that day . he was wondering when he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses . all at once he was startled by the approach of a venerable man , with white hair and an old - world dress , who seemed almost to start out of the ground , so suddenly did he make his appearance . when they met , the stranger stopped . to canonbie dick 's great amazement , asked him for how much he would be willing to part with his horses .
