" will you wait ! halt ! catch it ! hold it ! " they all cried together , and wanted to catch up with it and grab it on the run ; but the pancake rolled and rolled , and sure enough , it got so far ahead of them that they could no longer see it , for it had nimbler legs than all of them . after it had rolled a while it met a man . " good - day , pancake , " said the man . " good - day , man tan , " said the pancake . " dear , good pancake , do n't roll so fast ; but wait a little and let me eat you ! " said the man . " mother gray and grandpa i 've left behind , and the seven squallers , too , you 'll find , so i think i can leave you as well , man tan ! " said the pancake , and rolled and rolled until it met a hen .
