' replied marie , who happened to be in a very good temper ; ' it might amuse us a little . but there is no use making a woman . let us make a little snow child , and pretend it is a living one . ' ' yes , let us do that , ' said ivan , and he took down his cap and went into the garden with his old wife . then the two set to work with all their might to make a doll out of the snow . they shaped a little body and two little hands and two little feet . on top of all they placed a ball of snow , out of which the head was to be . ' what in the world are you doing ? ' asked a passer - by . ' ca n't you guess ? ' returned ivan . ' making a snow - child , ' replied marie .
