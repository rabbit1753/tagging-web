at last tom came to one of the city gates , and the guards laughed and cursed at him instead of letting him through . tom stood it all for a little time , but at last one of them -- out of fun , as he said -- drove his bagnet half an inch or so into his side . tom did nothing but take the fellow by the scruff of his neck and the waistband of his corduroys and fling him into the canal . some ran to pull the fellow out , and others to let manners into the vulgarian with their swords and daggers . but a tap from his club sent them headlong into the moat or down on the stones , and they were soon begging him to stay his hands . so at last one of them was glad enough to show tom the way to the palace yard . there was the king and the queen , and the princess in a gallery , looking at all sorts of wrestling and sword - playing , and rinka - fadhas ( long dances ) and mumming , all to please the princess . but not a smile came over her handsome face . well , they all stopped when they seen the young giant , with his boy 's face and long black hair , and his short curly beard -- for his poor mother could n't afford to buy razhurs -- and his great strong arms and bare legs , and no covering but the goat - skin that reached from his waist to his knees . but an envious wizened basthard of a fellow , with a red head , that wished to be married to the princess , and did n't like how she opened her eyes at tom , came forward , and asked his business very snappishly .
