" when he heard that he went over to the bull , took hold of the horn , twisted it , and it came away with him in his hand . he laid it on the ground , put in his hand , and drew out food and drink and a table - cloth . he spread the table - cloth on the ground , set the food and drink on it , and then he ate and drank his enough . when he had his enough eaten and drunk , he put the table - cloth back again , and left the horn back in the place where it was before .
