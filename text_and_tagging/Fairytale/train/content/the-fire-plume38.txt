the spring , with all its blossoms and its delicate newness of life , came among them ; the indians assembled to celebrate their vernal feast from all the country round . among them came the sad cousin of wassamo . he was pale and thin as the shadow of the shaft that flies . the pain of his mind had changed his features , and wherever he turned his eyes , they were dazzled with the sight of the red blood of his friend . the parents of wassamo , far gone in despair , and weary with watching for his return , now demanded the life of netawis . the village was stirred to its very heart by their loud lamentings ; and , after a struggle of pity , they decided to give the young man 's life to the parents . they said that they had waited long enough . a day was appointed on which the cousin was to yield his life for his friend 's . he was a brave youth , and they bound him only by his word to be ready at the appointed hour . he said that he was not afraid to die ; for he was innocent of the great wrong they laid to his charge .
