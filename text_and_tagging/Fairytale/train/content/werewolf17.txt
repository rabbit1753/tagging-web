the moment she did so a hollow roar , like that of some wild beast , sounded from the forest . it came nearer , and turned into such a terrible howling that all the surrounding hills reechoed it . finally there was a cracking and breaking among the trees , the bushes were thrust aside , and the princess saw a great grey wolf come running out of the forest and straight up the hill . she was much frightened and would gladly have run away , had she been able . but the old man said : " make haste , run to the edge of the hill and the moment the wolf comes along , upset the kettle on him ! " the princess was terrified , and hardly knew what she was about . yet she did as the old man said , took the kettle , ran to the edge of the hill , and poured its contents over the wolf just as he was about to run up . and then a strange thing happened : no sooner had she done so , than the wolf was transformed , cast off his thick grey pelt , and in place of the horrible wild beast , there stood a handsome young man , looking up to the hill . and when the king 's daughter collected herself and looked at him , she saw that it was really and truly her lover , who had been turned into a werewolf .
