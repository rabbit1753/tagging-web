" and that is the truth , " the woman replied , " for he grants my every wish before it is spoken . " " but take my word for it , " said kitta , " there is still a bit of deceit in him . he has a pair of long hairs under his chin . if you could get at them with a razor , and cut them off while he is asleep , then he would be altogether without malice . " " well , " said the woman , " if that will help , i will be sure to keep an eye open after dinner and attend to it , for then he always takes a little noon - day nap . " then kitta grau went out into the forest to the husband and bade him good - day . " you really have a very good wife , " said kitta . " she could not be better , " replied the husband . " well you might be mistaken for all that , " said kitta . " when you come home , be on your guard . when you go to take your noon - day nap , she has in mind to cut your throat . so be sure not to go to sleep . "
