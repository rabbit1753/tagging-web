' ah , it was not all for buying or selling that your handsome son has been coming to town every week these many months past . and not by the shortest way , either ! no , it was over the river he rode , and across the hill and past the cottage of miguel the vine - keeper , whose daughter , they say , is the prettiest girl in the whole country side , though she is too white for my taste , ' and then the landlady paused again , and glanced up at the farmer , to see how he was taking it . she did not learn much . he was looking straight before him , his teeth set . but as she ceased to talk , he said quietly , ' go on . ' ' there is not much more to tell , ' replied the landlady , for she suddenly remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always stopped at the inn on market days , before starting for home , ' but one fine morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill , and were married . my cousin is servant to the priest , and she found out about it and told me . but good - day to you , sir ; here is your horse , and i must hurry off to the kitchen .
