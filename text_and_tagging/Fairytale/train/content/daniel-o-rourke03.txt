i wandered and wandered about there , without knowing where i wandered , until at last i got into a big bog . the moon was shining as bright as day , or your fair lady 's eyes , sir ( with your pardon for mentioning her ) , and i looked east and west , north and south , and every way , and nothing did i see but bog , bog , bog . i could never find out how i got into it ; and my heart grew cold with fear , for sure and certain i was that it would be my berrin ' place . so i sat upon a stone , which , as good luck would have it , was close by me , and i began to scratch my head , and sing the ullagone -- when all of a sudden the moon grew black , and i looked up and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it , and i could not tell what it was . down it came with a pounce , and looked at me full in the face ; and what was it but an eagle?--as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of kerry !
