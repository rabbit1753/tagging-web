just as i was falling asleep last night , i heard a horse 's tramp on the grass and a knock at the door , and there , when i came out , was a fine - looking dark man , mounted on a black horse , and he told me to get ready in all haste , for a lady was in great want of me . as soon as i put on my cloak and things , he took me by the hand , and i was sitting behind him before i felt myself stirring . " where are we going , sir ? " says i. " you 'll soon know , " says he ; and he drew his fingers across my eyes , and not a ray could i see . i kept a tight grip of him , and i little knew whether he was going backwards or forwards , or how long we were about it , till my hand was taken again , and i felt the ground under me . the fingers went the other way across my eyes , and there we were before a castle door , and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all painted in fine green colours , with red and gold bands and ornaments , and the finest carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains , and grand ladies and gentlemen walking about . at last we came to a bedroom , with a beautiful lady in bed , with a fine bouncing boy beside her . the lady clapped her hands , and in came the dark man and kissed her and the baby , and praised me , and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the child all over .
