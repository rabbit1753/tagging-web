jorinde wept from time to time , and she sat herself down in the sunshine and lamented , and joringel lamented too . they felt as sad as if they had been condemned to die ; they looked round and got quite confused , and did not remember which was their way home . half the sun was still above the mountain and half was behind it when joringel looked through the trees and saw the old wall of the castle quite near them . he was terrified and half dead with fright . jorinde sang : ' my little bird with throat so red sings sorrow , sorrow , sorrow ; he sings to the little dove that 's dead , sings sorrow , sor -- jug , jug , jug . '
