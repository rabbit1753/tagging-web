she entered , and asked him if he could tell her of any path that would lead her over the mountain . the old man laid down his hammer and looked at her , slowly shaking his head as he did so . " na , na , lassie , " he said , " there is no easy road over the mountain of glass . folk maun either walk round it , which is not an easy thing to do , for the foot of it stretches out for hundreds of miles , and the folk who try to do so are almost sure to lose their way ; or they maun walk over the top of it , and that can only be done by those who are shod with iron shoon . " " and how am i to get these iron shoon ? " cried the princess eagerly . " couldst thou fashion me a pair , good man ? i would gladly pay thee for them . " then she stopped suddenly , for she remembered that she had no money . " these shoon can not be made for siller , " said the old man solemnly . " they can only be earned by service . i alone can make them , and i make them for those who are willing to serve me . "
