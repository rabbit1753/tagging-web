he plucked this flower and went with it to the castle ; and there everything which he touched with the flower was freed from the enchantment , and he got his jorinde back again through it . when he awoke in the morning he began to seek mountain and valley to find such a flower . he sought it for eight days , and on the ninth early in the morning he found the blood - red flower . in its centre was a large dew - drop , as big as the most lovely pearl . he travelled day and night with this flower till he arrived at the castle . when he came within a hundred paces of it he did not cease to be able to move , but he went on till he reached the gate .
