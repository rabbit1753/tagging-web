' yes , ' he answered , ' they are pursuing us , and are quite close . ' ' then no time must be lost , ' said hyacinthia , and she immediately turned herself into a river , prince milan into an iron bridge , and the charger into a blackbird . behind the bridge the road branched off into three ways . the magician 's servants hurried after the fresh tracks , but when they came to the bridge , they stood , not knowing which road to take , as the footprints stopped suddenly , and there were three paths for them to choose from . in fear and trembling they returned to tell the magician what had happened . he flew into a dreadful rage when he saw them , and screamed out , ' oh , you fools ! the river and bridge were they ! go back and bring them to me at once , or it will be the worse for you .
