there was a princess who was as pretty as a picture , and she was so proud of that that she would not so much as look at a body ; all the same , there was no lack of lads who came a - wooing , and who would have liked nothing so much as to have had her for a sweetheart because she was so good - looking . but , no , she would have nothing to do with any of them ; this one was too young and that one was too old ; this one was too lean and that one was too fat ; this one was too little and that one was too big ; this one was too dark and that one was too fair . so there was never a white sheep in the whole flock , as one might say . now there was one came who was a king in his own country , and a fine one at that . the only blemish about him was a mole on his chin ; apart from that he was as fresh as milk and rose leaves . but when the princess saw him she burst out laughing ; " who would choose a specked apple from the basket ? " said she ; and that was all the cake the prince bought at that shop , for off he was packed .
