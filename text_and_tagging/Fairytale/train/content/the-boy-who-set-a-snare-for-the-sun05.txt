when he got up he was very pale , but very resolute too . he bade his sister make a snare , for , he informed her , that he meant to catch the sun . she said she had nothing . but after awhile she brought forward a deer 's sinew which the father had left , and which she soon made into a string suitable for a noose . the moment she showed it to him he was quite angry , and told her that would not do , and directed her to find something else . she said she had nothing - nothing at all . at last she thought of the bird - skin that was left over when the coat was made ; and this she wrought into a string . with this the little boy was more vexed than before . " the sun has had enough of my bird - skins , " he said ; " find something else . " she went out of the lodge saying to herself , " was there ever so obstinate a boy ? " she did not dare to answer this time that she had nothing . luckily she thought of her own beautiful hair , and pulling some of it from among her locks , she quickly braided it into a cord . upon returning , she handed it to her brother .
