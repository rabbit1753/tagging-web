" so the old fairy led her into the castle , and , though it was still the middle of the night , the queen could see plainly that it was far more beautiful than she had been told , which you can easily believe , prince , " said the white cat , " when i tell you that it was this castle that we are now in . ' will you gather the fruit yourself , queen ? ' said the old fairy , ' or shall i call it to come to you ? ' ' i beg you to let me see it come when it is called , ' cried the queen ; ' that will be something quite new . ' the old fairy whistled twice , then she cried : ' apricots , peaches , nectarines , cherries , plums , pears , melons , grapes , apples , oranges , lemons , gooseberries , strawberries , raspberries , come ! ' and in an instant they came tumbling in one over another , and yet they were neither dusty nor spoilt , and the queen found them quite as good as she had fancied them . you see they grew upon fairy trees .
