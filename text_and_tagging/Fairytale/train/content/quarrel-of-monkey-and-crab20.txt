while all this was taking place the monkey was congratulating himself ( as the wicked often do before their punishment comes upon them ) on all he had done so neatly . he thought it quite a fine thing that he had robbed his friend of all his ripe persimmons and then that he had killed him . still , smile as hard as he might , he could not banish altogether the fear of the consequences should his evil deeds be discovered . if he were found out ( and he told himself that this could not be for he had escaped unseen ) the crab 's family would be sure to bear him hatred and seek to take revenge on him . so he would not go out , and kept himself at home for several days . he found this kind of life , however , extremely dull , accustomed as he was to the free life of the woods , and at last he said : " no one knows that it was i who killed the crab ! i am sure that the old thing breathed his last before i left him . dead crabs have no mouths ! who is there to tell that i am the murderer ? since no one knows , what is the use of shutting myself up and brooding over the matter ? what is done can not be undone !
