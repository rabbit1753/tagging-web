so they took him to be christened , and the parson said : ' you 'll never be able to put that child in a decent bed on account of his prickles . ' which was true , but they shook down some straw for him behind the stove , and there he lay for eight years . his father grew very tired of him and often wished him dead , but he did not die , but lay on there year after year . now one day there was a big fair at the market town to which the farmer meant to go , so he asked his wife what he should bring her from it . ' some meat and a couple of big loaves for the house , ' said she . then he asked the maid what she wanted , and she said a pair of slippers and some stockings . lastly he said , ' well , jack my hedgehog , and what shall i bring you ? ' ' daddy , ' said he , ' do bring me a bagpipe . ' when the farmer came home he gave his wife and the maid the things they had asked for , and then he went behind the stove and gave jack my hedgehog the bagpipes .
