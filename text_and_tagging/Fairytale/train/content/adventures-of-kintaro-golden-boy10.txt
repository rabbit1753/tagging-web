now the monkey got up looking very cross , and as they say in japan " his stomach stood up , " for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten . so he said to kintaro and the others who were standing by : " i have not been fairly beaten . my foot slipped and i tumbled . please give me another chance and let the hare wrestle with me for another round . " then kintaro consenting , the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again . now , as every one knows , the monkey is a cunning animal by nature , and he made up his mind to get the best of the hare this time if it were possible . to do this , he thought that the best and surest way would be to get hold of the hare 's long ear . this he soon managed to do . the hare was quite thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard . the monkey seizing his opportunity at last , caught hold of one of the hare 's legs and sent him sprawling in the middle of the dais . the monkey was now the victor and received , a rice - dumpling from kintaro , which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back .
