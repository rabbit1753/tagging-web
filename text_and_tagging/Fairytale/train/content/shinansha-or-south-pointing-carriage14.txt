this wise and good emperor did not rest till he had secured peace and prosperity throughout his whole land . he was beloved by his subjects , who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for many long years under him . he spent a great deal of time in making inventions which would benefit his people , and he succeeded in many besides the boat and the south pointing shinansha . he had reigned about a hundred years when one day , as kotei was looking upwards , the sky became suddenly red , and something came glittering like gold towards the earth . as it came nearer kotei saw that it was a great dragon . the dragon approached and bowed down its head before the emperor . the empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming .
