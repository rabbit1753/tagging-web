in the place to which they came all was adorned with silver plates and dishes , and with ornaments of silver , and ola thought that the king himself had nothing finer . they offered him a drink , which he drank ; but he would not eat , for the food did not seem to him to be appetizing . suddenly the man with the gilded goat 's horns came in , and gave ola a shove before he knew it ; but ola came back at him as before , and so they beat and pulled each other through all the rooms , and along all the walls . ola was of the opinion that they had been at it all night long ; but by that time the scuffle had lasted over fourteen days , and they had already tolled the church bells for him on three successive thursday evenings . on the third thursday evening he was in ill ease , for the people in the hill had in mind to thrust him forth . when the bells stopped ringing , he sat at a crack in the hill , with his head looking out . had not a man come by and happened to spy him , and told the people to keep on ringing the church - bells , the hill would have closed over him again , and he would probably still be inside . but when he came out he had been so badly beaten , and was so miserable , that it passed all measure . the lumps on his head were each bigger than the other , his whole body was black and blue , and he was quite out of his mind . and from time to time he would leap up , run off and try to get back into the hill to take up his quarrel again , and fight for the gilded goat 's horns . for those he wanted to break from the giant 's forehead .
