this curious instrument was invented by kotei , one of the three chinese emperors of the mythological age . kotei was the son of the emperor yuhi . before he was born his mother had a vision which foretold that her son would be a great man . one summer evening she went out to walk in the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star - lit heavens above her . as she looked at the north star , strange to relate , it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction . soon after this her son kotei came into the world .
