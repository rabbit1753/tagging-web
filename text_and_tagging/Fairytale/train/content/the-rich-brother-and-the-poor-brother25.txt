now all that night it had rained heavily , and did not seem likely to stop , and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was almost impossible to get across it . in one spot it was so very bad that a mule laden with baggage had got stuck in it , and tug as he might , his master was quite unable to pull him out . the muleteer in despair appealed to the two horseman , who were carefully skirting the swamp at some distance off , but they paid no heed to his cries , and he began to talk cheerfully to his mule , hoping to keep up his spirits , declaring that if the poor beast would only have a little patience help was sure to come .
