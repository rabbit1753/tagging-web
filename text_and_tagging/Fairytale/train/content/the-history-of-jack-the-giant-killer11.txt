he traveled over high hills , and on the third day he came to a large and spacious forest through which his road lay . scarcely had he entered the forest when he beheld a monstrous giant dragging along by the hair of their heads a handsome knight and his lady . jack alighted from his horse , and tying him to an oak tree , put on his invisible coat , under which he carried his sword of sharpness . when he came up to the giant he made several strokes at him , but could not reach his body , but wounded his thighs in several places ; and at length , putting both hands to his sword and aiming with all his might , he cut off both his legs . then jack , setting his foot upon his neck , plunged his sword into the giant 's body , when the monster gave a groan and expired .
