a mother sat there with her little child . she was so downcast , so afraid that it should die ! it was so pale , the small eyes had closed themselves , and it drew its breath so softly , now and then , with a deep respiration , as if it sighed . the mother looked still more sorrowfully on the little creature . then a knocking was heard at the door , and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse - cloth , for it warms one . he needed it , as it was the cold winter season ! everything out - of - doors was covered with ice and snow , and the wind blew so that it cut the face . as the old man trembled with cold , and the little child slept a moment , the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it on the stove , that it might be warm for him . the old man sat and rocked the cradle , and the mother sat down on a chair close by him , and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep , and raised its little hand .
