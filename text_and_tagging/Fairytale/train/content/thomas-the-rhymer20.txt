poor thomas , meanwhile , stood far away at the other end of the hall , feeling very lonely , yet fascinated by the extraordinary scene on which he was gazing . for , although all the fine ladies , and courtiers , and knights were dancing in one part of the hall , there were huntsmen coming and going in another part , carrying in great antlered deer , which apparently they had killed in the chase , and throwing them down in heaps on the floor . and there were rows of cooks standing beside the dead animals , cutting them up into joints , and bearing away the joints to be cooked . altogether it was such a strange , fantastic scene that thomas took no heed of how the time flew , but stood and gazed , and gazed , never speaking a word to anybody . this went on for three long days , then the queen rose from her throne , and , stepping from the dais , crossed the hall to where he was standing .
