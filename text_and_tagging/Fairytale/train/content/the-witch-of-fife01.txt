in the kingdom of fife , in the days of long ago , there lived an old man and his wife . the old man was a douce , quiet body , but the old woman was lightsome and flighty , and some of the neighbours were wo nt to look at her askance , and whisper to each other that they sorely feared that she was a witch . and her husband was afraid of it , too , for she had a curious habit of disappearing in the gloaming and staying out all night ; and when she returned in the morning she looked quite white and tired , as if she had been travelling far , or working hard .
