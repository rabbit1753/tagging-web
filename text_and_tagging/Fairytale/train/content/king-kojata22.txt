' the town is easy to get into , but more difficult to get out of , ' sighed hyacinthia . ' but let it be as you wish . go , and i will await you here , but i will first change myself into a white milestone ; only i pray you be very careful . the king and queen of the town will come out to meet you , leading a little child with them . whatever you do , do n't kiss the child , or you will forget me and all that has happened to us . i will wait for you here for three days . ' the prince hurried to the town , but hyacinthia remained behind disguised as a white milestone on the road . the first day passed , and then the second , and at last the third also , but prince milan did not return , for he had not taken hyacinthia 's advice . the king and queen came out to meet him as she had said , leading with them a lovely fair - haired little girl , whose eyes shone like two clear stars . the child at once caressed the prince , who , carried away by its beauty , bent down and kissed it on the cheek . from that moment his memory became a blank , and he forgot all about the beautiful hyacinthia .
