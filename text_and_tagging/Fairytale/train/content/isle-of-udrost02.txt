one day isaac had put out a few miles to sea to fish , when suddenly a dark fog fell . in a flash such a tremendous storm broke , that he had to throw all his fish overboard in order to lighten ship and save his life . even then it was very hard to keep the boat afloat . he steered a careful course between and across the mountainous waves , which seemed ready to swallow him from moment to moment . after he had kept on for five or six hours in this manner , he thought that he ought to touch land somewhere . but time went by , and the storm and fog grew worse and worse . then he began to realize that either he was steering out to sea , or that the wind had veered , and at last he made sure the latter was the case . he sailed on and on without a sight of land .
