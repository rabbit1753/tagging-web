after this great wrong the princes drove to the royal castle , and one may well imagine how happy the king was to get back his three daughters . in the meantime the poor youth lay like dead off in a gorge in the forest . yet he was not quite dead , and his faithful dogs lay about him , kept him warm , and licked his wounds . and they did not stop until their master came back to life again . when he was once more well and strong he set out , and after many difficulties came to the royal castle in which the princesses dwelt . when he came in the whole court was full of joy and merriment , and from the king 's hall came the sound of dancing and string music . that surprised him greatly , and he asked what it all meant . the serving - man answered : " you must come from far away , since you do not know that the king has regained his daughters who were in the power of the mountain troll . this is the oldest princess 's wedding - day .
