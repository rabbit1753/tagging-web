when he had finished pacing round the ring he stepped boldly on to the enchanted ground , and walked across it ; and what was his astonishment to find that all the ghostly elves and goblins whom he had seen , were lying frozen into tiny blocks of ice , so that he was sore put to it to walk amongst them without treading upon them . and as he approached the marble table the very hairs rose on his head at the sight of the elfin king sitting behind it , stiff and stark like his followers ; while in front of him lay the form of earl gregory , who had shared the same fate . nothing stirred , save two coal - black ravens , who sat , one on each side of the table , as if to guard the emerald goblet , flapping their wings , and croaking hoarsely . when earl st . clair lifted the precious cup , they rose in the air and circled round his head , screaming with rage , and threatening to dash it from his hands with their claws ; while the frozen elves , and even their mighty king himself stirred in their sleep , and half sat up , as if to lay hands on this presumptuous intruder . but the power of the holy sign restrained them , else had earl st . clair been foiled in his quest .
