as the first tiny little tongue of flame crept up , the poor old man thought that his last hour had come . but when he thought that , he forgot completely that his wife was a witch . for , just as the little tongue of flame began to singe his breeches , there was a swish and a flutter in the air , and a great grey bird , with outstretched wings , appeared in the sky , and swooped down suddenly , and perched for a moment on the old man 's shoulder . and in this grey bird 's mouth was a little red pirnie , which , to everyone 's amazement , it popped on to the prisoner 's head . then it gave one fierce croak , and flew away again , but to the old man 's ears that croak was the sweetest music that he had ever heard .
