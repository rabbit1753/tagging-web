one day the prince went out hunting , and going in pursuit of a wild boar he soon lost the other huntsmen , and found himself quite alone in the middle of a dark wood . the trees grew so thick and near together that it was almost impossible to see through them , only straight in front of him lay a little patch of meadowland . overgrown with thistles and rank weeds , in the centre of which a leafy lime tree reared itself . suddenly a rustling sound was heard in the hollow of the tree , and an extraordinary old man with green eyes and chin crept out of it . ' a fine day , prince milan , ' he said ; ' you 've kept me waiting a good number of years ; it was high time for you to come and pay me a visit . ' ' who are you , in the name of wonder ? ' demanded the astonished prince . ' you 'll find out soon enough , but in the meantime do as i bid you . greet your father king kojata from me , and do n't forget to remind him of his debt ; the time has long passed since it was due , but now he will have to pay it . farewell for the present ; we shall meet again . ' with these words the old man disappeared into the tree , and the prince returned home rather startled , and told his father all that he had seen and heard . the king grew as white as a sheet when he heard the prince 's story , and said , ' woe is me , my son ! the time has come when we must part , ' and with a heavy heart he told the prince what had happened at the time of his birth .
