the sister now began to believe that her brother was an extraordinary boy . yet she was not altogether satisfied in her mind that he was greater than the rest of the world . they sat , one evening , in the lodge , musing with each other in the dark , by the light of each other 's eyes -- for they had no other of any kind -- when the sister said , " my brother , it is strange that you , who can do so much , are no wiser than the ko - ko , who gets all his light from the moon ; which shines or not , as it pleases . " " and is not that light enough ? " asked the little spirit . " quite enough , " the sister replied . " if it would but come within the lodge and not sojourn out in the tree - tops and among the clouds . " " we will have a light of our own , sister , " said the boy - man . casting himself upon a mat by the door , he commenced singing : fire - fly , fire - fly , bright little thing , light me to bed and my song i will sing . give me your light , as you fly o'er my head , that i may merrily go to my bed . give me your light o'er the grass as you creep , that i may joyfully go to my sleep . come , little fire - fly , come little beast , come ! and i 'll make you to - morrow a feast . come , little candle , that flies as i sing , bright little fairy - bug , night 's little king . come and i 'll dream as you guide me along . come and i 'll pay you , my bug , with a song . as the boy - man chanted this call , they came in at first one by one , then in couples , till at last , swarming in little armies , the fire - flies lit up the little lodge with a thousand sparkling lamps , just as the stars were lighting the mighty hollow of the sky without . the faces of the sister and brother shone upon each other , from their opposite sides of the lodge , with a kindly gleam of mutual trustfulness . never more from that hour did a doubt of each other darken their little household .
