the old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time while she rested . he took the pestle , but instead of doing the work as he was told , the badger at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood . he then killed her and cut her up and made soup of her , and waited for the return of the old farmer . the old man worked hard in his fields all day , and as he worked he thought with pleasure that no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger .
