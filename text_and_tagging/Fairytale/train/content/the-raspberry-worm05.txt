now it was just dinner time , so they all had a dinner of raspberries and cream . ' be careful with the sugar , otto , ' said the big sister ; but otto 's plate was like a snowdrift in winter , with just a little red under the snow . soon after dinner the big sister said : ' now we have eaten up the raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter ; it would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries , then we could clean them this evening , and to - morrow we could cook them in the big preserving pan , and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our bread !
