the next morning , before dawn , the giant went to the forest again . " well , now i must get under way , " said the prince , " and it is a way i wish i could find . " so he said farewell to the princess for the time being , and when he stepped out of the door , the wolf was standing there waiting for him . he told him what had happened at the giant 's , and said that now he would go to the well in the church , if only he knew the way . the wolf told him to climb on his back . he would manage to find the way , said he . and then they were off as though they had wings , over rock and wood , over hill and dale . after they had been underway for many , many days , they at last reached the lake . then the king 's son did not know how they were to get across . but the wolf told him not to worry , and swam across with the prince to the island . then they came to the church . but the church - key hung high up in the tower , and at first the king 's son did not at all know how they were to get it down .
