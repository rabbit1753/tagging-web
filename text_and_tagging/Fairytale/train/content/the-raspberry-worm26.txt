otto felt rather ashamed : he quite understood what it meant , but he thought that the old man 's revenge was a noble one . the raspberry king had also remembered the big sister , for when she went in to set the table for dinner , she found eleven big baskets of most beautiful raspberries , and no one knew how they had come there , but everyone guessed . and so there was such a jam - making as had never been seen before , and if you like to go and help in it , you might perhaps get a little , for they must surely be making jam still to this very day .
