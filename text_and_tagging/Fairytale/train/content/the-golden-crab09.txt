then the king said to her , ' i will appoint a tournament in your honour , and i will invite all the princes in the world to it , and if any one of them pleases you , you shall marry him . ' in the evening the princess told this to the crab , who said to her , ' take this rod , go to the garden gate and knock with it , then a black man will come out and say to you , ' ' why have you called me , and what do you require of me ? ' answer him thus : ' your master the king has sent me hither to tell you to send him his golden armour and his steed and the silver apple . ' ' and bring them to me . ' the princess did so , and brought him what he desired .
