suddenly the portal closed with a great crash . then the maiden was much frightened , and regretted having done what had been forbidden her ; yet now she could not get out , and was compelled to follow the apple once more . it rolled far into the beautiful garden and stopped at a little fire - place , where stood two kettles of water , one small , the other large . there was a great fire burning under the large kettle ; but only a weak fire beneath the smaller one . now when the apple stopped there the maiden did not know what to do . then it occurred to her to scrape away the fire beneath the large kettle and thrust it under the little one ; and soon the kettle over the small fire began to boil and the kettle over the large one simmered down . but she could not stay there . and since she had already disobeyed the order given her , she expected to die , nothing less , and was quite resigned to do so , because she had lost all hope of winning the prince .
