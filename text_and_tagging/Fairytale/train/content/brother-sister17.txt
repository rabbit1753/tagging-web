now , when it was midnight , and every one was asleep , the nurse , who was sitting by the cradle in the nursery and watching there alone , saw the door open , and the true queen come in . she took the child out of the cradle , laid it in her bosom , and fed it . then she shook out its little pillow , put the child back again , and covered it with the coverlet . she did not forget the fawn either : she went to him where he lay in the corner , and stroked his back tenderly . then she went in perfect silence out at the door , and the nurse next morning asked the watchmen if any one had entered the castle during the night , but they said they had seen no one . and the queen came many nights , and never said a word ; the nurse saw her always , but she did not dare speak of it to any one . after some time had gone by in this manner , the queen seemed to find voice , and said one night , " my child my fawn twice more i come to see , twice more i come , and then the end must be .
