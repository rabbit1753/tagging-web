his brother and sister ran to meet him , and called out from the distance , ' where have you been so long , lasse ? come home and get some bread - and - butter . ' the kitchen door stood open , and inside was heard a strange frizzling . the gardener was near the gate , watering the dill and parsley , the carrots and parsnips . ' well , ' he said , ' where has little lasse been so long ? ' little lasse straightened himself up stiff , and answered : ' i have sailed round the world in a pea - shell boat . ' ' oh ! ' said the gardener . he has forgotten dreamland . but you have not forgotten it ; you know that it exists . you know the beautiful grotto and the bright silver walls whose lustre never fades , the sparkling diamonds which never grow dim , the music which never ceases its low , soft murmur through the sweet evening twilight . the airy fairy fancies of happy dreamland never grow old ; they , like the glorious stars above us , are always young . perhaps you have caught a glimpse of their ethereal wings as they flew around your pillow . perhaps you have met the same dream - boy with the blue eyes and the fair hair , the one who wore the red cap with the silver band and the white coat with pearls on the collar . perhaps he has taken you to see all the countries of the world and the peoples , the cold waste lands and the burning deserts , the many coloured men and the wild creatures in the sea and in the woods , so that you may earn many things , but come gladly home again . yes , who knows ? perhaps you also have sailed round the wide world once in a pea - shell boat .
