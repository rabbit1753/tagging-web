at length on his last little rush -- pickles found that the shop was empty . the policeman had disappeared . but the envelope remained . " do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman ? i am afraid it is a summons , " said pickles . " no , " replied ginger , who had opened the envelope , " it is the rates and taxes , 3 pounds , 19 shillings , 11 pence 3 farthings . " " this is the last straw , " said pickles , " let us close the shop . " they put up the shutters , and left . but they have not removed from the neighbourhood . in fact some people wish they had gone further . ginger is living in the warren . i do not know what occupation he pursues ; he looks stout and comfortable . pickles is at present a gamekeeper . the closing of the shop caused great inconvenience . tabitha twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half - penny ; and she continued to refuse to give credit . of course there are the trades - men 's carts -- the butcher , the fish - man and timothy baker . but a person can not live on " seed wigs " and sponge - cake and butter - buns -- not even when the sponge - cake is as good as timothy 's !
