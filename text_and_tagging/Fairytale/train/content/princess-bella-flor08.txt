' oh , sire ! the princess bella - flor- ' answered the man , and then stopped as if afraid . ' what of the princess bella - flor ? ' asked the king impatiently . ' i have heard - it is whispered at court - that your majesty desires to know where she lies in hiding . ' ' i would give half my kingdom to the man who will bring her to me , ' cried the king , eagerly . ' speak on , knave ; has a bird of the air revealed to you the secret ? ' ' it is not i , but my brother , who knows , ' replied the traitor ; ' if your majesty would ask him- ' but before the words were out of his mouth the king had struck a blow with his sceptre on a golden plate that hung on the wall . ' order jose to appear before me instantly , ' he shouted to the servant who ran to obey his orders , so great was the noise his majesty had made ; and when jose entered the hall , wondering what in the world could be the matter , the king was nearly dumb from rage and excitement . ' bring me the princess bella - flor this moment , ' stammered he , ' for if you return without her i will have you drowned ! ' and without another word he left the hall , leaving jose staring with surprise and horror . ' how can i find the princess bella - flor when i have never even seen her ? ' thought he . ' but it is no use staying here , for i shall only be put to death . ' and he walked slowly to the stables to choose himself a horse .
