there was a track of fire behind it . finn followed , and on the threshold of the enchanted palace he found the body of midna . he was quite dead , with the blood pouring through a wound in the middle of his back ; but the spear was gone . finn drew his sword and cut off the enchanter 's head , and returned with it to tara . when he came to the spot where he had dropped the mantle it was not seen , but smoke and flame issued there from a hole in the ground . that hole was twenty feet deep in the earth , and at the bottom of it there was a fire always from that night , and it was never extinguished . it was called the fire of the son of midna . it was in a depression on the north side of the hill of tara , called the glen of the mantle , glen - a - brat . they were astonished to find that tara was still standing , for though the night was dark , the palaces and temples , all of hewn timber , were brilliantly coloured and of many hues , for in those days men delighted in splendid colours . when the captains came together finn said , " i have slain midna . " " where is his head ? " they asked , not because they disbelieved him , but because the heads of men slain in battle were always brought away for trophies . " come and see , " answered finn . conn and his only son and gaul mac morna followed the young hero into the teck - midcuarta , where the spear - long waxen candles were still burning , and when they saw the head of midna impaled there at the end of the hall , the head of the man whom they believed to be immortal and not to be wounded or conquered , they were filled with great joy , and praised their deliverer and paid him many compliments .
