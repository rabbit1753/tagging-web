on the third morning the giant went off again with his goats . " to - day you must go to the devil , and fetch me his tribute , " said he to the king 's son . " when you have done that , you may rest for the remainder of the time , for you have come to a kind master , and you might as well know it , " and with that he went off . " you may be a kind master , " said the king 's son . " yet you hand over some pretty mean jobs to me in spite of it , but i think i 'll look after your master girl a bit . you claim that she belongs to you , but perhaps , in spite of it , she may tell me what to do , " and with that he went in to her . and when the master girl asked him what the giant had given him to do that day , he told her he must go to the devil and fetch a tribute . " but how will you go about it ? " asked the master girl . " you will have to tell me that , " said the king 's son , " for i have never been to the devil 's place . even though i knew the way there , i still would not know how much to ask for . " " i will tell you what you must do , " said the master girl . " you must go to the rock behind the pasture , and take the club that is lying there , and strike the rock with it . then one will come out whose eyes flash fire , and you must tell him your business . and if he asks how much you want , you must tell him as much as you can carry .
