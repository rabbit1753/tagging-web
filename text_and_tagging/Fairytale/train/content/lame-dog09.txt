when the time came for them to part , the youngest princess went back to her beautiful castle . the day passed like every other day . when evening came at last and the dog had gone to bed , the princess was so driven by curiosity that she could hardly wait until he had fallen asleep . then she rose , softly , lit her lamp , and drew near the bed to look at him while he slept . but no one can describe her astonishment when throwing the light on the bed , she saw no lame dog lying there ; but the handsomest youth her eyes had ever beheld . she could not stop looking at him ; but sat up all night bending over his pillow , and the more she looked at him the handsomer he seemed to grow , until she forgot everything else in the world . at last the morning came . and as the first star began to pale in the dawn , the youth began to grow restless and awaken . the princess much frightened , blew out her lamp and lay down in her bed . the youth thought she was sleeping and did not wish to wake her , so he rose quietly , assumed his other shape , went away and did not appear again all day long .
