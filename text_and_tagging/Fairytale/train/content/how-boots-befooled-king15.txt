there was the king , standing in the doorway , looking out into the street . when he saw boots coming towards him he made a wry face . " what ! " said he , " are you back again ? " oh , yes ! boots was back again . and now if the princess was ready he would like to go and find her , for lost time was not to be gathered again like fallen apples . so off they marched to a great room , and there stood eighty - and - one maidens , all as much alike as peas in the same dish . boots looked here and there , but , even if he had known the princess , he could not have told her from the others . but he was ready for all that . before any one knew what he was about , he opened the box , and out ran the little mouse among them all . then what a screaming , and a hubbub there was ! many looked as though they would have liked to swoon , but only one of them did so . as soon as the others saw what had happened , they forgot all about the mouse , and ran to her and fell to fanning her and slapping her hands and chafing her temples .
