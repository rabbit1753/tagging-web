" yes , here they are , " said the youth ; and he flung them on the table so that they rang . the princess could not have been more frightened had he thrown the shears in her face . but she tried to make the best of a bad bargain , and said in a sweet voice : " since you have taken such good care of the shears , you will not find it hard to keep my ball of gold twine for me . i should like to have it back by to - morrow noon . but if you can not give it to me then , you must die , according to the law . " the youth thought it would not be so very hard , and put the ball of gold twine in his pocket . yet the princess once more began to toy and joke with him , so that he thought neither of himself nor of the ball of gold twine , and while they were in the midst of their merry play she stole the golden ball from him , and then dismissed him . when he came up into his room , and told what she had said and done , his comrade asked : " and have you still the ball of gold twine ? " the comrade once more put on his three - sisters hat , and waited until the princess came with the horn of ointment and anointed the goat . then she repeated what she had already said : " up , up ! over gable and tower , over land and sea , over hill and dale , to my dearest who waits for me in the hill ! " and when the goat arose , the comrade swung himself up in back , and off they were like lightning through the air . soon they had reached the troll - hill , and when she had knocked thrice they passed through the interior of the hill till they met the troll who was her dearest . " what manner of care did you take of the golden shears i gave you yesterday , my friend ? " asked the princess . " the suitor had them , and he gave them back to me . "
