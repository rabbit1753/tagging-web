as owasso , with his convoy of birds , passed over , he let fall , directly in the face of the old magician , a capful of gulls ' eggs . they broke and so besmeared his eyes that he could barely see . he jumped up and exclaimed : " it is always so with these thoughtless birds . they never consider where they drop their eggs . " owasso had flown on and reached the lodge in safety , and , excusing himself for the liberty , he killed two or three of the gulls for the sake of their feathers to ornament his son 's head . when the magician arrived , soon after , his grandson came out to meet him , tossing his head about as the feathers danced and struggled with the wind . " where did you get these ? " asked the manito , " and who brought them ? " " my father brought them , " the boy replied . the old magician was quite distressed in his mind that he had not destroyed his son - in - law . he entered his lodge in silence , and set his wits busily at work again to contrive some plan for easing his feelings in that respect .
