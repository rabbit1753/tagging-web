he plucked this flower and went with it to the castle ; and there everything which he touched with the flower was freed from the enchantment , and he got his jorinde back again through it . when he awoke in the morning he began to seek mountain and valley to find such a flower . he sought it for eight days , and on the ninth early in the morning he found the blood - red flower . in its centre was a large dew - drop , as big as the most lovely pearl . he travelled day and night with this flower till he arrived at the castle . when he came within a hundred paces of it he did not cease to be able to move , but he went on till he reached the gate . he was delighted at his success , touched the great gate with the flower , and it sprung open . he entered , passed through the courtyard , and then stopped to listen for the singing of the birds ; at last he heard it . he went in and found the hall in which was the enchantress , and with her seven thousand birds in their wicker cages . when she saw joringel she was furious , and breathed out poison and gall at him , but she could not move a step towards him . he took no notice of her , and went and looked over the cages of birds ; but there were many hundred nightingales , and how was he to find his jorinde from among them ?
