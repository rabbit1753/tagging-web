with that she took her golden armlet from her arm and laid it on the aching place . she pressed it down very gently , and the swelling rose a full inch above the armlet so that it enclosed the entire swelling . then she loosed a pen - knife with a blade as thin as paper from her silken girdle . with one hand she held the armlet , and with the other she took the knife and lightly passed it around the bottom of the ring . black blood gushed forth and ran over mattress and bed . but young kung was so enchanted by the presence of the beautiful giauna that not only did he feel no pain , but his one fear was that the whole affair might end too soon , and that she would disappear from his sight . in a moment the diseased flesh had been cut away , and giauna had fresh water brought and cleansed the wound . then she took a small red pellet from her mouth , and laid it on the wound , and when she turned around in a circle , it seemed to kung as though she drew out all the inflammation in steam and flames . once more she turned in a circle , and he felt his wound itch and quiver , and when she turned for the third time , he was completely cured .
