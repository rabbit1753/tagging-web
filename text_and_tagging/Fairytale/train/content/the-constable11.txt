the inn - keeper replied : " the constable of the temple of the great mountain appeared to me last night and said : ' to - morrow a man by the name of dung who is a good friend of mine is coming from the bay of kaiutschou ! ' and then he described your appearance and your clothes to me exactly , and told me to make careful note of them , and when you came to treat you with the greatest consideration , and to take no pay from you , since he would repay me lavishly . so when i saw you coming everything was exactly as my dreams had foretold , and i knew you at once . i have already prepared a quiet room for you , and beg that you will condescend to make yourself at ease . " joyfully dung followed him , and the inn - keeper waited on him with the greatest consideration , and saw that he had great plenty to eat and to drink . at midnight the spirit arrived . without having opened the door , he stood by dung 's bedside , gave him his hand , and asked how things had gone with him since he had last seen him . dung answered all his questions and thanked him into the bargain for appearing to the inn - keeper in a dream . he continued to live for some days at the inn . during the day he went walking on the great mountain and at night his friend came to visit him and talked with him , and at the same time asked him what had happened to sir wang .
