but many speak truth and do not know it ! thus it chanced with the king 's daughters ; since before the year had come to an end , each had the suitor for whom she had wished . a man with golden hair and golden beard sued for the oldest princess and won her consent to his suit . and a man with silver hair and a silver beard sued for the second and she became his bride ; but the youngest princess had no other suitor than a lame dog . then she recalled her talk with her sisters in their room , and thought to herself : " may god aid me in the marriage into which i must enter ! " yet she would not break the word she had once passed ; but followed her sisters ' example and accepted the dog . the wedding lasted a number of days and was celebrated with great pomp and splendor . but while the guests danced and amused themselves , the youngest princess sat apart and wept , and when the others were laughing , her tears flowed till it made one sad to see them .
