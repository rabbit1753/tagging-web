' and the mother said , ' hush ! thou beast of ill - omen ! wilt thou make me burst with misery ? ' next the cat on the roof saw her , and called out ' miaouw ! miaouw ! see here comes letiko ! ' and the mother said , ' keep silence ! thou beast of ill - omen ! wilt thou make me burst with misery ? ' then the cock spied , and called out : ' cock - a - doodle - do ! see here comes letiko ! ' and the mother said again : ' be quiet ! thou bird of ill - omen ! wilt thou make me burst with misery ? '
