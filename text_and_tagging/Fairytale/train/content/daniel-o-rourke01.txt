people may have heard of the renowned adventures of daniel o'rourke , but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils , above and below , was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the pooka 's tower . i knew the man well . he lived at the bottom of hungry hill , just at the right - hand side of the road as you go towards bantry . an old man was he at the time he told me the story , with grey hair and a red nose ; and it was on the 25th of june , 1813 , that i heard it from his own lips , as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar tree , on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky . i was going to visit the caves in dursey island , having spent the morning at glengariff .
