" ah , " said the wild man , " if that be all you want , then i can help you ! you helped me once before and now i will help you in turn . " then he took the prince by the hand , led him deep down into the earth into his cave , and behold , there hung a suit of armor forged out of the hardest steel , and so bright that a blue gleam played all around it . right beside it stood a splendid steed , saddled and bridled , pawing the earth with his steel hoofs , and champing his bit till the white foam dropped to the ground . the wild man said : " now get quickly into your armor , ride out and try your luck ! in the meantime i will tend your oxen . " the prince did not wait to be told a second time ; but put on helmet and armor , buckled on his spurs , hung his sword at his side , and felt as light in his steel armor as a bird in the air . then he leaped into the saddle so that every clasp and buckle rang , laid his reins on the neck of his steed , and rode hastily toward the mountain .
