when the day came , the bracket bull said , " take the horn off me and eat your enough -- that 's the last luck you have . i am to fight with the other bull immediately , and i shall escape from him to - day , but he will have me dead to - morrow by twelve o'clock . " himself and the other bull fought that day , and the bracket bull came back in the evening , and he himself and the lad passed that night in the wood . when the next day came , the bracket bull said to him , " twist the horn off me and eat your enough -- that 's the last luck you 'll have . listen now to the thing that i 'm telling you . when you 'll see me dead , go and cut a strip of skin of the back and a strip of the stomach off me , and make a belt of it , and at any time at all there will be any hard pinch on you , you shall have my power . " the bracket bull went then to fight with the other bull , and the other bull killed him . the other bull went away then . the lad came to the bracket bull where he was lying on the ground , and he was not dead , out - and - out . when he saw the boy coming he said , " oh , " said he , " make haste as well as you can in the world , and take out your knife and cut that strip off me , or you will be killed as well as myself .
