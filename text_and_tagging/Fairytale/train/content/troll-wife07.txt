she went into the smithy , and the first thing she did was to take the horse - shoe in both hands and bend it straight . " there , look at it , " said she , " that is how you must do it . " and with that she bent it together again as though it were made of lead . " now hold up the horse 's leg , " said she , and the horse - shoe fitted to a hair , so that the best farrier could not have bettered it . " you have a great deal of strength in your fingers , " said her husband , and he looked at her . " do you think so ? " was her reply . " what would have happened to me had you been as strong ? but i love you far too dearly ever to use my strength against you , " said she . and from that day on he was the best of husbands .
