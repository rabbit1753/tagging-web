morraha rose in the morning , and washed his hands and face , and said his prayers , and ate his food . he asked god to prosper the day for him ; and he went down to the brink of the sea , and he saw a currach , short and green , coming towards him . in it there was but one youthful champion , and he playing hurly from prow to stern of the currach . he had a hurl of gold and a ball of silver . he stopped not until the currach was in on the shore . he drew her up on the green grass , and put fastening on her for a day and a year , whether he should be there all that time , or should only be on land for an hour by the clock . and morraha saluted the young man in words intelligent , intelligible , such as were spoken at that time . the other saluted him in the same fashion , and asked him would he play a game of cards with him ; and morraha said he had not the wherewithal . the other answered that he was never without a candle or the making of it . he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a table and two chairs and a pack of cards , and they sat down on the chairs and went to the card - playing . the first game morraha won , and the slender red champion bade him make his claim . he said that the land above him should be filled with stock of sheep in the morning . it was well , and he played no second game , but home he went . the next day morraha went to the brink of the sea , and the young man came in the currach and asked him would he play cards . they played , and morraha won . and the young man bade him make his claim . he said that the land above should be filled with cattle in the morning . it was well , and he played no other game , but went home .
