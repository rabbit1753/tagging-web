well , it was all mighty good as long as the king had his health . but , you see , in coorse o ' time , the king grew old , by reason he was stiff in his limbs , and when he got stricken in years , his heart failed him . he was lost entirely for want o ' diversions , because he could n't go a huntin ' no longer . by dad , the poor king was obliged at last for to get a goose to distract him . you see , the goose used for to swim across the lake , and go down divin ' for trout ( and not finer trout in all ireland than the same trout ) and catch fish on a friday for the king . if flew every other day round about the lake disctracting the poor king that you 'd think he 'd break his sides laughin ' at the frolicksome tricks of his goose . so , in course o ' time , the goose was the greatest pet in the country , and the biggest rogue , and distracted the king to no end . the poor king was as happy as the day was long . so that 's the way it was . all went on mighty well until , by dad , the goose got stricken in years , as well as the king , and grew stiff in the limbs , like her master , and could n't distract him no longer . then it was that the poor king was lost completely , and did n't know what in the wide world to do . he was gone out of all distractions because the goose was no more in the flower of her blume . well , the king was nigh broken - hearted and melancholy entirely , and was walkin ' one mornin ' by the edge of the lake , lamentin ' his cruel fate , an ' thinkin ' o ' drownin ' himself , that could get no diversion in life , when all of a sudden , turnin ' round the corner beyond , who should he meet but a mighty decent young man comin ' up to him .
