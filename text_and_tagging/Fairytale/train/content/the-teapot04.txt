all this said the teapot in its fresh young life . it stood on the table that was spread for tea ; it was lifted by a very delicate hand , but the delicate hand was awkward . the teapot fell , the spout snapped off , and the handle snapped off . the lid was no worse to speak of ; the worst had been spoken of that . the teapot lay in a swoon on the floor , while the boiling water ran out of it . it was a horrid shame , but the worst was that everybody jeered at it ; they jeered at the teapot and not at the awkward hand . " i never shall forget that experience , " said the teapot , when it afterward talked of its life . " i was called an invalid , and placed in a corner , and the next day was given to a woman who begged for victuals . i fell into poverty , and stood dumb both outside and in . but then , just as i was , began my better life . one can be one thing and still become quite another . " earth was placed in me . for a teapot , this is the same as being buried , but in the earth was placed a flower bulb . who placed it there , who gave it , i know not ; but given it was , and it became a compensation for the chinese leaves and the boiling water , a compensation for the broken handle and spout . " and the bulb lay in the earth , the bulb lay in me ; it became my heart , my living heart , such as i had never before possessed . there was life in me , power and might . the heart pulsed , and the bulb put forth sprouts ; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower .
