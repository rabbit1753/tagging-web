now the old lady fell ill , and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again . she had to be nursed and waited upon , and this was no one 's duty more than karen 's . but there was a grand ball in the town , and karen was invited . she looked at the red shoes , saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that ; she put the red shoes on , thinking there was no harm in that either ; and then she went to the ball ; and commenced to dance . but when she wanted to go to the right , the shoes danced to the left , and when she wanted to dance up the room , the shoes danced down the room , down the stairs through the street , and out through the gates of the town . she danced , and was obliged to dance , far out into the dark wood . suddenly something shone up among the trees , and she believed it was the moon , for it was a face . but it was the old soldier with the red beard ; he sat there nodding his head and said : " dear me , what pretty dancing shoes !
