the wild boar got up in a dreadful fright , gave one loud grunt and disappeared into the wood . but the cat was even more startled than the boar , and , spitting with terror , she scrambled up into the fork of the tree , and as it happened right into the bear 's face . now it was the bear 's turn to be alarmed , and with a mighty growl he jumped down from the oak and fell right on the top of the wolf and killed him as dead as a stone . on their way home from the war the fox caught score of mice , and when they reached simon 's cottage he put them all on the stove and said to the cat , ' now go and fetch one mouse after the other , and lay them down before your master . ' ' all right , ' said the cat , and did exactly as the fox told her .
