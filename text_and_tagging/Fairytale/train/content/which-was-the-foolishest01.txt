in a little village that stood on a wide plain , where you could see the sun from the moment he rose to the moment he set , there lived two couples side by side . the men , who worked under the same master , were quite good friends , but the wives were always quarrelling , and the subject they quarrelled most about was -- which of the two had the stupidest husband . unlike most women -- who think that anything that belongs to them must be better than what belongs to anyone else -- each thought her husband the more foolish of the two .
