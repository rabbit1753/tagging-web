the farmer 's wife tried to comfort her , and miss muffet , between her sobs , said she had seen " the awfulest , biggest , blackest spider in all the world ! " this made the woman laugh , for she was not afraid of spiders . soon after they heard a sound of wheels upon the road and a handsome carriage came dashing up to the gate . " has anyone seen a little girl who has run away ? " asked nurse holloweg , leaning out of the carriage . " oh , yes , " answered little miss muffet ; " here i am , nurse . " and she ran out and jumped into the carriage , for she was very glad to get back again to those who would care for her and not ask her to work making cheeses .
