after a time he lay down on his back , and prepared to go to sleep . but just then the ring slipped down his throat , and he had to cough , so that the ring flew out and rolled along the ground . swish!--the rat had caught it , and crept out with it to the cat , who was waiting at the rat - hole . but in the meantime the king had caught the youth , and had had him put in a great tower and condemned to death , because he had made a mock of his daughter -- so the king said . and the youth was to sit in the tower until he was beheaded . but the cat kept prowling around the tower all the time , trying to sneak in with the ring . and then an eagle came along , caught her up in his claws and flew across the sea with her . and suddenly a hawk appeared , and flung himself on the eagle , and the eagle let the cat fall into the sea . when she felt the water , she grew afraid , let the ring fall , and swam to land . no sooner had she shaken the water from her fur than she met the dog whom the youth 's master had bought for him . " well , what am i to do now ? " said the cat , and wept and lamented . " the ring is gone , and they want to murder the youth . " " that i do not know , " said the dog , " but what i do know is that i have the very worst kind of an ache in my stomach , " said he .
