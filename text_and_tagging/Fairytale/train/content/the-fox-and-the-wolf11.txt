time went on , and the hungry spring came , and the fox and the wolf had their larder bare , for food was scarce , and the weather was bleak and cold . " let us go and dig up the keg of butter , " said the wolf . " methinks that now is the time we need it . " the fox agreed -- having made up his mind how he would act -- and the two set out to the place where the keg had been hidden . they scraped away the sand , and uncovered it ; but , needless to say , they found it empty . " this is your work , " said the fox angrily , turning to the poor , innocent wolf . " you have crept along here while i was at the christenings , and eaten it up by stealth . " " not i , " replied the wolf . " i have never been near the spot since the day that we buried it together . " " but i tell you it must have been you , " insisted the fox , " for no other creature knew it was there except ourselves . and , besides , i can see by the sleekness of your fur that you have fared well of late . "
