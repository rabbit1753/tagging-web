maidwa 's pack for traveling was now ready , and he was taking his farewell smoke , when the young magician thus addressed him : " my friend maidwa , you know for what cause you came thus far , and why you have risked so much and waited so long . you have proved my friend indeed . you have accomplished your object , and your noble perseverance shall not go unrewarded . if you undertake other things with the same spirit , you will always succeed . my destiny compels me to remain where i am , although i should feel happy to be allowed to go with you . i have given you , of ordinary gifts , all you will need as long as you live ; but i see you are backward to speak of the red swan . i vowed that whoever procured me my lost wampum - scalp should be rewarded by possessing the red swan . " he then spoke in a language which maidwa did not understand , the curtain of the lodge parted , and the red swan met his gaze . it was a beautiful female that he beheld , so majestical and airy in her look , that he seemed to see a creature whose home should rather be in the free heaven , and among the rosy clouds , than in this dusky lodge . " take her , " the young magician said ; " she is my sister ; treat her well . she is worthy of you , and what you have done for me merits more . she is ready to go with you to your kindred and friends , and has been so ever since your arrival ; and my good wishes shall go with you both . " the red swan smiled kindly on maidwa , who advanced and greeted her . hand in hand they took their way forth from the lodge , and , watched by the young magician , advanced across the prairie on their homeward course .
