when they came ashore , murmur sent to the king , and had him told to have the sword fetched ; but though the king sent four horses , they could not move it from the spot . he sent eight , he sent twelve , but the sword remained where it was , and could not be moved from the spot by any means . then murmur goose - egg took it up , and carried it alone . the king could not believe his eyes when he saw murmur once more ; but he was very friendly and promised him gold and green forests . but when murmur asked for more work , he told him to travel to his troll 's castle , where no one dared go , and to remain there until he had built a bridge across the sound , so that people could cross . if he could do that , he would reward him well , yes , he would even give him his daughter , said the king . he would attend to it , said murmur .
