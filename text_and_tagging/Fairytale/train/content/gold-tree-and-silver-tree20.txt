now the servants worshipped the ground that their young mistress trod on . she was always kind and considerate to them . when they saw how frightened she was , and heard her piteous words , they crowded round her , as if to shield her from any harm that threatened her . " do not be afraid , your highness , " they cried ; " we will defend thee with our very lives if need be . but in case thy lady step - mother should have the power to throw any evil spell over thee , we will lock you in the great mullioned chamber . then she can not get nigh thee at all . " now the mullioned chamber was a strong - room , which was in a part of the castle all by itself . its door was so thick that no one could possibly break through it . the princess knew that if she were once inside the room , with its stout oaken door between her and her step - mother , she would be perfectly safe from any mischief that that wicked woman could devise . so she consented to her faithful servants ' suggestion , and allowed them to lock her in the mullioned chamber . so it came to pass that when queen silver - tree arrived at the great door of the castle , and commanded the lackey who opened it to take her to his royal mistress . he told her , with a low bow , that that was impossible , because the princess was locked in the strong - room of the castle . she could not get out , because no one knew where the key was . ( which was quite true , for the old butler had tied it round the neck of the prince 's favourite sheep - dog . he had sent him away to the hills to seek his master . )
