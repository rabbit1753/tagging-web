when the king 's daughters were once reunited , they were naturally very happy , and there were a great many questions asked about matters old and new . and marriage was also discussed . the oldest princess said : " it was silly of me to wish for a husband with golden hair and golden beard ; for mine is worse than the veriest troll , and i have not known a happy day since we married . " and the second went on : " yes , and i am no better off ; for although i have a husband with silver hair and a silver beard , he dislikes me so heartily that he begrudges me a single hour of happiness . " then her sisters turned to the youngest princess and asked how she fared . " well , " was her answer , " i really can not complain ; for though i only got a lame dog , he is such a dear good fellow and so kind to me that it would be hard to find a better husband . "
