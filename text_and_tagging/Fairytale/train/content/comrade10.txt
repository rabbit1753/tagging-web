" sit down yourself ! " said the comrade . and what had happened to her sister happened to her , she had to seat herself , and could not get up again . in the meantime the youth and his comrade went about in the hill , and the latter opened all the closets and drawers , until he found what he had been searching for , a ball of golden twine . this he wished to have , and promised he would release her from the chair if she would give it to him . she told him he might have all she possessed ; but that she could not give him the ball , since it was her three - sisters ball . but when she heard that she would have to sit in the chair till the day of judgment , she changed her mind . then the comrade took the ball , and in spite of it left her sitting where she was . then they wandered for many a day through wood and heath , until they came to a wall of rock . all happened as it had twice before , the comrade knocked , the hill opened , and inside a witch came to meet them with a chair , and bade them sit down . the two had gone through many rooms before the comrade spied an old hat hanging on a hook behind the door . the hat he must have , but the old witch would not part with it , since it was her three - sisters hat , and if she gave it away she would be thoroughly unhappy . but when she heard that she would have to sit there until the day of judgment if she did not give up the hat , she at last agreed to do so . the comrade took the hat , and then told her to keep on sitting where she sat , like her sisters .
