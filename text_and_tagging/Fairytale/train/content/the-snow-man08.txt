' yours is a bad illness for a snow - man ! ' said the yard - dog . ' i also suffered from it , but i have got over it . bow - wow ! ' he barked . ' the weather is going to change ! ' he added . the weather did change . there came a thaw . when this set in the snow - man set off . he did not say anything , and he did not complain , and those are bad signs . one morning he broke up altogether . and lo ! where he had stood there remained a broomstick standing upright , round which the boys had built him ! ' ah ! now i understand why he loved the stove , ' said the yard - dog . ' that is the raker they use to clean out the stove ! the snow - man had a stove - raker in his body ! that 's what was the matter with him ! and now it 's all over with him ! bow - wow ! ' and before long it was all over with the winter too ! ' bow - wow ! ' barked the hoarse yard - dog . but the young girl sang : woods , your bright green garments don ! willows , your woolly gloves put on ! lark and cuckoo , daily sing- february has brought the spring ! my heart joins in your song so sweet ; come out , dear sun , the world to greet ! and no one thought of the snow - man .
