the old woman went accordingly , and laid the matter before the king , who laughed a little at the notion of his daughter marrying a crab , but did not decline the proposal altogether , because he was a prudent monarch , and knew that the crab was likely to be a prince in disguise . he said , therefore , to the fisherman 's wife , ' go , old woman , and tell the crab i will give him my daughter if by to - morrow morning he can build a wall in front of my castle much higher than my tower , upon which all the flowers of the world must grow and bloom . ' the fisherman 's wife went home and gave this message . then the crab gave her a golden rod , and said , ' go and strike with this rod three times upon the ground on the place which the king showed you , and to - morrow morning the wall will be there . ' the old woman did so and went away again .
