ribby and duchess said good - bye affectionately , and duchess started home . half - way up the lane she stopped and looked back ; ribby had gone in and shut her door . duchess slipped through the fence , and ran round to the back of ribby 's house , and peeped into the yard . upon the roof of the pig - stye sat dr . maggotty and three jackdaws . the jackdaws were eating pie - crust , and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty - pan . " gammon , ha , ha ! " he shouted when he saw duchess 's little black nose peeping round the corner . duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly ! when ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea - things , she found a pink and white pie - dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard . the patty - pan was under the pump , where dr maggotty had considerately left it . ribby stared with amazement--"did you ever see the like ! so there really was a patty - pan ? .... but my patty - pans are all in the kitchen cupboard . well i never did ! .... next time i want to give a party -- i will invite cousin tabitha twitchit !
