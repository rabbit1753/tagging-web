there was once a proud teapot ; it was proud of being porcelain , proud of its long spout , proud of its broad handle . it had something before and behind,--the spout before and the handle behind,--and that was what it talked about . but it did not talk of its lid , which was cracked and riveted ; these were defects , and one does not talk of one 's defects , for there are plenty of others to do that . the cups , the cream pot , and the sugar bowl , the whole tea service , would think much oftener of the lid 's imperfections -- and talk about them -- than of the sound handle and the remarkable spout . the teapot knew it .
