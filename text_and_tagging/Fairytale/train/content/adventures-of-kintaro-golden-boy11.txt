the deer with long horns and the hare with long ears , it must have been an amusing sight to those who watched this queer match . suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees , and the bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten . in this way , sometimes the one , sometimes the other , conquering , the little party amused themselves till they were tired . at last kintaro got up and said : " this is enough for to - day . what a nice place we have found for wrestling ! let us come again to - morrow . now , we will all go home . come along ! " so saying , kintaro led the way while the animals followed . after walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a valley . kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing . bridge there was none . the river rushed " don , don " on its way . all the animals looked serious , wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening .
