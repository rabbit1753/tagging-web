the two snakes looked at each other in dismay . the ring and the casket were the only things they did not want her to have . then after a short pause they spoke . ' why do you want the ring and casket so much ? who has told you of them ? ' ' oh , nobody ; it is just my fancy , ' answered she . but the old snakes shook their heads and replied : ' not so ; it is our son who told you , and , as he said , so it must be . if you need food , or clothes , or a house , tell the ring and it will find them for you . and if you are unhappy or in danger , tell the casket and it will set things right . ' then they both gave her their blessing , and she picked up her baby and went her way . she walked for a long time , till at length she came near the town where her husband and his father dwelt . here she stopped under a grove of palm trees , and told the ring that she wanted a house .
