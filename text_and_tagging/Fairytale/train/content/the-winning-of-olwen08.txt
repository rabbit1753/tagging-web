then glewlwyd went into the hall , and arthur said to him : ' do you have news from the gate ? ' and the porter answered : ' far have i travelled , both in this island and elsewhere , and many kingly men have i seen ; but never yet have i beheld one equal in majesty to him who now stands at the door . ' ' if walking you did enter here , return you running , ' replied arthur , ' and let everyone that opens and shuts the eye show him respect and serve him , for it is not meet to keep such a man in the wind and rain . ' so glewlwyd unbarred the gate and kilweh rode in upon his charger . ' greeting to you , o ruler of this land , ' cried he , ' and greeting no less to the lowest than to the highest . ' ' greeting to you also , ' answered arthur . ' sit between two of my warriors , and you shall have minstrels before you and all that belongs to one born to be a king , while you remain in my palace . '
