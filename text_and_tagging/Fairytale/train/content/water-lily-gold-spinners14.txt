full of doubt and fear , the prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden . then a crow said to him : " why do you hesitate ? the old wizard has not told you wrong , neither have the birds deceived you ; hasten and dry the maiden 's tears . " " nothing worse than death can befall me , " thought the prince , " and death is better than endless sorrow . " so he mounted his horse and went to the bridge . again he heard the water - lily 's lament , and , hesitating no longer , smeared himself all over with mud , and , saying : " from a man into a crab , " plunged into the river . for one moment the water hissed in his ears , and then all was silent . he swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots , but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time . he then grasped them and rose to the surface , letting the water flow over the flower . the current carried them down the stream , but nowhere could he see the mountain ash . at last he saw it , and close by the large stone . here he stopped and said : " from a crab into a man , from a water - lily into a maiden , " and to his delight found himself once more a prince , and the maiden was by his side . she was ten times more beautiful than before , and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe , sparkling with jewels . she thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch 's power , and willingly consented to marry him .
