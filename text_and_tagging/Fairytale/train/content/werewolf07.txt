from that day forward the princess gave her father no peace , and begged him again and again to marry the good court lady . yet he did not want to marry her . but the king 's daughter gave him no rest . she urged him again and again , as the false court lady had persuaded her to do . finally , one day , when she again brought up the matter , the king cried : " i can see you will end by having your own way about this , even though it be entirely against my will . but i will do so only on one condition . " " what is the condition ? " asked the princess . " if i marry again , " said the king , " it is only because of your ceaseless pleading . therefore you must promise that , if in the future you are not satisfied with your step - mother or your step - sisters , not a single lament or complaint on your part reaches my ears . " this she promised the king , and it was agreed that he should marry the court lady and make her queen of the whole country .
