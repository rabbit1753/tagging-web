when they had finished tea , they tied up the clothes in bundles ; and lucie 's pocket - handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny , and fastened with a silver safety - pin . and then they made up the fire with turf , and came out and locked the door , and hid the key under the door - sill . then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs . tiggy - winkle with the bundles of clothes ! all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them ; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny ! and she gave them their nice clean clothes ; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs . tiggy - winkle .
