" now she is yours , my proud dragoon ! take her up before you on your horse , and ride into town and marry her . and you need only set the table for us in the little room in the bake - house ; for we do not want to be with the other wedding - guests , " said the old monster , her father , " but when the dishes make the round , you can stop in where we are . " he did not dare do anything else , and took her up before him on his horse , and made ready to marry her . but before she went to church , the bride begged one of the bridesmaids to stand close behind her , so that no one could see her tail fall off when the priest joined their hands . so the wedding was celebrated , and when the dishes made the round , the bridegroom went out into the room where the table had been set for the old folk from the mountain . and at that time there was nothing to be seen there ; but after the wedding - guests had gone , there was so much gold and silver , and such a pile of money lying there , as he had never seen together before .
