so boots crawled out of the sack , and the councillor paid his hundred dollars and crawled in . as soon as he was in all snug and safe , boots drew the mouth of the sack together and tied it tightly . then he flung sack , councillor , and all over his shoulder , and started away to the king 's house , and anybody who met them could see with half an eye that the councillor was going against his will . when boots came to the king 's castle he laid the councillor down in the goose - house , and then he went to the king . when the king saw boots again , he bit his lips with vexation . " well , " said he , " have you fooled the councillor ? " " oh , yes ! " says boots , " i have done that . " and where was the councillor now ? oh , boots had just left him down in the goose - house . he was tied up safe and sound in a sack , waiting till the king should send for him . so the councillor was sent for , and when he came the king saw at once that he had been brought against his will . " and now may i marry the princess ? " said boots .
