' help ! ' cried the antelope , ' for i was doing no harm , yet i have been caught . i would have been eaten , had i not defended myself . ' ' help me , ' said the python , ' for i am insato , king of all the reptiles , and will reward you well ! ' gopani - kufa considered for a moment , then stabbing the antelope with his assegai , he set the python free . ' i thank you , ' said the python . ' come back here with the new moon , when i shall have eaten the antelope , and i will reward you as i promised . ' ' yes , ' said the dying antelope , ' he will reward you , and lo ! your reward shall be your own undoing ! '
