the flax was in full bloom . it had pretty little blue flowers , as delicate as the wings of a moth . the sun shone on it and the showers watered it . this was as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mothers . they look much prettier for it , and so did the flax . " people say that i look exceedingly well , " said the flax , " and that i am so fine and long that i shall make a beautiful piece of linen . how fortunate i am ! it makes me so happy to know that something can be made of me . how the sunshine cheers me , and how sweet and refreshing is the rain ! my happiness overpowers me ! no one in the world can feel happier than i.
