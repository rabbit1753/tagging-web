sylvia was glad to have leisure to think , for she could not make up her mind at all what she should ask for herself , and the time was drawing very near . however , before very long the fairy sent her to phyllida , and waited for her report with unabated interest . ' i reached her court safely , ' said sylvia , ' and she received me with much kindness , and immediately began to exercise upon me that brilliant wit which you had bestowed upon her . i confess that i was fascinated by it , and for a week thought that nothing could be more desirable . the time passed like magic , so great was the charm of her society . but i ended by ceasing to covet that gift more than any of the others i have seen , for , like the gift of pleasing , it can not really give satisfaction . by degrees i wearied of what had so delighted me at first , especially as i perceived more and more plainly that it is impossible to be constantly smart and amusing without being frequently ill - natured , and too apt to turn all things , even the most serious , into mere occasions for a brilliant jest . ' the fairy in her heart agreed with sylvia 's conclusions , and felt pleased with herself for having brought her up so well .
