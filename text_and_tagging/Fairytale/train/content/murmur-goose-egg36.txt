when they came ashore , murmur sent to the king , and had him told to have the sword fetched ; but though the king sent four horses , they could not move it from the spot . he sent eight , he sent twelve , but the sword remained where it was , and could not be moved from the spot by any means . then murmur goose - egg took it up , and carried it alone . the king could not believe his eyes when he saw murmur once more ; but he was very friendly and promised him gold and green forests . but when murmur asked for more work , he told him to travel to his troll 's castle , where no one dared go , and to remain there until he had built a bridge across the sound , so that people could cross . if he could do that , he would reward him well , yes , he would even give him his daughter , said the king . he would attend to it , said murmur . then the king came to see whether murmur goose - egg were lying crushed on the ground , or had merely been badly beaten . he had to wade through piles of money before he could reach the bed . the money was stacked up high along the walls in heaps and in bags , and murmur lay in the bed and snored . " may heaven help me and my daughter ! " cried the king , when he saw that murmur goose - egg was in the best of health . yes , and no one could deny that everything had been well and thoroughly done , said the king . there could be no talk of marriage as long as the bridge had not been built . then one day the bridge was finished ; and on it stood the devil , ready to collect the toll promised him .
