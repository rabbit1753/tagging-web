' halloa ! you turkish nurse , ' said he , ' what is that great castle there close to the town ? the one with the windows so high up ? ' ' the sultan 's daughter lives there , ' she replied . ' it is prophesied that she will be very unlucky in her husband , and so no one is allowed to see her except when the sultan and sultana are by .
