' i certainly think that there will not be more than two , ' said jonas , ' there are never more than two when they slay children and rams . walter can very well shake them without me . ' ' but , you see , jonas , ' said walter , ' if there are two , it might still happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg . you see i am not so strong in the left hand as in the right . you can very well come with me , and take a good stick in case there are really two . look , if there is only one , i shall take him so with both my hands and thrown him living on to his back . he can kick as much as he likes , i shall hold him fast . ' ' now , when i really think over the thing , ' said jonas , ' i am almost sure there will not be more than one . what would two do with one ram ? there will certainly not be more than one . ' ' but you should come with me all the same , jonas , ' said walter . ' you see i can very well manage one , but i am not quite accustomed to wolves yet , and he might tear holes in my new trousers . ' ' well , just listen , ' said jonas , ' i am beginning to think that walter is not so brave as people say . first of all walter would fight against four , and then against three , then two , and then one , and now walter wants help with one . such a thing must never be . what would people say ? perhaps they would think that walter is a coward ?
