the next morning the giant got up early , and went into the forest . no sooner had he gone than the prince and the king 's daughter set about looking for his heart in the wardrobe . yet no matter how much they looked , they did not find it . " well , well , " said the princess , " we will have to try once more . " then she adorned the wardrobe with flowers and wreaths , and toward evening the king 's youngest son again crawled under the bed . then the giant came : " hu hu , it smells of human flesh here ! " he cried . " yes , " said the princess . " a jackdaw just this moment flew by with a human bone in her beak , and she let it fall down the chimney . i threw it out again at once , but it may be that you can still smell it . " when the giant heard this , he had nothing further to say about it . but not long afterward he noticed that the wardrobe was adorned with flowers and wreaths , and asked who had done it . " i , " said the princess . " what do you mean by such tomfoolery ? " asked the giant . " o , i am so fond of you that i had to do it , since i know that is where your heart lies , " was the reply of the princess . " are you really so stupid as to believe that ? " cried the giant . " yes , surely , i must believe it , " said the princess , " when you tell me so . " " how silly you are , " said the giant , " you could never reach the place where i keep my heart . " " but still i would like to know where it is , " answered the princess . then the giant could no longer resist , and at last had to tell her the truth . " far , far away , in a lake there lies an island , " said he , " and on the island stands a church , and in the church there is a well , and in the well floats a duck , and in the duck there is an egg , and in the egg it is my heart !
