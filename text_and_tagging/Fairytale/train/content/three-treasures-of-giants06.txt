the door of the castle stood open , and they entered a great hall , and looked about them . not a creature was to be seen , and suddenly martin - he did not know why - felt a little frightened . he would have left the castle at once , but stopped when jack boldly walked up to a door in the wall and opened it . he could not for very shame be outdone by his younger brother , and passed behind him into another splendid hall , which was filled from floor to ceiling with great pieces of copper money . the sight quite dazzled martin and michael , who emptied all the provisions that remained out of their bags , and heaped them up instead with handfuls of copper .
