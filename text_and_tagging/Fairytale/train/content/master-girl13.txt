but when he got home to the castle , one of his brothers was just getting married , and the bride and all the guests were already there . they all crowded around him and asked him this , and asked him that , and wanted to lead him in . but he acted as though he saw none of them , led out the horses , and began to put them to the coach . and since they could by no manner of means induce him to come into the castle , they came out with food and drink , and offered him the best of all that had been prepared for the wedding feast . but the king 's son would taste nothing , and only made haste in order to get away . yet , finally , the bride 's sister rolled an apple over to him across the court - yard : " and if you will touch nothing else , then at least you might take a bite of the apple , for you must be hungry and thirsty after your long journey , " said she , and he took the apple and bit into it . but no sooner did he have the bit of apple in his mouth than he had forgotten the master girl , and that he was to fetch her . " i think i must be going mad ! what am i doing with the horses and the coach ? " he said , and he led back the horses into the stable , and went back to the castle , and wanted to marry the bride 's sister , the one who had thrown him the apple .
