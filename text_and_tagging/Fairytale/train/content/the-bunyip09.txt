the little bunyip was carried home by its mother , and after that the waters sank back to their own channels . the side of the pool where she lives is always shunned by everyone , as nobody knows when she may suddenly put out her head and draw him into her mighty jaws . but people say that underneath the black waters of the pool she has a house filled with beautiful things , such as mortals who dwell on the earth have no idea of . though how they know i can not tell you , as nobody has ever seen it .
