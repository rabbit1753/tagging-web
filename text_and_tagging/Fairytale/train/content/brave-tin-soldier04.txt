when evening came , the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box , and the people of the house went to bed . then the playthings began to have their own games together , to pay visits , to have sham fights , and to give balls . the tin soldiers rattled in their box ; they wanted to get out and join the amusements , but they could not open the lid . the nut - crackers played at leap - frog , and the pencil jumped about the table . there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk , and in poetry too . only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places . she stood on tiptoe , with her legs stretched out , as firmly as he did on his one leg . he never took his eyes from her for even a moment . the clock struck twelve , and , with a bounce , up sprang the lid of the snuff - box ; but , instead of snuff , there jumped up a little black goblin ; for the snuff - box was a toy puzzle .
