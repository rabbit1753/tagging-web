" i was obliged , " replied the yard - dog . " they turned me out of doors , and chained me up here . i had bitten the youngest of my master 's sons in the leg , because he kicked away the bone i was gnawing . ' bone for bone , ' i thought . but they were so angry , and from that time i have been fastened with a chain , and lost my bone . do n't you hear how hoarse i am . away , away ! i ca n't talk any more like other dogs . away , away , that is the end of it all . " but the snow man was no longer listening . he was looking into the housekeeper 's room on the lower storey . where the stove stood on its four iron legs , looking about the same size as the snow man himself . " what a strange crackling i feel within me , " he said . " shall i ever get in there ? it is an innocent wish , and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled . i must go in there and lean against her , even if i have to break the window . " " you must never go in there , " said the yard - dog , " for if you approach the stove , you 'll melt away , away . " " i might as well go , " said the snow man , " for i think i am breaking up as it is . "
