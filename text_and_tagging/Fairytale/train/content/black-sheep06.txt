" what do those people who have n't any sheep do for clothes ? " asked the lamb . " i 'm sure i do n't know . they must nearly freeze in the winter . perhaps the ram can tell us . " but the ram was still angry , and refused to say anything , so the sheep stopped talking and began to scatter over the pasture and eat the tender , new grass . by and by the black sheep wandered near the lane , and looking up , saw the little boy watching it through the bars . " good morning , black sheep , " said the boy ; " why do you look so funny this morning ? " " they have cut off my wool , " answered the sheep .
