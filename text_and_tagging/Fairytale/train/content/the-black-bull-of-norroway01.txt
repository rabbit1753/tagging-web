in bygone days , long centuries ago , there lived a widowed queen who had three daughters . and this widowed queen was so poor , and had fallen upon such evil days , that she and her daughters had often much ado to get enough to eat . so the eldest princess determined that she would set out into the world to seek her fortune . and her mother was quite willing that she should do so . " for , " said she , " it is better to work abroad than to starve at home . " but as there was an old hen - wife living near the castle who was said to be a witch , and to be able to foretell the future , the queen sent the princess to her cottage , before she set out on her travels , to ask her in which of the four airts she ought to go , in order to find the best fortune . " thou needst gang nae farther than my back door , hinnie , " answered the old dame , who had always felt very sorry for the queen and her pretty daughters , and was glad to do them a good turn .
