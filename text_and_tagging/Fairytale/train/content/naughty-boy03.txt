" poor child ! " said the old poet , as he took the boy by the hand . " come in , come in , and i will soon restore thee ! thou shalt have wine and roasted apples , for thou art verily a charming child ! " and the boy was so really . his eyes were like two bright stars . although the water trickled down his hair , it waved in beautiful curls . he looked exactly like a little angel , but he was so pale , and his whole body trembled with cold . he had a nice little bow in his hand , but it was quite spoiled by the rain , and the tints of his many - colored arrows ran one into the other .
