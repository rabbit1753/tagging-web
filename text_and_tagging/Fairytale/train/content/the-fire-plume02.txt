when they drew up the nets they were rejoiced to see the meshes shining white , all over , with the glittering prey . they landed in fine spirits , and put away their canoe in safety from the winds . " wassamo , " said the cousin , " you cook that we may eat . " wassamo set about the work at once , and soon had his great kettle swung upon its branch , while the cousin lay at his ease upon the other side of the fire . " cousin , " said wassamo , " tell me stories or sing me some love - songs . " the cousin obeyed , and sung his plaintive songs ; or he would frequently break off in the midst of a mournful chant , and begin to recite a mirthful story , and then in the midst of wassamo 's laughter he would return to the plaintive ditty -- just as it suited his fancy ; for the cousin was gay of spirit , and shifted his humor faster than the fleecy clouds that appeared and disappeared in the night - sky over their heads . in this changeful pastime the cousin ran his length , and then he fell away , murmuring parts of his song or story , into a silvery sleep ; with the moon gliding through the branches and gilding his face .
