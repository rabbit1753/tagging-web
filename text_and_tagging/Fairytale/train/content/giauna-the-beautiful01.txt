once upon a time there was a descendant of confucius . his father had a friend , and this friend held an official position in the south and offered the young man a place as secretary . but when the latter reached the town where he was to have been active , he found that his father 's friend had already died . then he was much embarrassed , seeing that he did not have the means to return home again . so he was glad to take refuge in the monastery of puto , where he copied holy books for the abbot .
