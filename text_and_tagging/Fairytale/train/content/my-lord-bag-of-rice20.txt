this time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head , but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before , it struck home to the creature 's brain . then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving , and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day , and then went out in blackness . a great darkness now overspread the heavens , the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed , and the wind roared in fury , and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end . the dragon king and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace , frightened to death , for the building was shaken to its foundation . at last the dreadful night was over . day dawned beautiful and clear . the centipede was gone from the mountain .
