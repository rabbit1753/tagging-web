the wedding was arranged , and the night before the whole town was illuminated . biscuits and gingerbreads were thrown among the people , the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and whistling through their fingers . it was all splendid . ' now i must also give them a treat , ' thought the merchant 's son . and so he bought rockets , crackers , and all the kinds of fireworks you can think of , put them in his trunk , and flew up with them into the air . whirr - r - r , how they fizzed and blazed ! then he went back into the wood to sit in his trunk ; but what had become of it ? the trunk had been burnt . a spark of the fireworks had set it alight , and the trunk was in ashes . he could no longer fly , and could never reach his bride . she stood the whole day long on the roof and waited ; perhaps she is waiting there still . but he wandered through the world and told stories ; though they are not so merry as the one he told about the matches .
