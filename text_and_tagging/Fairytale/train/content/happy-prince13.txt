after they had gone he felt lonely , and began to tire of his lady - love . " she has no conversation , " he said , " and i am afraid that she is a coquette , for she is always flirting with the wind . " and certainly , whenever the wind blew , the reed made the most graceful curtseys . " i admit that she is domestic , " he continued , " but i love travelling , and my wife , consequently , should love travelling also . " " will you come away with me ? " he said finally to her ; but the reed shook her head , she was so attached to her home . " you have been trifling with me , " he cried . " i am off to the pyramids . good - bye ! " and he flew away . all day long he flew , and at night - time he arrived at the city . " where shall i put up ? " he said ; " i hope the town has made preparations . " then he saw the statue on the tall column . " i am waited for in egypt , " said the swallow . " my friends are flying up and down the nile , and talking to the large lotus - flowers . soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great king . the king is there himself in his painted coffin . he is wrapped in yellow linen , and embalmed with spices . round his neck is a chain of pale green jade , and his hands are like withered leaves . " " swallow , swallow , little swallow , " said the prince , " will you not stay with me for one night , and be my messenger ? the boy is so thirsty , and the mother so sad . " " i do n't think i like boys , " answered the swallow . " last summer , when i was staying on the river , there were two rude boys , the miller 's sons , who were always throwing stones at me . they never hit me , of course ; we swallows fly far too well for that , and besides , i come of a family famous for its agility ; but still , it was a mark of disrespect . " but the happy prince looked so sad that the little swallow was sorry . " it is very cold here , " he said ; " but i will stay with you for one night , and be your messenger . "
