" oh , surely , nor are you now . " when i saw i was in a man 's shape i said i would take the child back to his father and mother , as i knew the grief they were in after him . i got a ship , and took the child with me . when i was journeying i came to land on an island , and i saw not a living soul on it , only a court , dark and gloomy . i went in to see was there anyone in it . there was no one but an old hag , tall and frightful , and she asked me , " what sort of person are you ? " i heard someone groaning in another room , and i said i was a doctor , and i asked her what ailed the person who was groaning . " oh , " said she , " it is my son , whose hand has been bitten from his wrist by a dog . " i knew then it was the boy who was taking the child from me , and i said i would cure him if i got a good reward . " i have nothing , but there are eight young lads and three young women , as handsome as anyone laid eyes on , and if you cure him i will give you them . " " but tell me in what place his hand was cut from . " " oh , it was out in another country twelve years ago . " " show me the way , that i may see him . " she brought me into a room , so that i saw him , and his arm was swelled up to the shoulder . he asked if i would cure him . i said i could cure him if he would give me the reward his mother promised . " oh , i will give it , but cure me . " " well , bring them out to me . "
