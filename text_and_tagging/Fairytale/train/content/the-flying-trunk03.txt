at last he had nothing left but four shillings , and he had no clothes except a pair of slippers and an old dressing - gown . his friends did not trouble themselves any more about him ; they would not even walk down the street with him . but one of them who was rather good - natured sent him an old trunk with the message , " pack up ! " that was all very well , but he had nothing to pack up , so he got into the trunk himself . it was an enchanted trunk , for as soon as the lock was pressed it could fly . he pressed it , and away he flew in it up the chimney , high into the clouds , further and further away . but whenever the bottom gave a little creak he was in terror lest the trunk should go to pieces , for then he would have turned a dreadful somersault - just think of it !
