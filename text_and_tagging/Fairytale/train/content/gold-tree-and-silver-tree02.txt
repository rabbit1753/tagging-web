when she found that her step - daughter was so very pretty , she took a dislike to her at once . she was always looking at her and wondering if people would think her prettier than she was . and because , in her heart of hearts , she was afraid that they would do so . she was very unkind indeed to the poor girl . at last , one day , when princess gold - tree was quite grown up , the two ladies went for a walk to a little well . it was all surrounded by trees , in the middle of a deep glen . now the water in this well was so clear that everyone who looked into it saw his face reflected on the surface . the proud queen loved to come and peep into its depths , so that she could see her own picture mirrored in the water .
