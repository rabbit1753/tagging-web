she cleared the three miles of fire at a leap , and asked if he were riding , and he said he was . they went on then , and she told him to dismount and give her a meal . he did so , and gave her a sixpenny loaf and a bottle . she consumed them , and said to him there were before them three miles of hill covered with steel thistles , and that she must clear it . and she cleared the hill with a leap , and she asked him if he were still riding , and he said he was . they went on , and she went not far before she told him to give her a meal , and he gave her the bread and the bottleful . and she went over three miles of sea with a leap , and she came then to the land of the king of france . she went up on a height above the castle , and she shook herself and neighed , and the bells rang . the king said that it was brown allree was in the land . " go out , " said he , " and if it is the son of a king or queen , carry him in on your shoulders ; if it is not , leave him there . " they went out , and the stars of the son of a king were on his breast ; and they lifted him high on their shoulders and bore him in to the king . and they passed the night cheerfully with playing and with drinking , with sport and with diversion , till the whiteness of the day came upon the morrow morning . then the young king told the cause of his journey , and he asked of the queen her counsel and consent , and to give him counsel and good luck , and the woman told him everything she advised him to do . " go now , " said she , " and take with you the best mare in the stable , and go to the door of rough niall of the speckled rock , and knock , and call on him to give you news of the death of anshgayliacht and the sword of light ; and let the horse 's back be to the door , and apply the spurs , and away with you !
