when halvor woke up he saw very well that he had lost the princesses , and began to weep and wail , and was so beside himself with despair that no one could comfort him . and no matter how hard his parents begged him , he would not stay at home , but bade them farewell , and said that he would probably never see them again , for if he did not find his princesses , then it would not be worth his while to go on living . he still had three hundred dollars , and these he put in his pocket and started out . after he had gone a while he met a man with a nice - looking horse . he decided to buy it , and began to talk with the man . " it is true i did not intend to sell the horse , " said the man , " but perhaps we can come to an understanding . " halvor asked him what he wanted for it . " i did not pay much for it , nor is it worth very much : it is a good saddle horse , but as a draft horse it does not amount to much . yet it could carry you and your knapsack without difficulty , if you were to walk a bit from time to time , " said the man . at last they agreed on the price , and halvor slung his knapsack across the horse , and from time to time he walked , and then he rode again .
