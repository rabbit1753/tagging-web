once upon a time there was a king who had several sons . i do not just know how many there were , but the youngest was not content at home . he insisted on going out into the world to seek his fortune . and in the end the king had to give him permission to do so . after he had wandered for a few days , he came to a giant 's castle , and took service with the giant . in the morning the giant wanted to go off to herd his goats , and when he started he told the king 's son he was to clean the stable in the meantime . " and when you are through with that , you need do nothing more for to - day , for you might as well know that you have come to a kind master , " said he . " but you must do what you are told to do conscientiously and , besides , you must not go into any of the rooms that lie behind the one in which you slept last night , else your life will pay the forfeit .
