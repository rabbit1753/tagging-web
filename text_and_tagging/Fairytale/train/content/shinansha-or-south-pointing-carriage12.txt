one day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond . here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought . it was autumn . the trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves , which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond . by and by , kotei 's attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of the water . the little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by . it did so at last , and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond . this little incident made the clever emperor think that he might try to make something that could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over the spider . he set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat . when he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more , and in time there were enough boats for the whole army . kotei now took his army across the river , and attacked shiyu 's headquarters . he gained a complete victory , and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long .
