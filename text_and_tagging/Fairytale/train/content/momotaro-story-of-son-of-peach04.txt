the old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down . then she set to work to wash the clothes ; she took them one by one out of the basket and washed them in the river and rubbed them on the stones . the water was as clear as crystal , and she could see the tiny fish swimming to and fro , and the pebbles at the bottom .
