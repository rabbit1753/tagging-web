' though you compass this there is that which you will not compass . for you must bring me the basket of gwyddneu garanhir which will give meat to the whole world . it is for thy wedding feast . you must also fetch me the drinking - horn that is never empty , and the harp that never ceases to play until it is bidden . also the comb and scissors and razor that lie between the two ears of trwyth the boar , so that i may arrange my hair for the wedding . and though thou get this yet there is that which thou wilt not get , for trwyth the boar will not let any man take from him the comb and the scissors , unless drudwyn the whelp hunt him . but no leash in the world can hold drudwyn save the leash of ca nt ewin , and no collar will hold the leash except the collar of canhastyr .
