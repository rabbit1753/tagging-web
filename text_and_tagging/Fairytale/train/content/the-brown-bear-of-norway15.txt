the servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice of the beautiful young woman at the lodge , and to annoy her with their impudence . the head footman was the most troublesome , and at last she invited him to come and take tea with her . oh , how rejoiced he was , and how he bragged of it in the servants ' hall ! well , the evening came , and the footman walked into the lodge , and was shown to her sitting - room ; for the lodge - keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her , and gave her two nice rooms for herself . well , he sat down as stiff as a ramrod , and was talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle , while she was getting the tea and toast ready . ' oh , ' says she to him , ' would you put your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two of honeysuckle ? ' he got up in great glee , and put out his hand and head ; and said she , ' by the virtue of my magic gifts , let a pair of horns spring out of your head , and sing to the lodge . ' just as she wished , so it was . they sprung from the front of each ear , and met at the back . oh , the poor wretch ! and how he bawled and roared ! and the servants that he used to be boasting to were soon flocking from the castle , and grinning , and huzzaing , and beating tunes on tongs and shovels and pans ; and he cursing and swearing , and the eyes ready to start out of his head , and he so black in the face , and kicking out his legs behind him like mad .
