there was once a peasant who owned a faithful dog called sultan , now grown so old that he had lost all his teeth , and could lay hold of nothing . one day the man was standing at the door of his house with his wife , and he said , " i shall kill old sultan to - morrow ; he is of no good any longer . " his wife felt sorry for the poor dog , and answered , " he has served us for so many years , and has kept with us so faithfully , he deserves food and shelter in his old age . " " dear me , you do not seem to understand the matter , " said the husband ; " he has never a tooth , and no thief would mind him in the least , so i do not see why he should not be made away with . if he has served us well , we have given him plenty of good food .
