there is a lone moor in scotland , which , in times past , was said to be haunted by an elfin knight . this knight was only seen at rare intervals , once in every seven years or so , but the fear of him lay on all the country round , for every now and then someone would set out to cross the moor and would never be heard of again . and although men might search every inch of the ground , no trace of him would be found , and with a thrill of horror the searching party would go home again , shaking their heads and whispering to one another that he had fallen into the hands of the dreaded knight . so , as a rule , the moor was deserted , for nobody dare pass that way , much less live there ; and by and by it became the haunt of all sorts of wild animals , which made their lairs there , as they found that they never were disturbed by mortal huntsmen . now in that same region lived two young earls , earl st . clair and earl gregory , who were such friends that they rode , and hunted , and fought together , if need be .
