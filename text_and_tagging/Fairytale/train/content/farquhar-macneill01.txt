once upon a time there was a young man named farquhar macneill . he had just gone to a new situation . the very first night after he went to it his mistress asked him if he would go over the hill to the house of a neighbour and borrow a sieve . her own was all in holes . she wanted to sift some meal . farquhar agreed to do so . he was a willing lad . he set out at once upon his errand , after the farmer 's wife had pointed out to him the path that he was to follow . she told him that he would have no difficulty in finding the house , even though it was strange to him . he would be sure to see the light in the window . he had not gone very far.however , before he saw what he took to be the light from a cottage window on his left hand , some distance from the path , and , forgetting his mistress 's instructions that he was to follow the path right over the hill . he left it , and walked towards the light .
