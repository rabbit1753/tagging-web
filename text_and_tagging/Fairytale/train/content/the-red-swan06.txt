as he stood musing on this fairy spectacle , a strange noise came to his ear from a distance . at first it seemed like a human voice . after following the sound he reached the shore of a lake . floating at a distance upon its waters sat a most beautiful red swan , whose plumage glittered in the sun , and when it lifted up its neck , it uttered the peculiar tone he had heard . he was within long bow - shot , and , drawing the arrow to his ear , he took a careful aim and discharged the shaft . it took no effect . the beautiful bird sat proudly on the water , still pouring forth its peculiar chant , and still spreading the radiance of its plumage far and wide , and lighting up the whole world , beneath the eye of maidwa , with its ruby splendors . he shot again and again , till his quiver was empty , for he longed to possess so glorious a creature . still the swan did not spread its wings to fly , but , circling round and round , stretched its long neck and dipped its bill into the water , as if indifferent to mortal shafts . maidwa ran home , and bringing all the arrows in the lodge , shot them away . he then stood with his bow dropped at his side , lost in wonder , gazing at the beautiful bird .
