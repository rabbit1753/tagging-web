to this sacred spot leelinau had made her way at an early age , gathering strange flowers and plants , which she would bring home to her parents , and relate to them all the haps and mishaps that had occurred in her rambles . although they discountenanced her frequent visits to the place , they were not able to restrain them , for she was of so gentle and delicate a temper that they feared to thwart her . her attachment to the fairy wood , therefore , grew with her years . if she wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams , or any other maiden favor , leelinau repaired to the manitowok . if her father remained abroad in the hunt later than usual , and it was feared that he had been overwhelmed by the tempest , or had met with some other mischance , leelinau offered up her prayers for safety at the manitowok . it was there that she fasted , mused , and strolled .
