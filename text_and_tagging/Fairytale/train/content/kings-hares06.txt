after he had wandered a while , and began to feel a proper hunger , he came to the old woman who was wedged by the nose in the tree - trunk and who was pulling and jerking away , in order to get loose . " good day , mother , " said esben , " and why are you worrying yourself so with your nose , you poor thing ? " " no one has called me mother for the last hundred years , " said the old woman , " but come and help me out , and give me a bite to eat ; for i have not had a bit to eat in all that time . and i will do something for your sake as well , " said she . yes , no doubt she would need something to eat and drink badly , said esben . then he hewed the tree - trunk apart , so that she got her nose out of the cleft , sat down to eat , and shared with her . the old woman had a good appetite , and she received a good half of his provisions .
