once tsin schi huang was making a progress through the country . when he came to the plain of bo lang , dschang liang armed his people with iron maces in order to kill him . but tsin schi huang always had two traveling coaches which were exactly alike in appearance . in one of them he sat himself , while in the other was seated another person . dschang liang and his followers met the decoy wagon , and dschang liang was forced to flee from the emperor 's rage . he came to a ruined bridge . an icy wind was blowing , and the snowflakes were whirling through the air . there he met an old , old man wearing a black turban and a yellow gown . the old man let one of his shoes fall into the water , looked at dschang liang and said : " fetch it out , little one ! " dschang liang controlled himself , fetched out the shoe and brought it to the old man . the latter stretched out his foot to allow dschang liang to put it on , which he did in a respectful manner . this pleased the old man and he said : " little one , something may be made of you ! come here to - morrow morning early , and i will have something for you . " the following morning at break of dawn , dschang liang appeared . but the old man was already there and reproached him : " you are too late . to - day i will tell you nothing . to - morrow you must come earlier .
