now it happened one day that all the paper in the tub was taken out and laid on the hearth to be burned . people said it could not be sold at the shop , to wrap up butter and sugar , because it had been written upon . the children in the house stood round the hearth to watch the blaze , for paper always flamed up so prettily , and afterwards , among the ashes , there were so many red sparks to be seen running one after the other , here and there , as quick as the wind . they called it seeing the children come out of school , and the last spark , they said , was the schoolmaster . they would often think the last spark had come , and one would cry , " there goes the schoolmaster , " but the next moment another spark would appear , bright and beautiful . how they wanted to know where all the sparks went to ! perhaps they will find out some day .
