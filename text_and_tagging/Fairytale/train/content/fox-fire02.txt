then the farmer realized that it was a fox , who was preparing the elixir of life . he hid in the grass and waited until the ball of fire came down again , at about the height of his own head . then he stepped hastily from his hiding - place , took it away and at once swallowed it . and he could feel it glow as it passed down his throat into his stomach . when the fox saw what had happened he grew angry . he looked furiously at the farmer , but feared his strength . for this reason he did not dare attack him , but went angrily on his way .
