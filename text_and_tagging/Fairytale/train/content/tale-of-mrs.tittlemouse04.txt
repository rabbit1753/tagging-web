" how do you do , mr . jackson ? deary me , you have got very wet ! " " thank you , thank you , thank you , mrs . tittlemouse ! i 'll sit awhile and dry myself , " said mr . jackson . he sat and smiled , and the water dripped off his coat tails . mrs . tittlemouse went round with a mop . he sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner ? first she offered him cherry - stones . " thank you , thank you , mrs . tittlemouse ! no teeth , no teeth , no teeth ! " said mr . jackson . he opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide ; he certainly had not a tooth in his head .
