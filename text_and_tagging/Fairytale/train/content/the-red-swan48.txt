maidwa thought it strange that he should be so warmly received , and married instantly against his own wishes , although he could not help noticing that the chief 's daughter was pretty . it was some time before she would take the moccasins which he had laid off . it displeased him to see her reluctant to do so . when at last she did reach them , he snatched them from her hand and hung them up himself . he lay down and thought of the swan , and made up his mind to be off with the dawn . he wakened early , and finding the chief 's daughter looking forth at the door , he spoke to her , but she gave no answer . he touched her lightly . " what do you want ? " she said , and turned her face away from him . " tell me , " said maidwa , " what time the swan passed . i am following it ; come out , and point the way . " " do you think you can overtake it ? " she said . " yes , " he answered . " naubesah -- fool ! " retorted the chief 's pretty daughter . she , however , went out , and pointed in the direction he should go . the young man paced slowly along till the sun arose , when he commenced traveling at his accustomed speed . he passed the day in running , and although he could not see anywhere on the horizon the red swan , he thought that he discerned a faint red light far over in the west .
