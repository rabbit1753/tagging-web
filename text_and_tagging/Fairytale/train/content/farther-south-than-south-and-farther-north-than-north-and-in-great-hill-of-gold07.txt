the young fellow said it was not worth quarreling about such things , and that he had better shoes and better canes at home . " you can not say that , " returned the brothers , " for whoever has these shoes on can cover a thousand miles in a single step , and whatever is touched with this cane must die at once . " the young fellow went on to ask whether they would sell the things . they said that they ought to get a great deal for them . " but what you say of them is not true at all , " the young fellow replied . " yes , indeed , it is absolutely true , " they answered . " just let me see whether the boots will fit me , " said the young fellow . so they let him try them on . but no sooner did the young fellow have the boots on his feet , and the cane in his hand , than he took a step and off he was , a thousand miles away .
