that night the men slept in the house of custennin the herdsman , and the next day they proceeded to the castle , and entered the hall , and said : ' yspaddaden penkawr , give us thy daughter and thou shalt keep her dower . and unless thou wilt do this we will slay thee . ' ' her four great grandmothers and her four great grandfathers yet live , ' answered yspaddaden penkawr ; ' it is needful that i take counsel with them . ' ' be it so ; we will go to meat , ' but as they turned he took up the second dart that lay by his side and cast it after them . and menw caught it , and flung it at him , and wounded him in the chest , so that it came out at his back . ' a gentle son - in - law , truly ! ' cried yspaddaden , ' the iron pains me like the bite of a horse - leech . cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated , and the smith who formed it ! ' the third day arthur 's men returned to the palace into the presence of yspaddaden .
