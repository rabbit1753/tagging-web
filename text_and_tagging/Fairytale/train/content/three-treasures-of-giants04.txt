no sooner was the old man buried than martin and michael agreed that they would go into the world together to seek their fortunes , while jack stayed at home with their mother . jack would have liked nothing better than to sit and dream by the fire , but the mother , who was very old herself , declared that there was no work for him to do , and that he must seek it with his brothers . so , one fine morning , all three set out ; martin and michael carried two great bags full of food , but jack carried nothing . this made his brothers very angry , for the day was hot and the bags were heavy , and about noon they sat down under a tree and began to eat . jack was as hungry as they were , but he knew that it was no use asking for anything ; and he threw himself under another tree , and wept bitterly .
