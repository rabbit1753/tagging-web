as a punishment for having once upon a time used that foot against a venerable medicine man , aggo dah gauda had one leg looped up to his thigh , so that he was obliged to get along by hopping . by dint of practice he had become very skillful in this exercise , and he could make leaps which seemed almost incredible . aggo had a beautiful daughter , and his chief care was to secure her from being carried off by the king of the buffalos , who was the ruler of all the herds of that kind , and had them entirely at his command to make them do as he willed . dah gauda , too , was quite an important person in his own way , for he lived in great state , having a log house of his own , and a court - yard which extended from the sill of his front - door as many hundred miles westward as he chose to measure it . although he might claim this extensive privilege of ground , he advised his daughter to keep within doors , and by no means to go far in the neighborhood , as she would otherwise be sure to be stolen away , as he was satisfied that the buffalo - king spent night and day lurking about and lying in wait to seize her .
