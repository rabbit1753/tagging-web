on the following day the second princess was to be carried off . so sheep - peter went to queen crane , who gave him a steed , a suit of armor and a sword , and with them he rode to the castle , and fetched the second princess . when they reached the sea - shore the meer - woman had not yet appeared . so the youth lay down to sleep and said to the princess : " wake me when the meer - woman comes , and if you can not wake me , then tell my horse . " with that he fell asleep , and meanwhile the princess wove a string of pearls into his hair . when the meer - woman came , the princess tried to wake him ; but he would not wake up at all , and so she told the horse to waken him . and the horse did wake him . the great lords , however , who were standing about , climbed into the trees out of pure fright when the meer - woman appeared . the youth took the princess on his steed , cried : " god aid me , and queen crane stay by me , and i will succeed ! " and with that he slew the meer - woman . then he rode quickly back to queen crane , took off his armor , and led his flock out to pasture . but among the on - lookers had been a count , who threatened the princess , and said he would thrust her through with his sword if she did not swear he had rescued her . the princess did so out of fear ; but from sheep - peter no one heard a word .
