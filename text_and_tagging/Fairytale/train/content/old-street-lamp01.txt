did you ever hear the story of the old street lamp ? it is not remarkably interesting , but for once you may as well listen to it . it was a most respectable old lamp , which had seen many , many years of service and now was to retire with a pension . it was this very evening at its post for the last time , giving light to the street . its feelings were something like those of an old dancer at the theater who is dancing for the last time and knows that on the morrow she will be in her garret , alone and forgotten .
