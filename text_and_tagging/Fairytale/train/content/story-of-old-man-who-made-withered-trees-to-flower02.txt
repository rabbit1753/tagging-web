the happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from his work in the field . having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables , he would take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage . sure enough , shiro was waiting for his master and the evening tit - bit . then the old man said " chin , chin ! " and shiro sat up and begged , and his master gave him the food . next door to this good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel . they hated their good neighbors and the dog shiro with all their might . whenever shiro happened to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him , sometimes even wounding him .
