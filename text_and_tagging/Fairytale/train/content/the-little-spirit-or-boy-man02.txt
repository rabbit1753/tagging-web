when he came up to the shore he was surprised to see four large , tall men , lying on the ice , spearing fish . they were four brothers , who looked exactly alike . as the little boy - man approached them , the nearest looked up . in his turn he was surprised to see such a tiny being . turning to his brothers , he said : " tia ! look ! see what a little fellow is here . " the three others then looked up too . seeing these four faces , as if they had been one , the little spirit or boy - man said to himself : " four in one ! what a time they must have in choosing their hunting - shirts ! " after they had all stared for a moment at the boy , they covered their heads , intent in searching for fish . the boy thought to himself : " these four - faces fancy that i am to be put off without notice because i am so little . they are so broad and long . they shall find out . i may find a way to teach them that i am not to be treated so lightly .
