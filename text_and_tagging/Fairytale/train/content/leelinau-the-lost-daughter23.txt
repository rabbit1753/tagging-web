it had been her custom to pass many of her hours in her favorite place of retirement , under a broad - topped young pine , whose leaves whispered in every wind that blew ; but most of all in that gentle murmur of the air at the evening hour , dear to lovers , when the twilight steals on . thither she now repaired , and , while reclining pensively against the young pine - tree , she fancied that she heard a voice addressing her . at first it was scarcely more than a sigh ; presently it grew more clear , and she heard it distinctly whisper-- " maiden ! think me not a tree ; but thine own dear lover ; fond to be with thee in my tall and blooming strength , with the bright green nodding plume that waves above thee . thou art leaning on my breast , leelinau ; lean forever there and be at peace . fly from men who are false and cruel , and quit the tumult of their dusty strife , for this quiet , lonely shade .
