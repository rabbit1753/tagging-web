the boar was pleased at the flattery and determined to help the monkey . he thought for a little while and then said : " has n't your master a baby ? " " oh , yes , " said the monkey , " he has one infant son . " " does n't it lie by the door in the morning when your mistress begins the work of the day ? well , i will come round early and when i see my opportunity i will seize the child and run off with it . " " what then ? " said the monkey . " why the mother will be in a tremendous scare , and before your master and mistress know what to do , you must run after me and rescue the child and take it home safely to its parents , and you will see that when the butcher comes they wo n't have the heart to sell you . "
