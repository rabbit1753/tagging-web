" faith , " said finn , " beautiful ; and how are you , oonagh -- and how did you sport your figure during my absence , my bilberry ? " " never a merrier -- as bouncing a grass widow as ever there was in sweet ' tyrone among the bushes . ' " finn gave a short , good - humoured cough . he laughed most heartily to show her how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his absence . " an ' what brought you home so soon , finn ? " said she . " why , avourneen , " said finn , putting in his answer in the proper way , " never the thing but the purest of love and affection for yourself . sure , you know that 's truth , anyhow , oonagh . " finn spent two or three happy days with oonagh , and felt himself very comfortable considering the dread he had of far rua . this , however , grew upon him so much that his wife could not but perceive something lay on his mind which he kept altogether to himself . let a woman alone in the meantime for ferreting or wheedling a secret out of her good man when she wishes . finn was a proof of this . " it 's this far rua , " said he , " that 's troublin ' me . when the fellow gets angry and begins to stamp he 'll shake you a whole townland . it 's well known that he can stop a thunderbolt , for he always carries one about with him in the shape of a pancake to show to anyone that might misdoubt it . " as he spoke he clapped his thumb in his mouth , as he always did when he wanted to prophesy or to know anything . " he 's coming , " said finn . " i see him below at dungannon . " " an ' who is it , avick ? " " far rua , " replied finn , " and how to manage i do n't know . if i run away i am disgraced , and i know that sooner or later i must meet him , for my thumb tells me so . "
