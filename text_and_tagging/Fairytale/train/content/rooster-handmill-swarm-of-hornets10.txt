once upon a time there was a peasant who wanted to go to sell a pig . after he had gone a while , he met a man who asked him where he was going with his pig . " i want to sell it , " answered the peasant , " but i do not know what to do to get rid of it . " " go to the devil , " said the man , " he will be the first to rid you of it . " so the peasant kept on along the broad highway . when he came to the devil 's place , there stood a man out by the wood - pile making wood . the peasant went to him and asked whether he could tell him if they wanted to buy a pig in the devil 's place . " i 'll go in and ask , " said the man , " if you will make wood in my stead while i am gone . " " yes , i will do that gladly , " said the peasant , took the ax , stood at the wood - pile and began to make wood . and he worked and worked until evening came ; but the man did not return to tell him whether they would or would not buy a pig in the devil 's place . at length another man came that way , and the peasant asked him whether he would make wood in his stead , for it was impossible to lay down the ax unless another took it up and went on working . so the man took the ax and stood there making wood , and the peasant went into the devil 's place himself , and asked whether any one wanted to buy a pig .
