" indeed ! how interesting ! i wish i could meet with that fowl . i would teach it to mind its own business ! " " but as to a nest -- there is no difficulty : i have a sackful of feathers in my wood - shed . no , my dear madam , you will be in nobody 's way . you may sit there as long as you like , " said the bushy long - tailed gentleman . he led the way to a very retired , dismal - looking house amongst the fox - gloves . it was built of faggots and turf , and there were two broken pails , one on top of another , by way of a chimney . " this is my summer residence ; you would not find my earth -- my winter house -- so convenient , " said the hospitable gentleman . there was a tumble - down shed at the back of the house , made of old soap - boxes . the gentleman opened the door , and showed jemima in . the shed was almost quite full of feathers -- it was almost suffocating ; but it was comfortable and very soft . jemima puddle - duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers . but it was very comfortable ; and she made a nest without any trouble at all .
