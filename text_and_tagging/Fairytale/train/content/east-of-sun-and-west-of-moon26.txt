" alas , what have you done ! " cried he . " now you have made both of us unhappy . if you had only held out until the end of the year , i would have been delivered . i have a step - mother who has cast a spell on me , so that by day i am a bear , and at night a human being . but now all is over between us , and i must return to my step - mother . she lives in a castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon , where there is a princess with a nose three yards long , whom i must now marry . " the maiden wept and wailed to no avail , for the prince said he must journey away . then she asked him whether she might not go with him . no , said he , that could not be . " but can you not at least tell me the road , so that i can search for you . for surely that will be permitted me ? " " yes , that you may do , " said he . " but there is no road that leads there . the castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon , and neither now nor at any other time will you find the road to it ! " " o , yes , i know very well where the castle lies , " said the north wind . " i blew an aspen leaf there just once , and then i was so weary that i could not blow at all for many a long day . but if you want to get there above all things , and are not afraid of me , i will take you on my back , and see whether i can blow you there . " the maiden said that she must and would get to the castle , if it were by any means possible . she was not afraid , no matter how hard the journey might be . " very well , then you must stay here over night , " said the north wind . " for if we are to get there to - morrow , we must have the whole day before us . "
