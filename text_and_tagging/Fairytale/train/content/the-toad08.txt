eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well , and experienced no want of provisions . on the ninth day she thought , " forward ! onward ! " but what could she find more charming and beautiful ? perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs . during the last night there had been a sound borne on the breeze , as if there were cousins in the neighborhood . " it 's a glorious thing to live ! glorious to get out of the well , and to lie among the stinging - nettles , and to crawl along the dusty road . but onward , onward ! that we may find frogs or a little toad . we ca n't do without that . nature alone is not enough for one . " and so she went forward on her journey . she came out into the open field , to a great pond , round about which grew reeds . she walked into it . " it will be too damp for you here , " said the frogs ; " but you are very welcome ! are you a he or a she ? but it does n't matter ; you are equally welcome . "
