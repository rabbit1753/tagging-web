the old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence . she was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the prince . the maiden could not rest for thinking of this . at last she could bear it no longer , and resolved to seek help from the prince . by great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard 's son in the palace garden , who understood the speech of birds , and to him he had entrusted the message . when the prince heard it , he was very sorrowful , and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden . then he said to the wind wizard 's son : " beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night , for then will i come and fetch her away . " the wind wizard 's son did this , and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening . the maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home , telling no one what she had heard .
