" may god aid us ! " cried the man . " we can not shelter you , and have to leave the house ourselves , because the place is alive with trolls every christmas eve ! " but per gynt thought he could manage to clear the house of the trolls . so they told him to stay , and gave him a pig 's skin into the bargain . then the bear lay down behind the hearth , per took out his awl , his pitch and his wire , and set out to make a single large shoe out of the pig 's skin . and he drew a thick rope through it for a lace , so that he could lace the whole shoe together , and besides he had two wagon - spokes for wedges at hand . suddenly the trolls came along with fiddles and fiddlers , and some of them danced , and others ate of the christmas dinner that stood on the table , and some fried bacon , and others fried frogs and toads and disgusting things of that kind -- the christmas dinner they had brought along themselves . in the meantime some of them noticed the shoe per gynt had made . since it was evidently intended for a large foot , all the trolls wanted to try it on . when every one of them had thrust in his foot , per gynt laced it , forced in a wedge , and then drew the lace so taut that every last one of them was caught and held in the shoe . but now the bear thrust forth his nose , and sniffed the roast .
