watanabe , the second knight , could not bear the thought that his companion should believe he was afraid , so he answered quickly : " of course , i will go at once and find out for myself ! " so watanabe at once got ready to go - he buckled on his long sword and put on a coat of armor , and tied on his large helmet . when he was ready to start he said to the others : " give me something so that i can prove i have been there ! " then one of the men got a roll of writing paper and his box of indian ink and brushes , and the four comrades wrote their names on a piece of paper . " i will take this , " said watanabe , " and put it on the gate of rashomon , so to - morrow morning will you all go and look at it ? i may be able to catch an ogre or two by then ! " and he mounted his horse and rode off gallantly .
