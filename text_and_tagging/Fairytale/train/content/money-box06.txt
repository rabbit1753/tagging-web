it was not worth much , but it was very well played , and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience , for they were made only to be seen on one side . the acting was wonderful , excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps , because the wires were a little too long . the doll , whose neck had been darned , was so excited that the place in her neck burst , and the money - pig declared he must do something for one of the players , as they had all pleased him so much . so he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will , as the one to be buried with him in the family vault , whenever that event should happen . they all enjoyed the comedy so much , that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party , and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement , which they called playing at men and women ; and there was nothing wrong about it , for it was only play .
