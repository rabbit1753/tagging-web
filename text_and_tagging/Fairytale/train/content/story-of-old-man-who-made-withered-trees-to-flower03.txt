one day shiro was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master 's house . the old man , thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn , hurried out to see what was the matter . as soon as shiro saw his master he ran to meet him , wagging his tail . seizing the end of his kimono , he dragged him under a large yenoki tree . here he began to dig very industriously with his paws , yelping with joy all the time . the old man , unable to understand what it all meant , stood looking on in bewilderment . but shiro went on barking and digging with all his might .
