" enquired the lady . " very badly , ma'am , " was the reply . " badly ! what do you mean ? is she ill ? " " she 's far from well , ma'am , " answered the nurse , " and seems to be getting worse every day . " " well , " replied the lady ; " you must have the doctor to see her ; and do n't forget to let me know what he says . that is all , nurse . " she turned to her novel again , and the nurse walked away and sent a servant for the doctor . that great man , when he came , shook his head solemnly and said , " she must have a change . take her away into the country as soon as possible . " " and very good advice it was , too , " remarked the nurse to one of the maids ; " for i feel as if i needed a change myself . " when she reported the matter to mrs . muffet the mother answered , " very well ; i will see mr . muffet and have him write out a cheque . "
