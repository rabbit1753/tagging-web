" do not grieve for thy dog , o culain , " said setanta , from the shoulder of fergus , " for i will perform those services for you myself until a dog equally good is procured to take the place of him i slew . " then one jesting , said , " cu - culain ! " ( hound of culain ) and thenceforward he went by this name .
