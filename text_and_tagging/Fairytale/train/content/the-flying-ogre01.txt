there once lived in sianfu an old buddhist monk , who loved to wander in lonely places . in the course of his wanderings he once came to the kuku - nor , and there he saw a tree which was a thousand feet high and many cords in breadth . it was hollow inside and one could see the sky shining down into it from above .
