once upon a time there lived a king and queen , who were the best creatures in the world , and so kind - hearted that they could not bear to see their subjects want for anything . the consequence was that they gradually gave away all their treasures , till they positively had nothing left to live upon ; and this coming to the ears of their neighbour , king bruin , he promptly raised a large army and marched into their country . the poor king , having no means of defending his kingdom , was forced to disguise himself with a false beard , and carrying his only son , the little prince featherhead , in his arms , and accompanied only by the queen , to make the best of his way into the wild country . they were lucky enough to escape the soldiers of king bruin , and at last , after unheard - of fatigues and adventures , they found themselves in a charming green valley , through which flowed a stream clear as crystal and overshadowed by beautiful trees .
