" i felt quite light , my cheerfulness had returned , and i was the happiest of mortals . the polytechnic professor had fully cured me . i was as happy as a king , and went to sleep on the box . next morning -- correctly speaking , it was noon , for i slept remarkably late that day -- i found myself still sitting there , in happy consciousness that my former wish had been a foolish one . i inquired for the polytechnic professor . but he had disappeared like the greek and roman gods . from that time i have been the happiest man in the world . i am a happy director ; for none of my company ever grumble , nor the public either , for i always make them merry . i can arrange my pieces just as i please . i choose out of every comedy what i like best , and no one is offended .
