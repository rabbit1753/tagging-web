they had n't been long at work when a tailor came in , and he sat down and began to talk . you all heard how the two princess were loth to be married till the youngest would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart . but after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her bridegroom that was to be , there was no more sign of a well , or a rope , or a windlass , than there is on the palm of your hand . so the princes that were courting the eldest ladies would n't give peace or ease to their lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage , and it was to take place this morning . myself went down out of curiousity , and to be sure i was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides , and the three crowns on their heads -- gold , silver , and copper , one inside the other . the youngest was standing by mournful enough , and all was ready . the two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please , and up they were walking to the altar rails , when the boards opened two yards wide under their feet , and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in the vaults . oh , such shrieks as the ladies gave ! and such running and racing and peeping down as there was ! but the clerk soon opened the door of the vault , and up came the two princes , their fine clothes covered an inch thick with cobwebs and mould .
