he left his boy to take care of the lodge while he was absent , hunting and roaming about from place to place , striving to forget his misfortune , and searching for the wicked weendigo . he had been gone but a little while one morning , when his son shot his arrows out through the top of the lodge , and running out to look for them , he could find them nowhere . the boy had been trying his luck , and he was puzzled that he had shot his shafts entirely out of sight . his father made him more arrows , and when he was again left alone , he shot one of them out ; but although he looked as sharply as he could toward the spot where it fell , and ran thither at once , he could not find it . he shot another , which was lost in the same way ; and returning to the lodge to replenish his quiver , he happened to espy one of the lucky arrows , which the first weendigo had given to his father , hanging upon the side of the lodge . he reached up , and having secured it , he shot it out at the opening , and immediately running out to find where it fell , he was surprised to see a beautiful boy just in the act of taking it up , and hurrying away with it to a large tree , where he disappeared .
