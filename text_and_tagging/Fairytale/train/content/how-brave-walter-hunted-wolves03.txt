indeed , some thought that the brave boy boasted a little . one must indeed believe him since he said so himself . so jonas and lena used to say of him ' look , there goes walter , who shoots the wolves . ' and other boys and girls would say ' look , there goes brave walter , who is brave enough to fight with four . ' there was no one so fully convinced of this as walter himself , and one day he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt . he took with him his drum , which had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to reach a cluster of rowan berries , and his tin sabre , which was a little broken , because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes . he did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop - gun , his bow , and his air - pistol . he had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his moustache , and a red cock 's feather to put in his cap to make himself look fierce . he had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp knife with a bone handle , to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them . he thought it would be cruel to do that while they were still living .
