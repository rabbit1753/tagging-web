jose did exactly as the horse told him , and everything fell out as the animal prophesied ; so that it was not until they were galloping breathlessly towards the palace that the princess knew that she was taken captive . she said nothing , however , but quietly opened her apron which contained the bran for the chickens , and in a moment it lay scattered on the ground . ' oh , i have let fall my bran ! ' cried she ; ' please get down and pick it up for me . ' but jose only answered : ' we shall find plenty of bran where we are going . ' and the horse galloped on . they were now passing through a forest , and the princess took out her handkerchief and threw it upwards , so that it stuck in one of the topmost branches of a tree . ' dear me ; how stupid ! i have let my handkerchief blow away , ' said she . ' will you climb up and get it for me ? ' but jose answered : ' we shall find plenty of handkerchiefs where we are going . ' and the horse galloped on . after the wood they reached a river , and the princess slipped a ring off her finger and let it roll into the water . ' how careless of me , ' gasped she , beginning to sob . ' i have lost my favourite ring ; do stop for a moment and look if you can see it . ' but jose answered : ' you will find plenty of rings where you are going . ' and the horse galloped on .
