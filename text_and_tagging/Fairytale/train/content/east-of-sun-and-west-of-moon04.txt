the man was not ill - pleased that he was to become so rich . he did think that first he ought to speak to his daughter about it . so he went in again , and said that there was a white bear outside , who had promised to make him just as rich as he was poor now , if he could only have the youngest daughter for his bride . but the girl said no , and would not hear of it . then the man went back to the bear again , and they both agreed that the white bear should return again the following thursday and get his answer . in the meantime , however , the parents worked upon their daughter . they talked at length about all the riches they would gain , and how well she herself would fare . so at last she agreed , washed and mended the few poor clothes she had , adorned herself as well as she could , and made ready to travel . and what she was given to take along with her is not worth mentioning , either .
