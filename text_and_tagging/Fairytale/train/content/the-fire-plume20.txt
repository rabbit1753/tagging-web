the rest of the old spirit seemed to have done him much good , for he was very cheerful ; and , first putting his head forth from the window for a puff at a sand - hill , which was his prime luxury in a morning , he said to wassamo , " son - in - law , you have been very patient with our long absence from your company , and you shall be rewarded . in a few days you may start with your wife to visit your relations . you can be absent one year , but at the end of that time you must return . when you get to your home - village , you must first go in alone . leave your wife at a short distance from the lodge , and when you are welcome , then send for her . when there , do not be surprised that she disappears whenever you hear it thunder . " he added , with a sly look , " that old island spirit has a brother down in that part of the country . you will prosper in all things , for my daughter is very diligent . all the time that you pass in sleep , she will be at work . the distance is short to your village . a path leads directly to it , and when you get there , do not forget my wants as i stated to you before .
