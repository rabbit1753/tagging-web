they made three parts of that night . the first part they spent in conversation , the second in telling tales , the third in eating and drinking , with sound sleep and sweet slumber . as early as the day dawned next morning the old woman was up , and had food for the young men . when the three had eaten , she spoke to ur , and this is what she asked of him : " what was it that drove you from home , and what brought you to this place ? " " a champion met my father , and took three teeth from him and put his head in the dirt . i am looking for that man , to find him alive or dead . " " that was the green knight from terrible valley . he is the man who took the three teeth from your father . i am three hundred years living in this place , and there is not a year of the three hundred in which three hundred heroes , fresh , young , and noble , have not passed on the way to terrible valley , and never have i seen one coming back , and each of them had the look of a man better than you . and now where are you going , arthur ? " " i am on the same journey with my brother . " " where are you going , lawn dyarrig ? " " i am going with these as a servant , " said lawn dyarrig .
