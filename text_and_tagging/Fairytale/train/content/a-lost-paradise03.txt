the charcoal - burner and his wife both stared at him for a moment , as if they could hardly believe their ears . indeed , it was not to be wondered at ! then they found their tongues , and exclaimed together : ' oh , yes , yes , my lord ! we will do everything you tell us . how could we be so ungrateful as to disobey you , when you are so kind ? ' the king smiled , and his eyes twinkled . ' well , let us start at once , ' said he . ' lock your door , and put the key in your pocket . ' the woman looked as if she thought this was needless , seeing it was quite , quite certain they would never come back . but she dared not say so , and did as the king told her . after walking through the forest for a couple of miles , they all three reached the palace . by the king 's orders , servants led the charcoal - burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things such as they had never even dreamed of . first , they bathed in green marble baths where the water looked like the sea . then , they put on silken clothes that felt soft and pleasant . when they were ready , one of the king 's special servants entered , and took them into a small hall , where dinner was laid . this pleased them better than anything else .
