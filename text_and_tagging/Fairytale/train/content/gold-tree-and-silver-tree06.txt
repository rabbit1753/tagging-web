it was no wonder that he did so . the queen 's expression was not pleasant to look at , as she darted an angry glance at her fair young step - daughter . she was busy picking flowers some little distance away . indeed , she was so annoyed at the thought that anyone should say that the girl was prettier than she was . she quite lost her self - control . when she reached home she went up , in a violent passion , to her room , and threw herself on the bed , declaring that she felt very ill indeed . it was in vain that princess gold - tree asked her what the matter was , and if she could do anything for her . she would not let the poor girl touch her , but pushed her away as if she had been some evil thing . so at last the princess had to leave her alone , and go out of the apartment , feeling very sad indeed .
