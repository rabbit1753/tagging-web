the prince was going down a gravel walk with a quickset hedge on each side , and his eyes on the ground , and he was thinking of one thing and another . at last he lifted his eyes , and there he was outside of a smith 's gate that he often passed before , about a mile away from the palace of his betrothed princess . the clothes he had on him were as ragged as you please , but he had his crowns safe under his old cloak . then the smith came out , and says he , ' it 's a shame for a strong , big fellow like you to be lazy , and so much work to be done . are you any good with hammer and tongs ? come in and bear a hand , an i 'll give you diet and lodging , and a few pence when you earn them . ' ' never say't twice , ' says the prince . ' i want nothing but to be busy . ' so he took the hammer , and pounded away at the red - hot bar that the smith was turning on the anvil to make into a set of horse - shoes .
