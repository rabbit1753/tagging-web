mrs . tittlemouse began to pull out the moss . three or four other bees put their heads out , and buzzed fiercely . " i am not in the habit of letting lodgings ; this is an intrusion ! " said mrs . tittlemouse . " i will have them turned out-- " " buzz ! buzz ! buzzz!"--"i wonder who would help me ? " " bizz , wizz , wizzz ! " --"i will not have mr . jackson ; he never wipes his feet . " mrs . tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner . when she got back to the parlour , she heard some one coughing in a fat voice ; and there sat mr . jackson himself ! he was sitting all over a small rocking - chair , twiddling his thumbs and smiling , with his feet on the fender . he lived in a drain below the hedge , in a very dirty wet ditch .
