now his people said to him : " you should keep the wild man a captive here at your court , in order that the whole country may talk of what a mighty huntsman you are . only you should guard him so that he does not escape ; because he is of a sly and treacherous disposition . " when the king had listened to them he said nothing for a long time . then he replied : " i will do as you say , and if the wild man escape , it shall be no fault of mine . but i vow that whoever lets him go shall die without mercy , and though he were my own son ! "
