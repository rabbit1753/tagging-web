when he stood before the door at home , he turned around ; and there lay many , many hundred yards of the finest linen , finer than the most skillful weaver could have spun . " mother , come out , come out ! " called and cried the youth . his mother came darting out , and asked what was the matter . and when she saw the linen , stretching as far as she could see , and then a bit , she could not believe her eyes , until the youth told her how it all happened . but when she had heard that , and had tested the linen between her fingers , she was so pleased that she , too , began to sing and dance . then she took the linen , cut it , and sewed shirts from it for her son and herself . the remainder she took to town and sold for a good price . then for a time they lived in all joy and comfort . but when that was over the woman had not a bite to eat in the house . she told her son that it was the highest time for him to take service , and really do something , or else both of them would have to starve to death . " thank heaven , i have escaped ! " said the youth to himself . " i am sure i 'll never go there again , " and then he sang and danced again as usual . he thought no more of the rat - hole , but fell to humming , and sang without stopping : " short before and long behind ! short before and long behind ! " when he stood at the door of the house , he happened to look around . there lay the finest woolen goods , many hundred yards of it , stretching for half a mile , and so fine that no city counselor wore a coat of finer cloth .
