and so it was that a week later little miss muffet went to the country , or rather to a small town where there was a summer hotel that had been highly recommended to nurse holloweg ; and with her went the string of maids and a wagon - load of boxes and trunks . the morning after their arrival the little girl asked to go out upon the lawn . " well , " replied nurse holloweg , " sarah can take you out for half an hour . but remember you are not to run and get heated , for that will ruin your complexion ; and you must not speak to any of the common children you meet , for your mother would object ; and you must not get your shoes dusty nor your dress soiled , nor disobey sarah in any way .
