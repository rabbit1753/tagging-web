" no , " said the youth , he always had something to think about . the man asked whether he did not need a servant . " no , " said the youth , " i am used to serving myself , so i have no need of a servant . no matter how much i might wish for one , i still would have to do without , since i have no money for his keep and pay . " " yet you need a servant , as i know better than you do , " said the man , " and you need one upon whom you can rely in life and death . but if you do not want me for a servant , then let me be your comrade . i promise that you will not lose thereby , and i will not cost you a shilling . i travel at my own expense , nor need you be put to trouble as regards my food and clothing .
