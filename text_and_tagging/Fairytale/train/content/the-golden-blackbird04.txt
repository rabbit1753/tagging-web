as he went his way he met a little hare , who stopped to look at him , and asked : ' where are you going , my friend ? ' ' i really do n't quite know , ' answered he . ' my father is ill , and he can not be cured unless i bring him back the golden blackbird . it is a long time since i set out , but no one can tell me where to find it . ' ' ah , ' said the hare , ' you have a long way to go yet . you will have to walk at least seven hundred miles before you get to it . ' ' and how am i to travel such a distance ? ' ' mount on my back , ' said the little hare , ' and i will conduct you . '
