and death stretched out his long hand towards the fine little flower , but she held her hands fast around his , so tight , and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves . then death blew on her hands , and she felt that it was colder than the cold wind , and her hands fell down powerless . " thou canst not do anything against me ! " said death . " but our lord can ! " said she . " i only do his bidding ! " said death . " i am his gardener , i take all his flowers and trees , and plant them out in the great garden of paradise , in the unknown land ; but how they grow there , and how it is there i dare not tell thee . " " give me back my child ! " said the mother , and she wept and prayed . at once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by , with each hand , and cried out to death , " i will tear all thy flowers off , for i am in despair . " " touch them not ! " said death . " thou say'st that thou art so unhappy , and now thou wilt make another mother equally unhappy . "
