" now , give me absolution , for my time is come , " said he . and they gave him absolution as speedily as might be . then , close outside the window , the sweetest song they heard . that ever yet since the world began was uttered by any bird . the monks looked out and saw the bird . its feathers all white and clean . and there in a moment , beside it , another white bird was seen . those two they sang together , waved their white wings , and fled , flew aloft , and vanished . but the good old man was dead . they buried his blessed body where lake and greensward meet . a carven cross above his head , a holly - bush at his feet . where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies , the purple peaks of killarney from ancient woods arise .
