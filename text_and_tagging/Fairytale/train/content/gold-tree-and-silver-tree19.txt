now the servants worshipped the ground that their young mistress trod on . she was always kind and considerate to them . when they saw how frightened she was , and heard her piteous words , they crowded round her , as if to shield her from any harm that threatened her . " do not be afraid , your highness , " they cried ; " we will defend thee with our very lives if need be . but in case thy lady step - mother should have the power to throw any evil spell over thee , we will lock you in the great mullioned chamber . then she can not get nigh thee at all . " now the mullioned chamber was a strong - room , which was in a part of the castle all by itself . its door was so thick that no one could possibly break through it . the princess knew that if she were once inside the room , with its stout oaken door between her and her step - mother , she would be perfectly safe from any mischief that that wicked woman could devise .
