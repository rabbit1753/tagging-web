' and if we , who live close by the forest , do not know , you may be sure no one does , ' added the eldest , who was rather cross at finding this was all that the king wanted of them . ' but the boy told me there were seven of you , and there are only six here , ' said the king . ' oh , the youngest is at home , but she is always half asleep , and is of no use except to cut wood for the fire , ' replied they in a breath . ' that may be , but perhaps she dreams , ' answered the king . ' anyway , i will speak to her also . ' then he signed to one of his attendants , who followed the path that the boy had taken to the hut . soon the man returned , with the girl walking behind him . and as soon as she reached the tree it bowed itself to the earth before her , and she stretched out her hand and picked some of its leaves and flowers and gave them to the king . ' the maiden who can work such wonders is fitted to be the wife of the greatest chief , ' he said . he married her , and took her with him across the sea to his own home , where they lived happily for ever after .
