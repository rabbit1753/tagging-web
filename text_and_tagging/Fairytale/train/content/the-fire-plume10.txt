wassamo felt himself moved , he knew not how , and placed upon a couch . some time after , the spell seemed to be a little lightened , and on opening his eyes , he was surprised to find that he was lying in a spacious and shining lodge , extending as far as the eye could reach . one spoke to him and said : " stranger , awake , and take something wherewith to refresh yourself . " he obeyed the command and sat up . on either side of the lodge he beheld rows of people seated in orderly array . at a distance he could see two stately persons , who looked rather more in years than the others , and who appeared to exact obedience from all around them . one of them , whom he heard addressed as the old spirit - man , spoke to wassamo . " my son , " said he , " know it was those foolish girls who brought you hither . they saw you at the fishing - ground . when you attempted to approach them you fell senseless , and at the same moment they transported you to this place . we are under the earth . but be at ease . we will make your stay with us pleasant . i am the guardian spirit of the sand mountains . they are my charge . i pile them up , and blow them about , and do whatever i will with them . it keeps me very busy , but i am hale for my age , and i love to be employed . i have often wished to get one of your race to marry among us . if you can make up your mind to remain , i will give you one of my daughters -- the one who smiled on you first , the night you were brought away from your parents and friends .
