the little hare , who took seven miles in a stride , was there in no time at all , and he stopped on the borders of a lake . ' the porcelain maiden , ' said the hare to the youth , ' will come here to bathe with her friends , while i just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me . when she is in the lake , be sure you hide her clothes , which are of dazzling whiteness , and do not give them back to her unless she consents to follow you . ' the little hare left him , and almost immediately the porcelain maiden arrived with her friends . she undressed herself and got into the water . then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of her clothes , which he hid under a rock at some distance .
