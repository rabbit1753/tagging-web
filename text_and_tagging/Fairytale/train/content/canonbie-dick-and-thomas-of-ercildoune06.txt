canonbie dick was apt to get very thirsty . his ordinary customers , knowing this , took care always to provide him with something to drink . the old man never did so . he paid down his money and led away his horses . there was an end of the matter . but one night , dick , being even more thirsty than usual . he was feeling sure that his mysterious friend must live somewhere in the neighbourhood . he saw that he was always wandering about the hillside when everyone else was asleep . he hinted that he would be very glad to go home with him and have a little refreshment .
