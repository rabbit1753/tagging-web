of all the young gallants in scotland in the thirteenth century , there was none more gracious and debonair than thomas learmont , laird of the castle of ercildoune , in berwickshire . he loved books , poetry , and music , which were uncommon tastes in those days ; and , above all , he loved to study nature , and to watch the habits of the beasts and birds that made their abode in the fields and woods round about his home . now it chanced that , one sunny may morning , thomas left his tower of ercildoune , and went wandering into the woods that lay about the huntly burn , a little stream that came rushing down from the slopes of the eildon hills . it was a lovely morning -- fresh , and bright , and warm , and everything was so beautiful that it looked as paradise might look .
