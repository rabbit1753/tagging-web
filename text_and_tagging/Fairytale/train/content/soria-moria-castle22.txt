" who do you think has first claim to the hand of one of us , " she asked , " the man who delivered us , or the one who now sits here in the bridegroom 's place ? " there was only one opinion as to that , and when halvor heard it , he did not delay , but cast off his rags and dressed himself as a bridegroom . " yes , he is the right one ! " cried the youngest princess when she caught sight of him , and she drove the other one away , and celebrated her wedding with halvor .
