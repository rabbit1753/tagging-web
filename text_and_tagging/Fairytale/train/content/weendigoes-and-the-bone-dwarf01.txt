in a lonely forest , there once lived a man and his wife , who had a son . the father went forth every day , according to the custom of the indians , to hunt for food to supply his family . one day , while he was absent , his wife , on going out of the lodge , looked toward the lake that was near , and she saw a very large man walking on the water , and coming fast toward the lodge . he was already so near that she could not , if she had wished to , escape by flight . she thought to herself , " what shall i say to the monster ? " as he advanced rapidly , she ran in , and taking the hand of her son , a boy of three or four years old , she led him out . speaking very loud , " see , my son , " she said , " your grandfather ; " and then added , in a tone of appeal and supplication , " he will have pity on us . " the giant approached and said , with a loud ha ! ha ! " yes , my son ; " and added , addressing the woman , " have you any thing to eat ? "
