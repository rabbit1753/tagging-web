he had not been long underway before it occurred to him to test what the ring could do . so he wished to be dressed in new clothes from head to toe , and no more had he uttered the wish than there he was in them . and he looked as handsome and bright as a new nickel . then he thought to himself it would be pleasant to play a trick on his father . " he was none too friendly to me while i was still at home . " and so the youth wished he were standing before his father 's door , just as ragged as he had been before . and that very minute there he stood . " good - day , father , and many thanks for the last time ! " said the youth . but when his father saw he had come home far more tattered and torn than when he had gone away , he grew angry and began to scold : " there is nothing to be made of you , if during all the long years of your service you have not even been able to earn a suit of clothes to your back . "
