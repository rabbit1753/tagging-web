she dried her eyes quickly , and going to the cupboard took out the box that contained the mirror , her heart beating with expectation as she lifted the mirror out and gazed into its smooth face . behold , her mother 's words were true ! in the round mirror before her she saw her mother 's face ; but , oh , the joyful surprise ! it was not her mother thin and wasted by illness , but the young and beautiful woman as she remembered her far back in the days of her own earliest childhood . it seemed to the girl that the face in the mirror must soon speak , almost that she heard the voice of her mother telling her again to grow up a good woman and a dutiful daughter , so earnestly did the eyes in the mirror look back into her own . " it is certainly my mother 's soul that i see . she knows how miserable i am without her and she has come to comfort me . whenever i long to see her she will meet me here ; how grateful i ought to be !
