' why did you refuse to sell my wife a pumpkin yesterday when she wanted one ? ' he asked . ' the old ones are finished , and the new ones are not yet come , ' answered the girl . ' when her slave arrived two days ago , there were only four left ; but i gave him one , and would take no corn for it . ' ' i do not believe you ; you have sold them all to other people . i shall go and cut down the pumpkin , ' cried her brother in a rage . ' if you cut down the pumpkin you shall cut off my hand with it , ' exclaimed the girl , running up to her tree and catching hold of it . but her brother followed , and with one blow cut off the pumpkin and her hand too . then he went into the house and took away everything he could find , and sold the house to a friend of his who had long wished to have it , and his sister had no home to go to . meanwhile she had bathed her arm carefully , and bound on it some healing leaves that grew near by , and wrapped a cloth round the leaves , and went to hide in the forest , that her brother might not find her again .
