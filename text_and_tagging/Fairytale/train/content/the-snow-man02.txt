' there it is again on the other side ! ' said the snow - man , by which he meant the sun was appearing again . ' i have become quite accustomed to its glaring . i hope it will hang there and shine , so that i may be able to see myself . i wish i knew , though , how one ought to see about changing one 's position . i should very much like to move about . if i only could , i would glide up and down the ice there , as i saw the boys doing ; but somehow or other , i do n't know how to run . ' ' bow - wow ! ' barked the old yard - dog ; he was rather hoarse and could n't bark very well . his hoarseness came on when he was a house - dog and used to lie in front of the stove . ' the sun will soon teach you to run ! i saw that last winter with your predecessor , and farther back still with his predecessors ! they have all run away ! ' ' i do n't understand you , my friend , ' said the snow - man . ' that thing up there is to teach me to run ? ' he meant the moon . ' well , it certainly did run just now , for i saw it quite plainly over there , and now here it is on this side . ' ' you know nothing at all about it , ' said the yard - dog . ' why , you have only just been made . the thing you see there is the moon ; the other thing you saw going down the other side was the sun . he will come up again tomorrow morning , and will soon teach you how to run away down the gutter . the weather is going to change ; i feel it already by the pain in my left hind - leg ; the weather is certainly going to change .
