the youth departed , weeping , and met the little hare , who was munching wild thyme . ' what are you crying for , my friend ? ' asked the hare . ' it is because , ' he answered , ' the castle people will not allow me to carry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maiden in exchange . ' ' you have not followed my advice , ' said the little hare . ' and you have put the golden bird into the fine cage . ' ' alas ! yes ! ' ' do n't despair ! the porcelain maiden is a young girl , beautiful as venus , who dwells two hundred miles from here . jump on my back and i will take you there . '
