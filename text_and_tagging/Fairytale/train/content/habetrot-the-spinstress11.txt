maisie jumped up , and stood staring in front of her as if she had been moonstruck . for , just across the stream from where she had been sitting , there was a curious boulder , with a round hole in the middle of it -- for all the world like a big apple with the core taken out . maisie knew it well ; she had often sat upon it , and wondered how the funny hole came to be there . it was no wonder that she stared , for , seated on this stone , was the queerest little old woman that she had ever seen in her life . indeed , had it not been for her silver hair , and the white mutch with the big frill that she wore on her head , maisie would have taken her for a little girl , she wore such a very short skirt , only reaching down to her knees .
