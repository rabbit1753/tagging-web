the king 's son did what the serving - men had told him . he kept on wandering as far as he could , and never had any other food than the nuts and wild berries that grow in the forest . and when he had wandered far and long , he came to a mountain upon whose very top stood a fir - tree . said he to himself : " after all , i might as well climb the fir - tree and see whether i can find a path anywhere . " no sooner said than done : he climbed the tree . and as he sat in the very top of its crown , and looked about on every side , he saw a large and splendid royal castle rising in the distance , and gleaming in the sun . then he grew very happy and at once set forth in that direction . on the way he met a farm - hand who was ploughing , and begged him to change clothes with him , which he did . thus fitted out he at last reached the king 's castle , went in , asked for a place , and was taken on as a herdsman , to tend the king 's cattle . now he went to the forest early and late , and in the course of time forgot his grief , grew up , and became so tall and brave that his equal could not be found .
