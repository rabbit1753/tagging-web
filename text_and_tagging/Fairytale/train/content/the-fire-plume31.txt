the tobacco was now divided in equal shares among the company . they filled their pipes -- and huge pipes they were -- and such clouds they blew , that they rushed forth out of the lodge and brought on night , in all the country round about , several hours before its time . after a while passed in silence , the spirits rose up , and bearing off their tobacco - sacks , they went smoking through the country , and losing themselves in their own fog , till a late hour in the morning , when all of their pipes being burned out , each departed on his own business . the very next day the old sand - spirit , who was very much pleased with the turn affairs had taken at his entertainment , addressed wassamo : " son - in - law , i have made up my mind to allow you another holiday as an acknowledgment of the handsome manner in which you acquitted yourself of your embassy . you may visit your parents and relatives once more , to tell them that their wishes are granted , and to take your leave of them forever . you can never , after , visit them again . " wassamo at once set out , reached his people , and was heartily welcomed . they asked for his wife , and wassamo informed them that she had tarried at home to look after a son , a fine little sand - spirit , who had been born to them since his return . having delivered all of his messages and passed a happy time , wassamo said , " i must now bid you all farewell forever .
