on the following day the clerk passed by the master girl 's little house . he saw it glistening and shining in the woods , and went in to find out who lived there . when he saw the beautiful girl he fell even more deeply in love with her than the bailiff had , and lost no time in suing for her hand . the master girl asked him , as she had asked the bailiff , whether he had plenty of money . money he had to spare , answered the clerk , and ran right home to fetch it . by evening he was back again with a great sack -- it must have been as much again as the bailiff had brought -- and stood it on the bench . and so she promised to take him . then she asked him to shut the house - door , which she said she had forgotten to do . but when he had the door - knob in his hand , she cried : " may god grant that you hold the door - knob and that the door - knob hold you , and that you move back and forth with it all night long until morning ! " and the clerk had to dance the whole night through , such a waltz as he had never tripped before , and he had no wish to repeat the experience . sometimes he was ahead , and sometimes the door was , and so they went back and forth all night , from wall to post and post to wall , and he was nearly bruised to death . first he cursed , then he wailed and pleaded ; but the door paid no attention to him , and flung open and shut until it dawned . when it at last released him , he hurried away as quickly as though he had stolen something , forgot his sackful of money , and his wish to marry , and was glad that the door did not come threshing along after him . all grinned and stared at the clerk , for he ran like a madman , and looked worse than if a ram had been butting him all night long .
