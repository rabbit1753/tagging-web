once upon a time there was a master mariner who had the most unheard of good fortune in all that he undertook ; none had such splendid cargoes , and none earned so much money as he did , for everything seemed to come to him . and it is quite certain that there were none who could risk taking the trips he did , for wherever he sailed he had fair winds , yes , it was even said that when he turned around his cap , the wind turned with it , to suit his wish . thus he sailed for many years with cargoes of lumber , and even went as far as china , and earned money like hay . but once he sailed the north sea with all sails set , as though he had stolen ship and cargo . but the one who was after him sailed even more swiftly . and that was sir urian , the devil ! with him the master mariner , as you may imagine , had made a bargain , and that very day and hour the contract expired , and the mariner had to be prepared , from moment to moment , to see him arrive to fetch him .
