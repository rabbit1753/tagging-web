in the middle of the plain he perceived a post , and something waving at its top . it was the wampum scalp ; and every now and then the air was rent with the war - song , for they were dancing the war - dance in high spirit around it . before he could be observed , maidwa changed himself into a humming - bird , and flew toward the scalp . as he passed some of those who were standing by , he came close to their ears , and as they heard the rapid whirr or murmur which this bird makes when it flies , they jumped aside , and asked each other what it could be . maidwa had nearly reached the scalp , but fearing that he should be perceived while untying it , he again changed himself into the down that floats lightly on the air , and sailed slowly on to the scalp . he loosened it , and moved off heavily , as the weight was almost too great for him to bear up . the indians around would have snatched it away had not a lucky current of air just then buoyed him up . as they saw that it was moving away they cried out , " it is taken from us ! it is taken from us !
