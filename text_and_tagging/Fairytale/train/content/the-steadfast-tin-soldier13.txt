there the tin - soldier lay , and felt a heat that was truly terrible ; but whether he was suffering from actual fire , or from the ardour of his passion , he did not know . all his colour had disappeared ; whether this had happened on his travels or whether it was the result of trouble , who can say ? he looked at the little lady , she looked at him , and he felt that he was melting ; but he remained steadfast , with his gun at his shoulder . suddenly a door opened , the draught caught up the little dancer , and off she flew like a sylph to the tin - soldier in the stove , burst into flames - and that was the end of her ! then the tin - soldier melted down into a little lump , and when next morning the maid was taking out the ashes , she found him in the shape of a heart . there was nothing left of the little dancer but her gilt rose , burnt as black as a cinder .
