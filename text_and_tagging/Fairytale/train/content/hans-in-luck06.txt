and when he came to an inn he made a halt , and in the joy of his heart ate up all the food he had brought with him , dinner and supper and all . he bought half a glass of beer with his last two farthings . then on he went again driving his cow , until he should come to the village where his mother lived . it was now near the middle of the day , and the sun grew hotter and hotter . hans found himself on a heath which it would be an hour 's journey to cross . and he began to feel very hot , and so thirsty that his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth .
