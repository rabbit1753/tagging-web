the fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other , for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be . " it does n't do that with a good will , " thought the fowl , and lifted up her head to peck at the caterpillar . the toad was so horrified at this , that she came crawling straight up towards the fowl . " aha , it has allies , " quoth the fowl . " just look at the crawling thing ! " and then the fowl turned away . " i do n't care for the little green morsel ; it would only tickle my throat . " the other fowls took the same view of it , and they all turned away together . " i writhed myself free , " said the caterpillar . " what a good thing it is when one has presence of mind ! but the hardest thing remains to be done , and that is to get on my leaf again . where is it ? "
