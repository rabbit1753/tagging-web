in a city in the neighborhood of kaiutschou there once lived a constable by the name of dung . one day when he returned from a hunt after thieves the twilight had already begun to fall . so before he waded through the stream that flowed through the city he sat down on the bank , lit a pipe and took off his shoes . when he looked up , he suddenly saw a man in a red hat dressed as a constable crouching beside him . astonished , he inquired : " who are you ? your clothes indicate that you are a member of our profession , but i have never yet seen you among the men of our local force . tell me , pray , whence you come ?
