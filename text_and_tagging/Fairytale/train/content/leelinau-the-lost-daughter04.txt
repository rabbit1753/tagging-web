she at length became so engrossed by the fairy pines that her parents began to suspect that some evil spirit had enticed her to its haunts , and had cast upon her a charm which she had not the power to resist . this belief was confirmed when , one day , her mother , who had secretly followed her , overheard her murmuring to some unknown and invisible companion , appeals like these : " spirit of the dancing leaves ! " whispered leelinau , " hear a throbbing heart in its sadness . spirit of the foaming stream ! visit thou my nightly pillow , shedding over it silver dreams of mountain brook and pebbly rivulet . spirit of the starry night ! lead my foot - prints to the blushing mis - kodeed , or where the burning passion - flower shines with carmine hue . spirit of the greenwood plume ! " she concluded , turning with passionate gaze to the beautiful young pines which stood waving their green beauty over her head , " shed on me , on leelinau the sad , thy leafy fragrance , such as spring unfolds from sweetest flowers , or hearts that to each other show their inmost grief . spirits ! hear , o hear a maiden 's prayer ! "
