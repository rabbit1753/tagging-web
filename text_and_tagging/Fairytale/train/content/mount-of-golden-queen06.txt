but she replied : " that i do not know . go ask my sister , who is nine yards taller than i am , and who lives in an earth - mound which you can find without any trouble . " so he left her and came to a mound of earth that looked just like the first , and from which smoke was also rising . a woman at once came out who was tremendously tall , and of her he asked the way to the mount of the golden queen . " that i do not know , " said she . " go ask my brother , who is nine yards taller than i am , and who lives in a hill a little further away . " so he came to the hill , from which smoke was also rising , and knocked . a man at once came out who was a veritable giant , for he was twenty - seven yards in length , and of him he asked the way to the mount of the golden queen . then the giant took a whistle and whistled in every direction , to call together all the animals to be found on the earth . and all the animals came from the woods , notably among them a bear .
