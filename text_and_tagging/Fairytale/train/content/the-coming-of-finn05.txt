" but , " said finn , " how is it that thy young warriors , valiant and swift , do not repel him , or kill him ? " " alas ! " said conn , " all our valour is in vain against this man . our hosts encompass tara on all sides , keeping watch and ward when the fatal night comes . then the son of midna plays on his druidic instrument of music , on his magic pipe and his magic lyre , and as the fairy music falls on our ears , our eyelids grow heavy , and soon all subside upon the grass in deep slumber . so comes this man against the city and shoots his fire - balls against it , and utterly consumes it . nine years he has burnt tara in that manner , and this is the tenth . at midnight to - night he will come and do the same . last year ( though it was a shame to me that i , who am the high king over all ireland , should not be able myself to defend tara ) i summoned gaul mac morna and all the fians to my assistance . they came , but the pipe and lyre of the son of midna prevailed over them too , so that tara was burned as at other times . nor have we any reason to believe that the son of midna will not burn the city again to - night , as he did last year . all the women and children have been sent out of tara this day . we are only men of war here , waiting for the time . that , o noble youth , is why we are sad . the ' pillars of tara ' are broken , and the might of the fians is as nought before the power of this man . " " what shall be my reward if i kill this man and save tara ? " asked finn .
