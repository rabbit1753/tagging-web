even the cross old neighbor could not refuse such a simple request , so he consented to give the old man the tree under which shiro lay buried . shiro 's master then cut the tree down and carried it home . out of the trunk he made a mortar . in this his wife put some rice , and he began to pound it with the intention of making a festival to the memory of his dog shiro . a strange thing happened ! his wife put the rice into the mortar , and no sooner had he begun to pound it to make the cakes , than it began to increase in quantity gradually till it was about five times the original amount . the cakes were turned out of the mortar as if an invisible hand were at work .
