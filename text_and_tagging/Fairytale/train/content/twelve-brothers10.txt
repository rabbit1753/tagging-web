now there was a little garden round the enchanted house , in which grew twelve tall lilies . the girl , wishing to please her brothers , plucked the twelve flowers , meaning to present one to each of them as they sat at supper . but hardly had she plucked the flowers when her brothers were turned into twelve ravens , who flew croaking over the wood , and the house and garden vanished also . so the poor girl found herself left all alone in the wood , and as she looked round her she noticed an old woman standing close beside her , who said : ' my child , what have you done ? why did n't you leave the flowers alone ? they were your twelve brothers . now they are changed for ever into ravens .
