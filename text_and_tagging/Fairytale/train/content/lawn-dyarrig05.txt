" you may be able to do well with that , " said the woman . " go out , now , to that stable abroad , and take the slim white steed that is in it . that one will never stop nor halt in any place till he brings you to the eastern world . if you like , take these two men behind you ; if not , let them walk . but i think it is useless for you to have them at all with you . " lawn dyarrig went out to the stable , took the slim white steed , mounted , rode to the front , and catching the two brothers , planted them on the horse behind him . " now , lawn dyarrig , " said the woman , " this horse will never stop till he stands on the little white meadow in the eastern world . when he stops , you 'll come down , and cut the turf under his beautiful right front foot . " the horse started from the door , and at every leap he crossed seven hills and valleys , seven castles with villages , acres , roods , and odd perches . he could overtake the whirlwind before him seven hundred times before the whirlwind behind him could overtake him once . early in the afternoon of the next day he was in the eastern world . when he dismounted , lawn dyarrig cut the sod from under the foot of the slim white steed , in the name of the father , son , and holy ghost , and terrible valley was down under him there . what he did next was to tighten the reins on the neck of the steed and let him go home . " now , " said lawn dyarrig to his brothers , " which would you rather be doing -- making a basket or twisting gads ( withes ) ? " " we would rather be making a basket ; our help is among ourselves , " answered they .
