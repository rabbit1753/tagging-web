the great fish said to the boy - man under water . " what is that floating ? " to which the boy - man replied : " go , take hold of it , swallow it as fast as you can . it is a great delicacy . " the fish darted toward the old shoe and swallowed it , making of it a mere mouthful . the boy - man laughed in himself , but said nothing , till the fish was fairly caught , when he took hold of the line and began to pull himself in his fish - carriage ashore . the sister , who was watching all this time , opened wide her eyes as the huge fish came up and up upon the shore . she opened them still more when the fish seemed to speak . she heard from within a voice , saying , " make haste and release me from this nasty place . " it was her brother 's voice , which she was accustomed to obey . she made haste with her knife to open a door in the side of the fish , from which the boy - man presently leaped forth . he lost no time in ordering her to cut it up and dry it , telling her that their spring supply of meat was now provided .
