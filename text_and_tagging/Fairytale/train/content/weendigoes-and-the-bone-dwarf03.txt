in this manner the weendigo and the hunter 's family lived for some time , and it surprised them that the monster never attempted their lives ; although he never slept at night , but always went out and returned , by the break of day , stained with blood , and looking very wild and famished . when there was no deer to be had wherewith to finish his repast , he said nothing . in truth he was always still and gloomy , and he seldom spoke to any of them ; when he did , his discourse was chiefly addressed to the boy . one evening , after he had thus sojourned with them for many weeks , he informed the hunter that the time had now arrived for him to take his leave , but that before doing so , he would give him a charm that would bring good luck to his lodge . he presented to him two arrows , and thanking the hunter and his wife for their kindness , the weendigo departed , saying , as he left them , that he had all the world to travel over . the hunter and his wife were happy when he was gone , for they had looked every moment to have been devoured by him . he tried the arrows , and they never failed to bring down whatever they were aimed at . they had lived on , prosperous and contented , for a year , when , one day , the hunter being absent , his wife on going out of the lodge , saw something like a black cloud approaching .
