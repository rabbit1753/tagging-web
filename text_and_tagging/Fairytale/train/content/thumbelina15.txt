' farewell , bright sun!'she cried , stretching out her arms towards it , and taking another step outside the house ; for now the corn had been reaped , and only the dry stubble was left standing . ' farewell , farewell!'she said , and put her arms round a little red flower that grew there . ' give my love to the dear swallow when you see him ! ' ' tweet , tweet ! ' sounded in her ear all at once . she looked up . there was the swallow flying past ! as soon as he saw thumbelina , he was very glad . she told him how unwilling she was to marry the ugly mole , as then she had to live underground where the sun never shone , and she could not help bursting into tears . ' the cold winter is coming now , ' said the swallow . ' i must fly away to warmer lands : will you come with me ? you can sit on my back , and we will fly far away from the ugly mole and his dark house , over the mountains , to the warm countries where the sun shines more brightly than here , where it is always summer , and there are always beautiful flowers . do come with me , dear little thumbelina , who saved my life when i lay frozen in the dark tunnel !
