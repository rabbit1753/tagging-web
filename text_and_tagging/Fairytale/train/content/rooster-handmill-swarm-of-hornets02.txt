when he came to the devil 's place , there stood a man out by the wood - pile making wood . the peasant went to him and asked whether he could tell him if they wanted to buy a pig in the devil 's place . " i 'll go in and ask , " said the man , " if you will make wood in my stead while i am gone . " " yes , i will do that gladly , " said the peasant , took the ax , stood at the wood - pile and began to make wood . and he worked and worked until evening came ; but the man did not return to tell him whether they would or would not buy a pig in the devil 's place .
