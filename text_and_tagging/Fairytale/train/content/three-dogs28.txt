now when the princes learned that the youth had delivered the king 's three daughters , a great jealousy took possession of them , and they thought of how badly they had fared in their own venture . and they took counsel together as to how they might get the better of the youth , and win power and glory for themselves . but they hid their evil plot till a favorable opportunity offered for carrying it out . then they suddenly threw themselves on their comrade , seized him by the throat and strangled him . and then they threatened to kill the princesses if they did not swear to keep silence . and since the king 's daughters were in the power of the princes , they did not dare say no . but they felt very sorry for the youth who had given up his life for them , and the youngest princess mourned with all her heart , and all her happiness was at an end .
