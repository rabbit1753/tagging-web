" man is the most conceited creature ! " said the stork . " listen how their jaws are wagging ; and for all that they ca n't clap properly . they boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language ! yes , a fine language truly ! why , it changes in every day 's journey we make . one of them does n't understand another . now , we can speak our language over the whole earth -- up in the north and in egypt . and then men are not able to fly , moreover . they rush along by means of an invention they call ' railway ; ' but they often break their necks over it . it makes my beak turn cold when i think of it . the world could get on without men . we could do without them very well , so long as we only keep frogs and earth - worms . " " that was a powerful speech , " thought the little toad . " what a great man that is yonder ! and how high he sits ! higher than ever i saw any one sit yet ; and how he can swim ! " she cried , as the stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions .
