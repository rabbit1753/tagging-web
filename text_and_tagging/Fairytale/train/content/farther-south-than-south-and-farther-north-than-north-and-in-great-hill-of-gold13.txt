the troll came that very moment and thrust his three heads into the door . " uff , it smells like christian blood here ! " said he . the young fellow struck at the heads with his bamboo cane , and the troll was dead in a minute . so they carried out the body and hid it . a little later the troll with six heads came home . " uff , it smells like christian blood here ! " said he . " some one must have crept into the place ! but what has become of the other troll ? " said he , when he did not see the troll with three heads . " he has not yet come home , " said the maidens . " he must have come home , " said the troll . " perhaps he has gone to look for the fellow who crept in here . " at that moment the young fellow struck all six of his heads with his bamboo cane , and the troll at once fell dead to the ground . then they dragged out the corpse .
