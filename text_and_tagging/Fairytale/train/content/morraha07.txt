" oh , what advantage has your tree over mine , on which there are three rods of magic and mastery growing ? " when i heard them arguing , and knew that the rods were there , i began to laugh . " oh , " said my wife , " why are you always laughing ? i believe it is at myself you are jesting , and i 'll walk with you no more . " " oh , it is not about you i am laughing . it is because i understand the language of the birds . " then i had to tell her what the birds were saying to one another . she was greatly delighted , and she asked me to go home , and she gave orders to the cook to have breakfast ready at six o'clock in the morning . i did not know why she was going out early , and breakfast was ready in the morning at the hour she appointed . she asked me to go out walking . i went with her . she went to the tree , and asked me to cut a rod for her . " oh , i will not cut it . are we not better without it ? " " i will not leave this till i get the rod , to see if there is any good in it . " i cut the rod , and gave it to her . she turned from me , and struck a blow on a stone and changed it . she struck a second blow on me , and made of me a black raven , and she went home , and left me after her . i thought she would come back . she did not come , and i had to go into a tree till morning . in the morning , at six o'clock , there was a bellman out , proclaiming that everyone who killed a raven would get a fourpenny bit . at last you would not find man or boy without a gun , nor , if you were to walk three miles , a raven that was not killed . i had to make a nest in the top of the parlour chimney , and hide myself all day till night came , and go out to pick up a bit to support me , till i spent a month . here she is herself ( to say ) if it is a lie i am telling . " it is not , " said she .
