where he now stood it was beautiful day . the heavens were clear , and the sun shone out as brightly to strong desire as on the first morning when he had put forth his little head from the door of his father 's lodge . he had not been long there , sauntering along the beach , when he displayed the glittering bowl by dipping water from the lake . very soon a number of canoes came off from the island . the men admired his dress , and were charmed with his beauty , and almost with one voice they all made proposals of marriage . these , strong desire promptly declined . when this was reported to red head , he ordered his royal bark to be launched by his chosen men of the oar , and crossed over to see this wonderful girl . as they approached the shore , strong desire saw that the ribs of the sorcerer 's canoe were formed of living rattlesnakes , whose heads pointed outward to guard him from his enemies . being invited , he had no sooner stepped into the canoe , than they began to hiss and rattle furiously , which put him in a great fright ; but the magician spoke to them , when they became pacified and quiet . shortly after they were at the landing upon the island . the marriage took place immediately ; and the bride made presents of various valuables which had been furnished her by the old witch who inhabited the cloudy lodge .
