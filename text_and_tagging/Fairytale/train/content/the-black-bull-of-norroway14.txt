and in the morning , before she left , they presented her with the largest pear that she had ever seen , and warned her that she must not break it until she was in the direst strait that she had ever been in , and then , if she broke it , it would bring her out of it . the third day was the same as the other two had been . the princess and the black bull of norroway rode many a weary mile , and at sundown they came to another castle , more splendid by far than the other two . this castle belonged to the black bull 's youngest brother , and here the princess abode all night ; while the bull , as usual , lay outside in the park . and this time , when they departed , the princess received a most lovely plum , with the warning not to break it till she was in the greatest strait that mortal could be in . then she was to break it , and it would set her free . on the fourth day , however , things were changed . for there was no fine castle waiting for them at the end of their journey ; on the contrary , as the shadows began to lengthen , they came to a dark , deep glen , which was so gloomy and so awesome - looking that the poor princess felt her courage sinking as they approached it .
