the proposal pleased the two others , and forthwith they started on their travels . soon they came to a little brook , and as there was no stepping - stone , and no bridge , they could not tell how they were to get to the other side . the straw was struck with a good idea , and said , " i will lay myself across , so that you can go over me as if i were a bridge ! " so the straw stretched himself from one bank to the other , and the coal , who was of an ardent nature , quickly trotted up to go over the new - made bridge . when , however , she reached the middle , and heard the water rushing past beneath her , she was struck with terror , and stopped , and could get no farther . so the straw began to get burnt , broke in two pieces , and fell in the brook . the coal slipped down , hissing as she touched the water , and gave up the ghost . the bean , who had prudently remained behind on the bank , could not help laughing at the sight . not being able to contain herself , she went on laughing so excessively that she burst . and now would she certainly have been undone for ever , if a tailor on his travels had not by good luck stopped to rest himself by the brook . as he had a compassionate heart , he took out needle and thread and stitched her together again . the bean thanked him in the most elegant manner , but as he had sewn her up with black stitches , all beans since then have a black seam .
