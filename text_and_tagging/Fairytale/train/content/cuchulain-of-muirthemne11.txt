but all through the year ness was working to keep the kingdom for him . she gave great presents to the chief men of ulster to get them on her side . and though conchubar was but a young lad at the time , he was wise in his judgments and brave in battle , and good in shape and in form . they liked him well . and at the end of the year , when fergus asked to have the kingship back again , they consulted together . it is what they agreed , that conchubar was to keep it . and they said , " it is little fergus thinks about us , when he was so ready to give up his rule over us for a year . let conchubar keep the kingship , " they said , " and let fergus keep the wife he has got . " now , it happened one day that conchubar was making a feast at emain macha for the marriage of his sister dechtire with sualtim , son of roig . and at the feast dechtire was thirsty , and they gave her a cup of wine , and as she was drinking it a mayfly flew into the cup , and she drank it down with the wine . and presently she went into her sunny parlour , and her fifty maidens along with her , and she fell into a deep sleep . and in her sleep lugh of the long hand appeared to her , and he said , " it is i myself was the mayfly that came to you in the cup , and it is with me you must come away now , and your fifty maidens along with you . " and he put on them the appearance of a flock of birds . they went with him southward till they came to brugh na boinne , the dwelling - place of the sidhe . and no one at emain macha could get tale or tidings of them , or know where they had gone , or what had happened them .
