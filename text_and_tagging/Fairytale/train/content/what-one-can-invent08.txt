" we were distributed , by the king 's command , from the council - houses through the various towns , and proclamation was made of our great value . but no one believed in it , or even understood how to plant us . one man dug a hole in the earth and threw in his whole bushel of potatoes . another put one potato here and another there in the ground , and expected that each was to come up a perfect tree , from which he might shake down potatoes . and they certainly grew , and produced flowers and green watery fruit , but it all withered away . nobody thought of what was in the ground -- the blessing -- the potato . yes , we have endured and suffered , that is to say , our forefathers have ; they and we , it is all one . " what a story it was !
