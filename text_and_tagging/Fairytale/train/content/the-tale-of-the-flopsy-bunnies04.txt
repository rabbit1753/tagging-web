the little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass ; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific . they dreamt that their mother flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed . mr . mcgregor looked down after emptying his sack . he saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings . he stared at them for some time . presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved . mr . mcgregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap-- " one , two , three , four ! five ! six leetle rabbits ! " said he as he dropped them into his sack . the flopsy bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed . they stirred a little in their sleep , but still they did not wake up .
