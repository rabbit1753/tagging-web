sentaro , in his wish to escape from the country of perpetual life , recollected jofuku , who had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death . he prayed to the saint to bring him back to his own land again . no sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket . sentaro was amazed to see that it had remained undamaged after all these years . once more the bird grew and grew till it was large enough for him to mount it . as he did so , the bird spread its wings and flew , swiftly out across the sea in the direction of japan . such was the willfulness of the man 's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left behind . he tried to stop the bird in vain . the crane held on its way for thousands of miles across the ocean .
