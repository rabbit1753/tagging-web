at last the woman came back again , and said in a gruff voice , ' good evening , zachiel ; when the young moon shines in the basket , you are freed early , zachiel . ' then joringel was free . he fell on his knees before the old woman and implored her to give him back his jorinde , but she said he should never have her again , and then went away . he called after her , he wept and lamented , but all in vain . ' what is to become of me ! ' he thought . then he went away , and came at last to a strange village , where he kept sheep for a long time . he often went round the castle while he was there , but never too close . at last he dreamt one night that he had found a blood - red flower , which had in its centre a beautiful large pearl .
