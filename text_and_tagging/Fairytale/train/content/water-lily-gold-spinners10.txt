as the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy , for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all . on this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut . presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses , and soon the armed troop appeared , led by the prince , who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand , in order to know the way . when he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse , lifted her into the saddle , and then , mounting behind , rode homeward . the moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees .
