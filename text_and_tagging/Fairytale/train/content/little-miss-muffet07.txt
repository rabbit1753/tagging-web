little miss muffet went out in a very angry and sulky mood . " what 's the use of being in the country , " she thought , " if i must act just as i did in the city ? i hate nurse holloweg , and sarah , and all the rest of them ! and if i dared i 'd just - just run away . " indeed , a few minutes later , when sarah had fallen asleep upon a bench under a big shade tree , miss muffet decided she would really run away for once in her life , and see how it seemed . there was a pretty lane near by , running between shady trees far out into the country , and , stealing softly away from sarah 's side , the little girl ran as fast as she could go , and never stopped until she was all out of breath . while she rested and wondered what she could do next , a farmer came along , driving an empty cart .
