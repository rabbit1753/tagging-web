jemima puddle - duck was a simpleton : not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious . she went round the farm - garden , nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck . and she waddled into the kitchen , and got two onions out of a basket . the collie - dog kep met her coming out , " what are you doing with those onions ? where do you go every afternoon by yourself , jemima puddle - duck ? " jemima was rather in awe of the collie ; she told him the whole story . the collie listened , with his wise head on one side ; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers . he asked several questions about the wood , and about the exact position of the house and shed . then he went out , and trotted down the village . he went to look for two fox - hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher .
