in the evening the giant came home with his goats . " did you fetch the horse ? " he asked . " yes , master , " said the king 's son . " it would make a fine saddle - horse , but i just took it straight to the stable . " " i 'll have to see that , " said the giant , and went into the stable . but there stood the horse , just as the king 's son had said . " you surely must have spoken to my master girl , for you could not have done that alone , " said the giant . " yesterday the master chattered about the master girl , and to - day he is talking about her again . i wish master would show me the creature , for i surely would like to see her , " said the king 's son , and pretended to be very simple and stupid . " you will get to see her in plenty of time , " said the giant .
