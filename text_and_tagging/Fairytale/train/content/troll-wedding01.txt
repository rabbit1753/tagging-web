one summer , a long , long time ago , the folk of melbustad went up to the hill pastures with their herd . but they had been there only a short time when the cattle began to grow so restless that it was impossible to keep them in order . a number of different maidens tried to manage them , but without avail ; until one came who was betrothed , and whose betrothal had but recently been celebrated . then the cattle suddenly quieted down , and were easy to handle . so the maiden remained alone in the hills with no other company than a dog . and one afternoon as she sat in the hut , it seemed to her that her sweetheart came , sat down beside her , and began to talk about their getting married at once . but she sat still and made no reply , for she noticed a strangeness about him . by and by , more and more people came in . they began to cover the table with silverware , and bring on dishes . the bridesmaids brought the bridal crown , and the ornaments , and a handsome bridal gown . they dressed her , and put the crown on her head , as was the custom in those days , and they put rings on her hands .
