bokwewa tried to dissuade him from it ; but he would not be turned aside from his purpose . " since you are resolved , " said bokwewa , " listen to my advice . you will have to go south . it is a long distance to the present abiding - place of your wife , and there are so many charms and temptations by the way that i fear you will be led astray and forget your errand . for the people whom you will see in the country through which you have to pass , do nothing but amuse themselves . they are very idle , gay and effeminate , and i fear that they will lead you astray . your path is beset with dangers . i will mention one or two things which you must be on your guard against . " in the course of your journey you will come to a large grape - vine lying across your path . you must not even taste its fruit , for it is poisonous . step over it . it is a snake . you will next come to something that looks like bear 's fat , of which you are so fond . touch it not , or you will be overcome by the soft habits of the idle people . it is frog 's eggs . these are snares laid by the way for you . " kwasynd promised that he would observe the advice and bidding his brother farewell , he set out . after traveling a long time he came to the enchanted grape - vine . it looked so tempting , with its swelling purple clusters , that he forgot his brother 's warning , and tasted the fruit . he went on till he came to the frog 's eggs . they so much resembled delicious bear 's fat that kwasynd tasted them . he still went on .
