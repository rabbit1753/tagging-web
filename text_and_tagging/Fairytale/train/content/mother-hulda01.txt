a widow had two daughters ; one was pretty and industrious , the other was ugly and lazy . and as the ugly one was her own daughter , she loved her much the best , and the pretty one was made to do all the work , and be the drudge of the house . every day the poor girl had to sit by a well on the high road and spin until her fingers bled . now it happened once that as the spindle was bloody , she dipped it into the well to wash it ; but it slipped out of her hand and fell in . then she began to cry , and ran to her step - mother , and told her of her misfortune ; and her step - mother scolded her without mercy , and said in her rage , " as you have let the spindle fall in , you must go and fetch it out again !
