" i am come , " she said , " because i am beloved of murtough , son of erc , king of erin , and i come to seek him here . " then murtough was glad , and he said , " dost thou not know me , maiden ? " " i do , " she answered , " for all secret and mysterious things are known to me and thou and all the men of erin are well known . " after he had conversed with her awhile , she appeared to him so fair that the king was ready to promise her anything in life she wished , so long as she would go with him to cletty of the boyne . " my wish , " she said , " is that you take me to your house , and that you put out from it your wife and your children because they are of the new faith , and all the clerics that are in your house , and that neither your wife nor any cleric be permitted to enter the house while i am there .
