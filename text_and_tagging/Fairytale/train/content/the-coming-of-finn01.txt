it was the eve of samhain , which we christians call all hallows ' eve . the king of ireland , conn , the hundred - fighter , sat at supper in his palace at tara . all his chiefs and mighty men were with him . on his right hand was his only son , art the solitary , so called because he had no brothers . the sons of morna , who kept the boy finn out of his rights and were at the time trying to kill him if they could , were here too . chief amongst them was gaul mac morna , a huge and strong warrior , and captain of all the fians ever since that battle in which finn 's father had been killed . and gaul 's men were with him . the great long table was spread for supper . a thousand wax candles shed their light through the chamber , and caused the vessels of gold , silver , and bronze to shine . yet , though it was a great feast , none of these warriors seemed to care about eating or drinking ; every face was sad , and there was little conversation , and no music . it seemed as if they were expecting some calamity . conn 's sceptre , which was a plain staff of silver , lay beside him on the table , and there was a canopy of bright bronze over his head . gaul mac morna , captain of the fians , sat at the other end of the long table . every warrior wore a bright banqueting mantle of silk or satin , scarlet or crimson , blue , green , or purple , fastened on the breast either with a great brooch or with a pin of gold or silver . yet , though their raiment was bright and gay , and though all the usual instruments of festivity were there , and a thousand tall candles shed their light over the scene , no one looked happy .
