the princess 's suitors were about to give over the contest , for none of them had won the prize , though each had played a man 's part . and while they stood there thinking it over , and saying that perhaps fortune would favor them the next time , they suddenly saw a youth ride out of the wood , straight toward the mountain . he was clad in silver from head to foot , with helmet on head , shield on arm , and sword at side , and he sat his horse with such knightly grace that a braver - looking youth had probably never been seen . at once all eyes were turned toward him , and the people noticed that he was the same knight who had appeared before . but the prince did not leave them much time for wonderment ; for no sooner had he reached the plain , than he rose in his stirrups , spurred on his horse , and rode like fire straight up the steep mountain . yet he did not ride quite up to the top ; but when he had come to its crest , he greeted the princess with great courtesy , flung about his steed , and rode down the mountain again till the sparks flew about his horse 's hoofs . then he disappeared into the wood as the storm flies . as one may imagine , the people 's excitement was even greater than the first time , and there was not one who did not admire the strange knight . and all were agreed that a more splendid steed or a handsomer youth were nowhere to be found .
