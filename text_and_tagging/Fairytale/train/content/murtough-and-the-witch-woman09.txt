" fair , indeed , it is , " replied the king ; " for neither the kings of leinster nor the kings of mighty ulster , nor the lords of the clans of owen or of niall , have such a house as this ; nay , in tara of the kings itself , no house to equal this house of mine is found . " and that night the king robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity , and on his right hand he seated sheen , and a great banquet was made before them , and men said that never on earth was to be seen a woman more goodly of appearance than she .
