" surely i will never be in a sorer strait than i am now , " she said to herself ; and she drew out the apple and broke it . and , lo and behold ! it was filled with the most beautiful precious stones that she had ever seen ; and at the sight of them a plan came suddenly into her head . she took the precious stones out of the apple , and , putting them into a corner of her kerchief , carried them to the washerwoman . " see , " said she , " i am richer than mayhap thou thoughtest i was . and if thou wilt , all these riches may be thine . "
