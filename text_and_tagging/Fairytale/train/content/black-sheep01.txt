it was a bright spring day , and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures , where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious . the sheep had had a strange experience that morning , for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them , and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy , soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears .
