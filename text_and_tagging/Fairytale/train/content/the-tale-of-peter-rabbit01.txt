once upon a time there were four little rabbits , and their names were-- flopsy , mopsy , cotton - tail , and peter . they lived with their mother in a sand - bank , underneath the root of a very big fir tree . " now , my dears , " said old mrs . rabbit one morning , " you may go into the fields or down the lane , but do n't go into mr . mcgregor 's garden : your father had an accident there ; he was put in a pie by mrs . mcgregor . " " now run along , and do n't get into mischief . i am going out . "
