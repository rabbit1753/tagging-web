at midnight of the seventh day , as sentaro knelt in the temple , the door of the innermost shrine flew open . jofuku appeared in a luminous cloud , and calling to sentaro to come nearer , spoke thus : " your desire is a very selfish one and can not be easily granted . you think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the elixir of life . do you know how hard a hermit 's life is ? a hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees . a hermit must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire . gradually after following these strict rules , the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold or heat . his body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp , and can walk on water without getting his feet wet . " " you , sentaro , are fond of good living and of every comfort . you are not even like an ordinary man , for you are exceptionally idle . you more sensitive to heat and cold than most people . you would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time ! do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit 's life ? " " in answer to your prayer , however , i will help you in another way . i will send you to the country of perpetual life , where death never comes - where the people live forever ! " saying this , jofuku put into sentaro 's hand a little crane made of paper , telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there .
