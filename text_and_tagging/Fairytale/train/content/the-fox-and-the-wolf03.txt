but the wily fox was fond of butter , and he made up his mind that he would have it all to himself . so he put on his wisest look , and shook his head gravely . " you have no prudence , my friend , " he said reproachfully , " else would you not talk of breaking up a keg of butter at this time of year , when the stackyards are full of good grain , which can be had for the eating , and the farmyards are stocked with nice fat ducks and poultry . no , no . it behoveth us to have foresight , and to lay up in store for the spring , when the grain is all threshed , and the stackyards are bare , and the poultry have gone to market . so we will e'en bury the keg , and dig it up when we have need of it . " very reluctantly , for he was thinner and hungrier than the fox , the wolf agreed to this proposal . so a hole was dug , and the keg was buried , and the two animals went off hunting as usual .
