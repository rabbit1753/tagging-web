the king and queen and the princess , too , stood in the hall - way , and wondered what sort of a fellow this was , who could herd hares without losing a single one . the king reckoned and added them up , and counted with his fingers , and then added them up again ; but not even the teeny - weeniest hare was missing . " he is quite a chap , he is , " said the princess . the following day he again went to the forest , and herded his hares . but while he lay in all comfort beside a strawberry patch , they sent out the chamber - maid from the castle to him , and she was to find out how he managed to herd the king 's hares .
