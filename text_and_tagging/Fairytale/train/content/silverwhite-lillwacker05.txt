when the king 's daughter and her maid saw the old woman , who was sitting beneath the window , they felt a great longing to try the beautiful apples . so they called out and asked how much she wanted for her precious apples . the old woman said they were not for sale . yet as the girls kept on pleading with her , the old woman said she would make each of them a present of an apple . they only need let down a little basket from the tower . the princess and her maid , in all innocence , did as the troll - woman told them , and each received an apple . but the enchanted fruit had a strange effect , for in due course of time heaven sent them each a child . the king 's daughter called her son silverwhite , and the son of her maid received the name of lillwacker .
