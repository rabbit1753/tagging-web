after a time the priest came by , and he was so old and decrepit that his wife and daughter led him . and when they came to the spot where the schoolmaster was standing , they stopped and invited him to come to church and hear mass . the schoolmaster thought for a moment ; but since it occurred to him that it might be amusing to see how these people worshiped god , he said he would go along , if he did not thereby suffer harm . no , no harm should come to him , said they , but rather a blessing . in the church all went forward in a quiet and orderly manner , there were neither dogs nor crying children to disturb the service , and the singing was good -- but he could not make out the words . when the priest had been led to the pulpit he delivered what seemed to the listening schoolmaster a really fine and edifying sermon -- but one , it appeared to him , of quite a peculiar trend of thought , which he was not always able to follow . nor did the " our father in heaven ... " sound just right , and the " deliver us from evil ... " he did not hear at all . nor was the name of jesus uttered ; and at the close no blessing was spoken .
