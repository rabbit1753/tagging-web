some days afterwards the same thing happened . the fox was asked to another christening ; this time at a place some twenty - five miles along the shore . and as he had grumbled before , so he grumbled again ; but he declared that it was his duty to go , and he went . at midnight he came back , smiling to himself and with no appetite for his supper . and when the wolf asked him the name of the child , he answered that it was a more extraordinary name than the other--"be na inheadnon " ( be in its middle ) . the very next week , much to the wolf 's wonder , the fox was asked to yet another christening . and this time the name of the child was " sgriot an clar " ( scrape the staves ) . after that the invitations ceased .
