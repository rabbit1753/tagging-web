and again he dreamed of the princess on the mount of the golden queen , and that she came to him , and laid a letter and a band of gold in his pocket . then he awoke and to his indescribable surprise , he found in his pocket both of the things of which he had dreamed , the letter and the band . now he had no time to attend to the cattle any longer , but drove them straight home . then he went into the stable , led out a horse , sold it , and bought seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes with the money . he made the thole - pins out of the iron , put on his iron shoes , and set forth . for a time he traveled by land . at last he came to the lake which he had to cross . he saw nothing but water before and behind him , and rowing so long and steadily that he wore out one thole - pin after another . he at length reached land , and a green meadow , where no trees grew . he walked all around the meadow , and at last found a mound of earth from which smoke was rising . when he looked more closely , out came a woman who was nine yards long . he asked her to tell him the way to the mount of the golden queen .
