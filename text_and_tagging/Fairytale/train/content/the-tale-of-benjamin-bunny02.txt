old mrs . rabbit was a widow ; she earned her living by knitting rabbit - wool mittens and muffetees ( i once bought a pair at a bazaar ) . she also sold herbs , and rosemary tea , and rabbit - tobacco ( which is what we call lavender ) . little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt . he came round the back of the fir - tree , and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter . peter was sitting by himself . he looked poorly , and was dressed in a red cotton pocket - handkerchief .
