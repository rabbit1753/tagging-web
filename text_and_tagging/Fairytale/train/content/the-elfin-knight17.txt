" is there naught that i can do to rescue him ! " cried earl st . clair eagerly , " ere he taketh on him the elfin shape ? i have no fear of the spell of his cruel captor , for i bear the sign of one who is stronger than he . speak speedily , little man , for time presseth . " " there is something that thou couldst do , sir earl , " whispered the goblin , " but to essay it were a desperate attempt . for if thou failest , then could not even the power of the blessed sign save thee . " " and what is that ? " asked the earl impatiently . " thou must remain motionless , " answered the old man , " in the cold and frost till dawn break and the hour cometh when they sing matins in the holy church . then must thou walk slowly nine times round the edge of the enchanted circle , and after that thou must walk boldly across it to the red marble table where sits the elfin king . on it thou wilt see an emerald goblet studded with rubies and filled with heather ale . that must thou secure and carry away ; but whilst thou art doing so let no word cross thy lips . for this enchanted ground whereon we dance may look solid to mortal eyes , but in reality it is not so . it is but a quaking bog , and under it is a great lake , wherein dwelleth a fearsome monster , and if thou so much as utter a word while thy foot resteth upon it , thou wilt fall through the bog and perish in the waters beneath .
