" this is a glorious gift , " it said . " the bright stars have always been a joy to me and have always shone more brilliantly than i ever could shine , though i have tried with my whole might . now they have noticed me , a poor old lamp , and have sent me a gift that will enable me to see clearly everything that i remember , as if it still stood before me , and to let it be seen by all those who love me . and herein lies the truest happiness , for pleasures which we can not share with others are only half enjoyed .
