the king urged and pressed him , first amiably , then in anger ; but the duke remained obstinate and would have nothing to say . then the king fell into a rage , which is not very surprising , for now he realized that this fine duke was not what he purported to be , and he therefore ordered him to be hung , and hung on the spot . it is true that the princess pleaded earnestly for him , but tears and prayers were useless now , for he was a rascal and should die a rascal 's death -- thus spake the king .
