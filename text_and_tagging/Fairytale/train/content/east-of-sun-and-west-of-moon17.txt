" so you are that girl , " said the woman . " well , my child , i am sorry to say that all i know of him is that he lives in the castle that is east of the sun and west of the moon , and that you will probably never get there . but i will loan you my horse , on which you may ride to my neighbor , and perhaps she can tell you . and when you get there just give the horse a blow back of his left ear , and order him to go home . and here , take this golden apple along ! " the maiden mounted the horse , and rode a long , long time . at length she again came to a hill , before which sat an old woman with a golden reel . the maiden asked whether she could not tell her the road which led to the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon . this woman said just what the other had , no , she knew no more of the castle than that it lay east of the sun and west of the moon . " and , " said she , " you will probably never get there . but i will loan you my horse to ride to the nearest neighbor . perhaps she can tell you . and when you have reached her just give the horse a blow back of his left ear , and order him to go home again . " and finally she gave the maiden the golden reel , for , said the old woman , it might be useful to her .
