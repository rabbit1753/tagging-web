one evening kung could not remove his glance from hiang - nu . the youth guessed his thoughts and said to him : " you are as yet unmarried . early and late i keep thinking as to how i can provide you with a charming life companion . hiang - nu is the serving - maid of my father , so i can not give her to you . " said kung : " i am grateful to you for your friendly thought . but if the girl you have in mind is not just as beautiful as hiang - nu , then i would rather do without . " the youth laughed : " you are indeed inexperienced if you think that hiang - nu is beautiful . your wish is easily fulfilled . "
