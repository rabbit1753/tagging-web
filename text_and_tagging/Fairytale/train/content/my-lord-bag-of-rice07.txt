" was it you that called me just now ? " " yes , it was i , " answered the man : " i have an earnest request to make to you . do you think you can grant it to me ? " " if it is in my power to do so i will , " answered hidesato , " but first tell me who you are ? " " i am the dragon king of the lake , and my home is in these waters just under this bridge . " " and what is it you have to ask of me ? " said hidesato . " i want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede , who lives on the mountain beyond , " and the dragon king pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake . " i have lived now for many years in this lake and i have a large family of children and grand - children . for some time past we have lived in terror , for a monster centipede has discovered our home , and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family . i am powerless to save them . if it goes on much longer like this , not only shall i lose all my children , but i myself must fall a victim to the monster . i am , therefore , very unhappy , and in my extremity i determined to ask the help of a human being .
