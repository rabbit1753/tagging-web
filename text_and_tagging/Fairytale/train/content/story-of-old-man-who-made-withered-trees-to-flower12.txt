when the old man and his wife saw this , they understood that it was a reward to them from shiro for their faithful love to him . they tasted the cakes and found them nicer than any other food . so from this time they never troubled about food . they lived upon the cakes with which the mortar never ceased to supply them . the greedy neighbor , hearing of this new piece of good luck , was filled with envy as before . he called on the old man and asked leave to borrow the wonderful mortar for a short time , pretending that he , too , sorrowed for the death of shiro , and wished to make cakes for a festival to the dog 's memory .
