" and who are you really and truly ? " he asked . " o , i am the big crooked one of etnedal , " said the monster troll . then per gynt did not waste any time , but shot three bullets right through the middle of his head . " shoot again ! " cried the crooked one . but per gynt knew better , for had he shot another time , the bullet would have rebounded and hit him . when this had been done , per gynt and his dogs took hold of the great troll , and dragged him out of the hut , so that they might make themselves comfortable there . and meanwhile the hills about rang with laughter and jeers . " per gynt pulled hard , but the dogs pulled harder ! " rang in his ears .
