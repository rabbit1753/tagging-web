when the pancake heard that it was frightened , turned itself around suddenly , and wanted to get out of the pan . but it only fell on its other side , and when this had baked a little , so that it took shape and grew firmer , it leaped out on the floor . and it rolled off like a wheel , out of the door , and down the street . hey there ! the woman was after it with the pan in one hand , and the spoon in the other , as fast as she could , and after her came the children , and last of all , their grandfather came hobbling along .
