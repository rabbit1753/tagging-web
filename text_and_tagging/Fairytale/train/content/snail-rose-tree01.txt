round about the garden ran a hedge of hazel - bushes ; beyond the hedge were fields and meadows with cows and sheep ; but in the middle of the garden stood a rose - tree in bloom , under which sat a snail , whose shell contained a great deal -- that is , himself . " only wait till my time comes , " he said ; " i shall do more than grow roses , bear nuts , or give milk , like the hazel - bush , the cows and the sheep . " " i expect a great deal from you , " said the rose - tree . " may i ask when it will appear ? " " i take my time , " said the snail . " you 're always in such a hurry . that does not excite expectation . "
