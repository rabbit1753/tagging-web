" during his mortal life he was a wine - dealer , " answered the pastor , " and he watered the wine he sold . " this did not strike the youth as being such a terrible crime . " even if he had to pay for it with his life , " said he , " one might now grant him a christian burial , and let him rest in peace . " but the pastor said that this could not be done at all . people would be needed to break him out of the ice ; and money would be needed to buy a grave for him from the church ; and the gravedigger would want to be paid for his trouble ; and the sexton for tolling the bells ; and the cantor for singing ; and the pastor himself for the funeral sermon .
