" i only came for the loan of that flail that i see hanging on the collar - beam for the king of dublin to give a thrashing to the danes . " " well , " says the other , " the danes is much better customers to me . but , since you walked so far , i wo n't refuse . hand that flail , " says he to a young imp . he winked the far - off eye at the same time .
