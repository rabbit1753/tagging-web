she on her part did not know what he meant , for she had never heard of the superstition that by praying over an image it is possible to cause the death of a hated person . but she saw that she must speak and clear herself somehow . she loved her father dearly , and could not bear the idea of his anger . she put out her hand on his knee deprecatingly : " father ! father ! do not say such dreadful things to me . i am still your obedient child . indeed , i am . however stupid i may be , i should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you , much less pray for the death of one you love . surely some one has been telling you lies , and you are dazed , and you know not what you say - or some evil spirit has taken possession of your heart . as for me i do not know - no , not so much as a dew - drop , of the evil thing of which you accuse me . " but the father remembered that she had hidden something away when he first entered the room , and even this earnest protest did not satisfy him . he wished to clear up his doubts once for all .
