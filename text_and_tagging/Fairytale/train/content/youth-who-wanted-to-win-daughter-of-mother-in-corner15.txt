" mother , mother , come out , come out ! " cried the youth . his mother came to the door , clasped her hands together over her head , and nearly fainted with joy when she saw all the fine goods . and then the youth had to tell her how it had come to him , and all that had taken place , from beginning to end . this brought them a small fortune , as you may imagine . the youth had new clothes , and his mother went to town and sold the goods , yard by yard , and was handsomely paid for them . and then she decorated her room , and she herself , in her old days , went about in such style that she might have been taken for some lady of distinction . so they lived splendidly and happily , but finally this money , too , came to an end . one day the woman had not a bite to eat left in the house , and told her son that now he had better look for work , and really do something , or both of them would starve to death .
