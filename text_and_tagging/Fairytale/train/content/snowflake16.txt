and snowflake grew fast ; each hour as well as each day made a difference , and every day she became more and more beautiful . the old couple hardly knew how to contain themselves for joy , and thought of nothing else . the cottage was always full of village children , for they amused snowflake , and there was nothing in the world they would not have done to amuse her . she was their doll , and they were continually inventing new dresses for her , and teaching her songs or playing with her . nobody knew how clever she was ! she noticed everything , and could learn a lesson in a moment . anyone would have taken her for thirteen at least ! and , besides all that , she was so good and obedient ; and so pretty , too ! her skin was as white as snow , her eyes as blue as forget - me - nots , and her hair was long and golden . only her cheeks had no colour in them , but were as fair as her forehead .
