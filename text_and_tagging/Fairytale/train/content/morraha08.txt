then i saw her out walking . i went up to her , and i thought she would turn me back to my own shape , and she struck me with the rod and made of me an old white horse . she ordered me to be put to a cart with a man to draw stones from morning till night . i was worse off then . she spread abroad a report that i had died suddenly in my bed , and prepared a coffin , and waked me , and buried me . then she had no trouble . but when i got tired , i began to kill everyone who came near me , and i used to go into the haggard every night and destroy the stacks of corn . when a man came near me in the morning , i would follow him till i broke his bones . everyone got afraid of me . when she saw i was doing mischief , she came to meet me , and i thought she would change me . and she did change me , and made a fox of me . when i saw she was doing me every sort of damage , i went away from her . i knew there was a badger 's hole in the garden , and i went there till night came , and i made great slaughter among the ducks and geese . there she is herself to say if i am telling a lie . " oh , you are telling nothing but the truth , only less than the truth . " when she had enough of my killing the fowl , she came out into the garden , for she knew i was in the badger 's hole . she came to me , and made me a wolf . i had to be off , and go to an island , where no one at all would see me , and now and then i used to be killing sheep , for there were not many of them , and i was afraid of being seen and hunted ; and so i passed a year , till a shepherd saw me among the sheep , and a pursuit was made after me . and when the dogs came near me , there was no place for me to escape to from them ; but i recognised the sign of the king among the men , and i made for him , and the king cried out to stop the hounds . i took a leap upon the front of the king 's saddle , and the woman behind cried out , " my king and my lord , kill him , or he will kill you .
