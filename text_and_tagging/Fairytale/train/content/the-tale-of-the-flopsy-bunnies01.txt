it is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is " soporific . " i have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces ; but then i am not a rabbit . they certainly had a very soporific effect upon the flopsy bunnies ! when benjamin bunny grew up , he married his cousin flopsy . they had a large family , and they were very improvident and cheerful . i do not remember the separate names of their children ; they were generally called the " flopsy bunnies . " as there was not always quite enough to eat,--benjamin used to borrow cabbages from flopsy 's brother , peter rabbit , who kept a nursery garden . sometimes peter rabbit had no cabbages to spare .
