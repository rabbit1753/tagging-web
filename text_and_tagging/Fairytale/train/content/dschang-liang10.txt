dschang liang took the book and aided the ancestor of the han dynasty to conquer the empire . the emperor made him a count . from that time forward dschang liang ate no human food and concentrated in spirit . he kept company with the four whitebeards of the shang mountain , and with them shared the sunset roses in the clouds . once he met two boys who were singing and dancing : " green the garments you should wear , if to heaven 's gate you 'd fare ; there the golden mother greet , bow before the wood lord 's feet ! " when dschang liang heard this , he bowed before the youths , and said to his friends : " those are angel children of the king father of the east . the golden mother is the queen of the west . the lord of wood is the king father of the east . they are the two primal powers , the parents of all that is male and female , the root and fountain of heaven and earth , to whom all that has life is indebted for its creation and nourishment . the lord of wood is the master of all the male saints , the golden mother is the mistress of all the female saints . whoever would gain immortality , must first greet the golden mother and then bow before the king father . then he may rise up to the three pure ones and stand in the presence of the highest . the song of the angel children shows the manner in which the hidden knowledge may be acquired .
