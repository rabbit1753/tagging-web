at last , however , the sunball became aware how sad letiko was . he sent her a second time to bring straw , and , slipping in after her , he heard how she lamented for her mother . then he went home , called two foxes to him , and said : ' will you take letiko home ? ' ' yes , why not ? ' ' but what will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way ? ' ' we will eat her flesh and drink her blood . ' when the sunball heard that , he said : ' you are not suited for this affair . ' then he sent them away , and called two hares to him , and said : ' will you take letiko home to her mother ? ' ' yes , why not ? ' ' what will you eat and drink if you should become hungry and thirsty by the way ? ' ' we will eat grass and drink from streamlets . ' ' then take her , and bring her home . '
