the hunter 's son followed , and having come to the tree , he beheld the face of the boy looking out through an opening in the hollow part . " ha ! ha ! " he said , " my friend , come out and play with me ; " and he urged the boy till he consented . they played and shot their arrows by turns . suddenly the young boy said , " your father is coming . we must stop . promise me that you will not tell him . " the hunter 's son promised , and the other disappeared in the tree . when the hunter returned from the chase , his son sat demurely by the fire . in the course of the evening he asked his father to make him a new bow ; and when he was questioned as to the use he could find for two bows , he answered that one might break or get lost . the father pleased at his son 's diligence in the practice of the bow , made him the two weapons ; and the next day , as soon as his father had gone away , the boy ran to the hollow tree , and invited his little friend to come out and play ; at the same time presenting to him the new bow . they went and played in the lodge together , and in their sport they raised the ashes all over it . suddenly again the youngest said , " your father is coming , i must leave .
