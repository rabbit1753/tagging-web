hase - hime was a skilled musician though so young , and often astonished her masters by her wonderful memory and talent . on this momentous occasion she played well . but princess terute , her step - mother , who was a lazy woman and never took the trouble to practice daily , broke down in her accompaniment and had to request one of the court ladies to take her place . this was a great disgrace , and she was furiously jealous to think that she had failed where her step - daughter succeeded . to make matters worse the emperor sent many beautiful gifts to the little princess to reward her for playing so well at the palace . there was also now another reason why princess terute hated her step - daughter , for she had had the good fortune to have a son born to her , and in her inmost heart she kept saying : " if only hase - hime were not here , my son would have all the love of his father . " and never having learned to control herself , she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step - daughter 's life . so one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine . this poisoned wine she put into a bottle . into another similar bottle she poured some good wine . it was the occasion of the boys ' festival on the fifth of may , and hase - hime was playing with her little brother . all his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them . they were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes .
