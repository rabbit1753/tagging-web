the princess 's suitors were about to give up the contest , for none of them had won the prize , though each had done his best . and while they stood there thinking it over , and saying that perhaps fortune would favor them another time , they suddenly saw a youth ride out of the wood straight toward the mountain . he was clad in steel from head to foot , with helmet on head , sword in belt and shield on arm , and he sat his horse with such knightly grace that it was a pleasure to look at him . at once all eyes were turned to the strange knight , and all asked who he might be ; for none had ever seen him before . yet they had had but little time to talk and question , for no sooner had he cleared the wood , than he rose in his stirrups , gave his horse the spurs , and shot forward like an arrow straight up the glass mountain . yet he did not ride up all the way ; but when he had reached the middle of the steep ascent , he suddenly flung around his steed and rode down again , so that the sparks flew from his horse 's hoofs . then he disappeared in the wood like a bird in flight . one may imagine the excitement which now seized upon all the people , and there was not one who did not admire the strange knight . all agreed they had never seen a braver knight .
