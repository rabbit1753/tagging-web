they asked of her , " who art thou , maiden , and wherefore art thou come to the house of mourning ? for a king lies buried here . " " a king lies buried here , indeed , " said she , " and i it was who slew him , murtough of the many deeds , of the race of conn and niall , high king of ireland and of the west . and though it was i who wrought his death , i myself will die for grief of him . " and they said , " tell us , maiden , why you brought him to his death , if so be that he was dear to thee ? " and she said , " murtough was dear to me , indeed , dearest of the men of the whole world ; for i am sheen , the daughter of sige , the son of dian , from whom ath sigi or the ' ford of sige ' is called to - day . but murtough slew my father , and my mother and sister were slain along with him , in the battle of cerb upon the boyne , and there was none of my house to avenge their death , save myself alone . moreover , in his time the ancient peoples of the fairy tribes of erin were scattered and destroyed , the folk of the underworld and of my fatherland ; and to avenge the wrong and loss he wrought on them i slew the man i loved . i made poison for him ; alas ! i made for him magic drink and food which took his strength away , and out of the sods of earth and puff - balls that float down the wind , i wrought men and armies of headless , hideous folk , till all his senses were distraught . and , now , take me to thee , o cairnech , in fervent and true repentance , and sign the cross of christ upon my brow , for the time of my death is come . " then she made penitence for the sin that she had sinned , and she died there upon the grave of grief and of sorrow after the king . and they digged a grave lengthways across the foot of the wide grave of murtough and his spouse , and there they laid the maiden who had wrought them woe . and the clerics wondered at those things , and they wrote them and revised them in a book .
