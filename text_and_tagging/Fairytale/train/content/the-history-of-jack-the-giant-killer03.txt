jack took a horn , a shovel , a pickaxe , his armor , and a dark lantern , and one winter 's evening he went to the mount . there he dug a pit twenty - two feet deep and twenty broad . he covered the top over so as to make it look like solid ground . he then blew his horn so loudly that the giant awoke and came out of his den crying out : " you saucy villain ! you shall pay for this i 'll broil you for my breakfast ! " he had just finished , when , taking one step further , he tumbled headlong into the pit , and jack struck him a blow on the head with his pickaxe which killed him . jack then returned home to cheer his friends with the news .
