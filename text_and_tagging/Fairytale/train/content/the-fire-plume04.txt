suddenly he heard a laugh it was double , or the one must be the perfect echo of the other . to wassamo there appeared to be two persons at no great distance . " cousin , " said wassamo , " some person is near us . i hear a laugh ; awake and let us look out ! " the cousin made no answer . again wassamo heard the laughter in mirthful repetition , like the ripple of the water - brook upon the shining pebbles of the stream . peering out as far as the line of the torchlight pierced into the darkness , he beheld two beautiful young females smiling on him . their countenances appeared to be perfectly white , like the fresh snow . he crouched down and pushed his cousin , saying , in a low voice , " awake ! awake ! here are two young women . " but he received no answer . his cousin seemed lost to all earthly sense and sound ; for he lay unmoved , smiling , in the calm light of the moon . wassamo started up alone , and glided toward the strange females . as he approached them he was more and more enraptured with their beauty ; but just as he was about to speak to them , he suddenly fell to the earth , and they all three vanished together . the moon shone where they had just stood , but she saw them not . a gentle sound of music and soft voices accompanied their vanishing , and this wakened the cousin .
