at last her mother grew really angry , and one bright spring morning she laid down three heads of lint on the table , saying sharply , " i will have no more of this dallying . people will say that it is my blame that no wooer comes to seek thee . i can not have thee left on my hands to be laughed at , as the idle maid who would not marry . so now thou must work ; and if thou hast not these heads of lint spun into seven hanks of thread in three days , i will e'en speak to the mother at st . mary 's convent , and thou wilt go there and learn to be a nun . " now , though maisie was an idle girl , she had no wish to be shut up in a nunnery ; so she tried not to think of the sunshine outside , but sat down soberly with her distaff . but , alas ! she was so little accustomed to work that she made but slow progress ; and although she sat at the spinning - wheel all day , and never once went out of doors , she found at night that she had only spun half a hank of yarn . the next day it was even worse , for her arms ached so much she could only work very slowly . that night she cried herself to sleep ; and next morning , seeing that it was quite hopeless to expect to get her task finished , she threw down her distaff in despair , and ran out of doors . near the house was a deep dell , through which ran a tiny stream . maisie loved this dell , the flowers grew so abundantly there . this morning she ran down to the edge of the stream , and seated herself on a large stone . it was a glorious morning , the hazel trees were newly covered with leaves , and the branches nodded over her head , and showed like delicate tracery against the blue sky . the primroses and sweet - scented violets peeped out from among the grass , and a little water wagtail came and perched on a stone in the middle of the stream , and bobbed up and down , till it seemed as if he were nodding to maisie , and as if he were trying to say to her , " never mind , cheer up .
