so the whole party turned back ; and when they reached the laird 's house the prince ordered a search to be made in the courtyard . and the bonnie little sister was soon discovered and brought out , all blushes and confusion , from her hiding - place behind the caldron . " give her the slipper , and let her try it on , " said the prince , and the eldest sister was forced to obey . and what was the horror of the bystanders , as she drew it off , to see that she had cut off the tops of her toes in order to get it on . but it fitted her little sister 's foot exactly , without either paring or clipping ; and when the prince saw that it was so , he lifted the elder sister down from his horse and lifted the little one up in her place , and carried her home to his palace , where the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing ; and for the rest of their lives they were the happiest couple in the whole kingdom .
