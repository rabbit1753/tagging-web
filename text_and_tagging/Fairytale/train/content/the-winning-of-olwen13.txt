' whose is this castle , o herdsmen ? ' asked the knights . ' you are truly stupid , ' answered the herdsman . ' all the world knows that this is the castle of yspaddaden penkawr . ' ' and who are you ? ' ' i am called custennin , brother of yspaddaden , and ill has he treated me . and who are you , and what do you here ? ' ' we come from arthur the king , to seek olwen the daughter of yspaddaden , ' but at this news the shepherd gave a cry : ' o men , be warned and turn back while there is yet time . others have gone on that quest , but none have escaped to tell the tale , ' and he rose to his feet as if to leave them . then kilweh held out to him a ring of gold , and he tried to put it on his finger , but it was too small , so he placed it in his glove , and went home and gave it to his wife .
