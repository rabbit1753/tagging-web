all that night he practiced what is known as chemical sorcery ; so that when claribel sudds came next day at two o'clock he showed her a small box filled with compounds that closely resembled french bonbons . " this is a progressive age , " said the old man , " and i flatter myself your uncle daws keeps right along with the procession . now , one of your old - fashioned sorcerers would have made you some nasty , bitter pills to swallow ; but i have consulted your taste and convenience . here are some magic bonbons . if you eat this one with the lavender color you can dance thereafter as lightly and gracefully as if you had been trained a lifetime . after you consume the pink confection you will sing like a nightingale . eating the white one will enable you to become the finest elocutionist in the land . the chocolate piece will charm you into playing the piano better than rubenstein , while after eating you lemon - yellow bonbon you can easily kick six feet above your head .
