the table on which the tin soldiers stood , was covered with other playthings , but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle . through the small windows the rooms could be seen . in front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking - glass , which was intended to represent a transparent lake . swans , made of wax , swam on the lake , and were reflected in it . all this was very pretty , but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady , who stood at the open door of the castle ; she , also , was made of paper , and she wore a dress of clear muslin , with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf . in front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose , as large as her whole face .
