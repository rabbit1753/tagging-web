then gopani - kufa calmed himself , and drew out zengi - mizi from its rush basket . ' o spirit of my father ! ' he said , ' what now shall i do ? ' ' o gopani - kufa ! ' hummed the wasp , ' there is nothing now that can be done , for the words of the antelope which you slew are being fulfilled . ' ' alas ! i am an old man -- i had forgotten ! ' cried the chief . ' the words of the antelope were true words -- my reward shall be my undoing -- they are being fulfilled ! ' then the white men fell upon the people of gopani - kufa and slew them together with the chief and his daughter shasasa ; and since then all the power of the earth has rested in the hands of the white men , for they have in their possession sipao , the magic mirror .
