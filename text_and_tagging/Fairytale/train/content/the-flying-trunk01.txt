there was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street , and perhaps even a little side - street besides , with silver . but he did not do that ; he knew another way of spending his money . if he spent a shilling he got back a florin - such an excellent merchant he was till he died . now his son inherited all this money . he lived very merrily ; he went every night to the theatre , made paper kites out of five - pound notes , and played ducks and drakes with sovereigns instead of stones . in this way the money was likely to come soon to an end , and so it did .
