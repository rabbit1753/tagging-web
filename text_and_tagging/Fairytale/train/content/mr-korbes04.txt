then mr . korbes came home , and went to the hearth to make a fire , but the cat threw ashes in his eyes . then he ran quickly into the kitchen to wash himself , but the duck splashed water in his face . then he was going to wipe it with the towel , but the egg broke in it , and stuck his eyelids together . in order to get a little peace he sat down in his chair , but the pin ran into him , and , starting up , in his vexation he threw himself on the bed , but as his head fell on the pillow , in went the needle , so that he called out with the pain , and madly rushed out . but when he reached the housedoor the mill - stone jumped up and struck him dead . what a bad man mr . korbes must have been !
