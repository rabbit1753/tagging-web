the giant passed on before me and crossed eas roe ( now ballyshannon ) , of the son of modhuirn , without wetting his foot . i leaped over it after him . he then directed his course towards the estuary of binn - edair , keeping the circuit of eire to his right hand . the giant leaped over the estuary , and it was a leap similar to flight over the sea . i sprang after him , and having caught him by the small of the back , laid him prostrate on the earth . ' you have dealt unjustly by me , o fionn , ' cried the giant . ' for it was not with you i arranged the combat , but with the fenians . ' i replied that the fenians were not perfect , except i myself were with them . we had not remained long thus when liagan luaimneach , from luachar deaghaidh , came to us . he was followed by caoilte mac ronan , together with the swiftest of the fenians . each of them couched his javelin , intending to drive it through the giant and kill him in my arms , but i protected him from their attacks . soon after this the main body of the fenians arrived . they enquired what was the cause of the delay that the giant had not been slain . ' that is bad counsel , ' said the giant , ' for a better man than i am would be slain in my eric . ' we bound the giant strongly on that occasion . soon after bran beag o'buadhchan came to invite me to a feast , and all the fenians of eire , who had been present , accompanied him to his house .
