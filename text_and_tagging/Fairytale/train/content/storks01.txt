on the last house in the village there lay a stork 's nest . the mother stork sat in it with her four little ones , who were stretching out their heads with their pointed black bills that had not yet turned red . at a little distance , on the top of the roof , stood the father stork , bolt upright and as stiff as could be . that he might not appear quite idle while standing sentry , he had drawn one leg up under him , as is the manner of storks . one might have taken him to be carved in marble , so still did he stand .
