the following morning it was no better . the man set out as early as possible , and had not as yet reached town before he met the old woman with the basket . " good - day , granny , " said the man . " and good - day to you , daddy , " said the old woman . " what have you in your basket to - day ? " asked the man . " if you want to know , then buy it ! " was again the answer . " what does it cost ? " asked the man . she wanted four shillings for it , she had only the one price . the man said he would buy it , for he thought that this time he would make a better purchase . he raised the cover , and this time a kitten lay in the basket . when he reached home , there stood the youth , waiting to see what he was to get in lieu of his second year 's wages . " are you back again , master ! " said he . " yes , indeed , " said the master . " what did you buy to - day ? " asked the youth . " alas , nothing better than i did yesterday , " said the man , " but i did as we agreed , and bought the first thing i came across , and that was this kitten . " " you could not have hit on anything better , " said the youth , " for all my life long i have been fond of cats as well as of dogs . " " i do not fare so badly this way , " thought the man , " but when he sets out for himself , then the matter will probably turn out differently . "
