long , long ago there lived a widow who had three sons . the two eldest were grown up , and though they were known to be idle fellows , some of the neighbours had given them work to do on account of the respect in which their mother was held . but at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer . so home they went to their mother and youngest brother , of whom they thought little , because he made himself useful about the house , and looked after the hens , and milked the cow . ' pinkel , ' they called him in scorn , and by - and - by ' pinkel ' became his name throughout the village . the two young men thought it was much nicer to live at home and be idle than to be obliged to do a quantity of disagreeable things they did not like , and they would have stayed by the fire till the end of their lives had not the widow lost patience with them and said that since they would not look for work at home they must seek it elsewhere , for she would not have them under her roof any longer . but she repented bitterly of her words when pinkel told her that he too was old enough to go out into the world , and that when he had made a fortune he would send for his mother to keep house for him . the widow wept many tears at parting from her youngest son , but as she saw that his heart was set upon going with his brothers , she did not try to keep him . so the young men started off one morning in high spirits , never doubting that work such as they might be willing to do would be had for the asking , as soon as their little store of money was spent .
