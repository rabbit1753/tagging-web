so the brother refrained from drinking , though his thirst was great , and he said he would wait till he came to the next brook . when they came to a second brook the sister heard it say , " he a wolf will be who drinks of me , who drinks of me a wolf will be ! " then the sister cried , " pray , dear brother , do not drink , or you will be turned into a wolf , and will eat me up ! " so the brother refrained from drinking , and said , " i will wait until we come to the next brook , and then i must drink , whatever you say ; my thirst is so great . " and when they came to the third brook the sister heard how in its rushing it said , " who drinks of me a fawn will be , he a fawn will be who drinks of me ! " then the sister said , " o my brother , i pray drink not , or you will be turned into a fawn , and run away far from me . " but he had already kneeled by the side of the brook and stooped and drunk of the water , and as the first drops passed his lips he became a fawn .
