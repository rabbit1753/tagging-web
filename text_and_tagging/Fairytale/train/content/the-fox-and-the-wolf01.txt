there was once a fox and a wolf , who set up house together in a cave near the sea - shore . although you may not think so , they got on very well for a time , for they went out hunting all day , and when they came back at night they were generally too tired to do anything but to eat their supper and go to bed . they might have lived together always had it not been for the slyness and greediness of the fox , who tried to over - reach his companion , who was not nearly so clever as he was . and this was how it came about .
