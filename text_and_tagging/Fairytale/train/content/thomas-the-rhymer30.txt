when he heard the boy 's message , the seer 's face grew grave and wrapt . " it is a summons , " he said softly , " a summons from the queen of fairy - land . i have waited long for it , and it hath come at last . " and when he went out , instead of joining the little company of waiting men , he walked straight up to the snow - white hart and hind . as soon as he reached them they paused for a moment as if to greet him . then all three moved slowly down a steep bank that sloped to the little river leader , and disappeared in its foaming waters , for the stream was in full flood . and , although a careful search was made , no trace of thomas of ercildoune was found ; and to this day the country folk believe that the hart and the hind were messengers from the elfin queen , and that he went back to fairy - land with them .
