and the king of the polar bears had courage to bear his pain and lived and was strong again . the feathers grew as they had grown upon the bodies of the birds and covered him as his own hair had done . mostly they were pure white in color , but some from the gray gulls gave his majesty a slight mottled appearance . the rest of that summer and all through the six months of night the king left his icy cavern only to fish or catch seals for food . he felt no shame at his feathery covering , but it was still strange to him , and he avoided meeting any of his brother bears .
