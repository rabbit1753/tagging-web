the great bear had never seen such creatures before , and therefore advanced toward the boat , sniffing the strange scent with aroused curiosity and wondering whether he might take them for friends or foes , food or carrion . when the king came near the water 's edge a man stood up in the boat and with a queer instrument made a loud " bang ! " the polar bear felt a shock ; his brain became numb ; his thoughts deserted him ; his great limbs shook and gave way beneath him and his body fell heavily upon the hard ice . that was all he remembered for a time . when he awoke he was smarting with pain on every inch of his huge bulk , for the men had cut away his hide with its glorious white hair and carried it with them to a distant ship . above him circled thousands of his friends the gulls , wondering if their benefactor were really dead and it was proper to eat him . but when they saw him raise his head and groan and tremble they knew he still lived , and one of them said to his comrades : " the wolves were right . the king is a great magician , for even men can not kill him . but he suffers for lack of covering . let us repay his kindness to us by each giving him as many feathers as we can spare .
