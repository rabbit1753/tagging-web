' this time you 've made a mistake , ' thought prince milan , and going to his room he sat down at the window . ' just fancy my not recognising the beautiful hyacinthia ! why , that is the easiest thing in the world . ' ' not so easy as you think , ' cried the little bee , who was flying past . ' if i were n't to help you , you 'd never guess . we are thirty sisters so exactly alike that our own father can hardly distinguish us apart . ' ' then what am i to do ? ' asked prince milan . ' listen , ' answered hyacinthia . ' you will recognise me by a tiny fly i shall have on my left cheek , but be careful for you might easily make a mistake . '
