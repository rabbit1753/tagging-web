" so , as there seemed nothing else for it , the princess hired herself to the smith for seven long years : to clean his house , and cook his food , and make and mend his clothes . at the end of that time he fashioned her a pair of iron shoon , with which she climbed the mountain of glass with as much ease as if it had been covered with fresh green turf . when she had reached the summit , and descended to the other side , the first house that she came to was the house of an old washerwoman , who lived there with her only daughter . and as the princess was now very tired , she went up to the door , and knocked , and asked if she might be allowed to rest there for the night .
