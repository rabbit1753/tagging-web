after wassamo had been among these curious people several months , the old sand - spirit said to him , " son - in - law , you must not be surprised at what you will see next ; for since you have been with us you have never known us to go to sleep . it has been summer when the sun never sets here where we live . but now , what you call winter , is coming on . you will soon see us lie down , and we shall not rise again till the spring . take my advice . do not leave the lodge . i have sure knowledge that that knavish island spirit is on the prowl , and as he has command of a particular kind of storm , which comes from the south - west , he only waits his opportunity to catch you abroad and do you a mischief . try and amuse yourself . that cupboard , " pointing to a corner of the lodge , " is never empty ; for it is there that all the offerings are handed in while we are asleep . it is never empty , and-- " but ere the old sand - spirit could utter another word , a loud rattling of thunder was heard , and instantly , not only the old spirit but every one of his family , vanished out of sight . when the storm had passed by , they all reappeared in the lodge . this sudden vanishing and reappearance occurred at every tempest .
