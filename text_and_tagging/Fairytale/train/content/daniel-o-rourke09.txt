' it was all to no manner of use ; he spread out his great big wings , burst out a laughing , and flew away like lightning . i bawled after him to stop ; but i might have called and bawled for ever , without his minding me . away he went , and i never saw him from that day to this -- sorrow fly away with him ! you may be sure i was in a disconsolate condition , and kept roaring out for the bare grief , when all at once a door opened right in the middle of the moon , creaking on its hinges as if it had not been opened for a month before -- i suppose they never thought of greasing them -- and out there walks -- who do you think but the man in the moon himself ? i knew him by his bush . ' good morrow to you , daniel o'rourke , ' says he , ' how do you do ? ' ' very well , thank your honour , ' says i. ' i hope your honour 's well . ' ' what brought you here , dan ? ' said he . so i told him how i was a little overtaken in liquor at the master 's , and how i was cast on a dissolute island , and how i lost my way in the bog , and the thief of an eagle promised to fly me out of it , and how , instead of that , he had fled me up to the moon .
