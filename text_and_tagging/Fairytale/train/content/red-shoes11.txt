she danced , and was obliged to go on dancing through the dark night . the shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding ; she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house . here , she knew , lived the executioner ; and she tapped with her finger at the window and said : " come out , come out ! i can not come in , for i must dance . " and the executioner said : " i do n't suppose you know who i am . i strike off the heads of the wicked , and i notice that my axe is tingling to do so . " " do n't cut off my head ! " said karen , " for then i could not repent of my sin . but cut off my feet with the red shoes . " and then she confessed all her sin , and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes ; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest . and he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches , and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners ; she kissed the hand that guided the axe , and went away over the heath .
