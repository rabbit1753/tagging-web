in fear they for a time held their peace , but still taking note that the stranger came so often and by stealth to the lodge , they resolved at last to speak with their father . accordingly one day , when they were out in the woods , learning to follow the chase , they told him all that they had seen . the face of the father grew dark . he was still for a while , and when at length he looked up- " it is done ! " he said . " do you , my children , tarry here until the hour of the falling of the sun , then come to the lodge and you will find me . " the father left them at a slow pace , and they remained sporting away their time till the hour for their return had come . when they reached the lodge the mother was not there . they dared not to ask their father whither she had gone , and from that day forth her name was never spoken again in the lodge . in course of time the two boys had grown to be men , and although the mother was never more seen in the lodge , in charge of her household tasks , nor on the path in the forest , nor by the river side , she still lingered , ever and ever , near the lodge .
