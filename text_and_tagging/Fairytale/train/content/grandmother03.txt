grandmother is dead now . she had been sitting in her arm - chair , telling us a long , beautiful tale ; and when it was finished , she said she was tired , and leaned her head back to sleep awhile . we could hear her gentle breathing as she slept ; gradually it became quieter and calmer , and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace . it was as if lighted up with a ray of sunshine . she smiled once more , and then people said she was dead . she was laid in a black coffin , looking mild and beautiful in the white folds of the shrouded linen , though her eyes were closed ; but every wrinkle had vanished , her hair looked white and silvery , and around her mouth lingered a sweet smile . we did not feel at all afraid to look at the corpse of her who had been such a dear , good grandmother . the hymn - book , in which the rose still lay , was placed under her head , for so she had wished it ; and then they buried grandmother .
