the maiden then mounted the horse , and again rode a long , long time . at length she once more came to a great hill , before which sat an old woman spinning at a golden spindle . then the maiden once more asked after the prince , and the castle that lay east of the sun and west of the moon . and everything happened exactly as on the two previous occasions . " do you happen to be the maiden the prince wanted to marry ? " asked the old woman . " yes , i am that maiden , " answered the maiden . but this old woman knew no more about the road than the two others . " yes , the castle lies east of the sun and west of the moon , that i know , " said she . " and you will probably never get there . but i will loan you my horse , and you may ride on it to the east wind and ask him . perhaps he is acquainted there , and can blow you thither . and when you reach him , just give my horse a blow back of the left ear , and then he will return here of his own accord . " finally the old woman gave her her golden spindle . " perhaps it may be useful to you , " said she .
