but the sister was very terrified when she saw that her fawn was wounded . she washed his foot , laid cooling leaves round it , and said , " lie down on your bed , dear fawn , and rest , that you may be soon well . " the wound was very slight , so that the fawn felt nothing of it the next morning . and when he heard the noise of the hunting outside , he said , " i can not stay in , i must go after them ; i shall not be taken easily again ! " the sister began to weep , and said , " i know you will be killed , and i left alone here in the forest , and forsaken of everybody . i can not let you go ! " " then i shall die here with longing , " answered the fawn ; " when i hear the sound of the horn i feel as if i should leap out of my skin . " then the sister , seeing there was no help for it , unlocked the door with a heavy heart , and the fawn bounded away into the forest , well and merry . when the king saw him , he said to his hunters , " now , follow him up all day long till the night comes , and see that you do him no hurt . " so as soon as the sun had gone down , the king said to the huntsmen : " now , come and show me the little house in the wood . " and when he got to the door he knocked at it , and cried , " little sister , let me in ! " then the door opened , and the king went in , and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before . the maiden shrieked out when she saw , instead of the fawn , a man standing there with a gold crown on his head . but the king looked kindly on her , took her by the hand , and said , " will you go with me to my castle , and be my dear wife ? " " oh yes , " answered the maiden , " but the fawn must come too . i could not leave him . " and the king said , " he shall remain with you as long as you live , and shall lack nothing . " then the fawn came bounding in , and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him , and led him by her own hand out of the little house .
