when she came into the church - yard , it seemed to her as though she were surrounded by a great crowd of people . in those days people wore broad mantles of unbleached wool , woven at home , and white in color . she was wearing one of these mantles and the specters seized it . but she flung it away from her and managed to escape from the church - yard , and run to the poor - house and wake the people there . it is said it was then one o'clock at night .
