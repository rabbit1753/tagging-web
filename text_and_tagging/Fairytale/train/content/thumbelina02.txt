' what a beautiful flower!'exclaimed the woman , and she kissed the red and yellow petals ; but as she kissed them the flower burst open . it was a real tulip , such as one can see any day ; but in the middle of the blossom , on the green velvety petals , sat a little girl , quite tiny , trim , and pretty . she was scarcely half a thumb in height ; so they called her thumbelina . an elegant polished walnut - shell served thumbelina as a cradle , the blue petals of a violet were her mattress , and a rose - leaf her coverlid . there she lay at night , but in the day - time she used to play about on the table ; here the woman had put a bowl , surrounded by a ring of flowers , with their stalks in water , in the middle of which floated a great tulip pedal , and on this thumbelina sat , and sailed from one side of the bowl to the other , rowing herself with two white horse - hairs for oars . it was such a pretty sight ! she could sing , too , with a voice more soft and sweet than had ever been heard before .
