at length it grew late again , evening came and the dog returned home from the forest as usual . but again the princess could not control her curiosity ; no sooner was her husband sleeping than she rose quietly , lit her lamp , and drew near carefully in order to look at him while he slept . and when the light fell on the youth , he appeared to be handsomer than ever before , and the longer she looked the more handsome he grew , until her heart burned in her breast , and she forgot all else in the world looking at him . she could not take her eyes from him , and sat up all night bending over his pillow . and when morning came and the sun rose , the youth began to move and awaken . then the princess was much frightened , because she had paid no heed to the passing of time , and she tried to put out her lamp quickly . but her hand trembled , and a warm drop of oil fell on the youth and he awoke . when he saw what she had done , he leaped up , terrified , instantly turned into a lame dog , and limped out into the forest . but the princess felt so remorseful that she nearly lost her senses , and she ran after him , wringing her hands and weeping bitterly , and begging him to return . but he did not come back .
