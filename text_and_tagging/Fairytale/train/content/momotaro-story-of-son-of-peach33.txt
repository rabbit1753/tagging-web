the dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it . but the bird struck out its spurs and flew at the dog 's tail , and the fight went hard with both . momotaro , as he looked on , could not help admiring the bird ; it showed so much spirit in the fight . it would certainly make a good fighter .
