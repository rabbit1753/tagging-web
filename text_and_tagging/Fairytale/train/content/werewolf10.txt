now it chanced one day , as the king 's daughter was sitting alone in her room , that she thought she would go herself into the forest where the prince had disappeared . she went to her step - mother and begged permission to go out into the forest , in order to forget her surpassing grief . the queen did not want to grant her request , for she always preferred saying no to yes . but the princess begged her so winningly that at last she was unable to say no , and she ordered one of her daughters to go along with her and watch her . that caused a great deal of discussion , for neither of the step - daughters wanted to go with her . each made all sorts of excuses , and asked what pleasures were there in going with the king 's daughter , who did nothing but cry . but the queen had the last word in the end , and ordered that one of her daughters must accompany the princess , even though it be against her will . so the girls wandered out of the castle into the forest . the king 's daughter walked among the trees , and listened to the song of the birds , and thought of her lover , for whom she longed , and who was now no longer there . and the queen 's daughter followed her , vexed , in her malice , with the king 's daughter and her sorrow .
