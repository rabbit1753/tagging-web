once upon a time there was a girl who was to go to the wood and drive the cattle home ; but she did not find the herd , and losing her way instead , came to a great hill . it had gates and doors and she went in . there stood a table covered with all sorts of good things to eat . and there stood a bed as well , and in the bed lay a great snake . the snake said to the girl : " sit down , if you choose ! eat , if you choose ! come and lie down in the bed , if you choose ! but if you do not choose , then do not do so . " so the girl did nothing at all . at last the snake said : " some people are coming now who want you to dance with them . but do not go along with them . " straightway people arrived who wanted to dance with the girl ; but she would hear nothing of it .
