little did he know in his so - called " monkey 's wisdom " that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab 's plan . he purposely pretended not to know who killed his father , and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault . by this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey , which he was meditating . so the monkey returned home from his walk quite content . he told himself he had nothing now to fear . one fine day , when the monkey was sitting at home , he was surprised by the appearance of a messenger from the young crab . while he was wondering what this might mean , the messenger bowed before him and said : " i have been sent by my master to inform you that his father died the other day in falling from a persimmon tree while trying to climb the tree after fruit . this , being the seventh day , is the first anniversary after his death , and my master has prepared a little festival in his father 's honor , and bids you come to participate in it as you were one of his best friends . my master hopes you will honor his house with your kind visit .
