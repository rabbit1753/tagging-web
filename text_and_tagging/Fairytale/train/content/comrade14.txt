" well , well , never mind . i will see whether i can get them back for you , " said his comrade , and went down into the stable . there stood an enormous goat which belonged to the princess , and could fly through the air more swiftly than he could walk on level ground . the comrade took the three - sisters sword , gave him a blow between the horns , and asked : " at what time does the princess ride to meet her lover to - night ? " the goat bleated , and said he did not dare tell . when the comrade had given him another thump , he did say that the princess would come at eleven o'clock sharp . then the comrade put on the three - sisters hat , which made him invisible , and waited for the princess . when she came , she anointed the goat with a salve she carried in a great horn , and cried out : " up , up ! over gable and roof , over land and sea , over hill and dale , to my dearest , who waits for me in the hill !
