but the lad did nothing but grumble and growl , and seemed as sore over his bargain as though he had been trying to trick a jew . what did he want with a lass for a wife who could neither brew nor bake nor boil blue beans ? that is what he said . all the same , they were hitched to the same plough , and there was nothing for it but to pull together the best they could . so off they packed , and the poor princess trudged after him and carried his bundle . so they went on until they came to a poor , mean little hut . there she had to take off her fine clothes and put on rags and tatters ; and that was the way she came home . " well , " said the gooseherd one day , " it 's not the good end of the bargain that i have had in marrying ; all the same , one must make the best one can of a crooked stick when there is none other to be cut in the hedge . it is little or nothing you are fit for ; but here is a basket of eggs , and you shall take them to the market and sell them . " so off the poor princess went to the great town , and stood in the corner of the market with her eggs . by and by there came along a tipsy countryman - tramp ! tramp ! tramp ! as for the basket of eggs , he minded them no more than so many green apples . smash ! and there they lay on the ground , and were fit for nothing but to patch broken promises , as we say in our town . then how the poor princess did wring her hands and cry and cry , for she was afraid to go home to her husband , because of the hard words he would be sure to fling at her . all the same , there was no other place for her to go ; so back she went .
