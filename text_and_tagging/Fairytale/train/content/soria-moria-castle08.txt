it was a long way to the castle , and he hurried and ran in order to get there in good time . toward evening he spied the castle , and it was much handsomer than both the others . this time he felt hardly any fear at all ; but went through the kitchen and right on in . there sat a princess who was extraordinarily beautiful . like the others , she said that no christian soul had ever come to the castle since she had been there , and told him to go away again , as otherwise the troll would swallow him alive , for he had nine heads . " and though he had nine more , and nine on top of those , i will not go , " said halvor , and stood by the stove . the princess earnestly begged him to go , so that the troll would not devour him , but halvor said : " let him come whenever he wishes ! " then she gave him the troll sword , and told him to take a swallow from the bottle , so that he could swing it .
