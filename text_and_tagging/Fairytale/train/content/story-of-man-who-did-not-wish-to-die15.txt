at last , after wandering in an unknown region for many days , he met a hunter . " can you tell me , " asked sentaro , " where the hermits live who have the elixir of life ? " " no . " said the hunter ; " i ca n't tell you where such hermits live . but , there is a notorious robber living in these parts . it is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers . " this odd answer irritated sentaro very much . he thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way . so he decided to go at once to the shrine of jofuku , who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of japan . sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days , entreating jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find .
