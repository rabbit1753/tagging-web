just at this time the fairy of the beech - woods received a visit from an old friend of hers called saradine , who rushed into her house so breathless with rage that she could hardly speak . ' dear , dear ! what is the matter ? ' said the fairy of the beech - woods soothingly . ' the matter ! ' cried saradine . ' you shall soon hear all about it . you know that , not content with endowing celandine , princess of the summer islands , with everything she could desire to make her charming , i actually took the trouble to bring her up myself ; and now what does she do but come to me with more coaxings and caresses than usual to beg a favour . and what do you suppose this favour turns out to be -- when i have been cajoled into promising to grant it ? ' " nothing more nor less than a request that i will take back all my gifts -- since , " says my young madam , " if i have the good fortune to please you , how am i to know that it is really i , myself ? and that 's how it will be all my life long , whenever i meet anybody . you see what a weariness my life will be to me under these circumstances , and yet i assure you i am not ungrateful to you for all your kindness ! " ' i did all i could , ' continued saradine , ' to make her think better of it , but in vain ; so after going through the usual ceremony for taking back my gifts , i 'm come to you for a little peace and quietness . but , after all , i have not taken anything of consequence from this provoking celandine . nature had already made her so pretty , and given her such a ready wit of her own , that she will do perfectly well without me . however , i thought she deserved a little lesson , so to begin with i have whisked her off into the desert , and there left her !
