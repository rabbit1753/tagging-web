" it is time to mount and ride , thomas , " she said , " if thou wouldst ever see the fair castle of ercildoune again . " thomas looked at her in amazement . " thou spokest of seven long years , lady , " he exclaimed , " and i have been here but three days . " the queen smiled . " time passeth quickly in fairy - land , my friend , " she replied . " thou thinkest that thou hast been here but three days . it is seven years since we two met . and now it is time for thee to go . i would fain have had thy presence with me longer , but i dare not , for thine own sake . for every seventh year an evil spirit cometh from the regions of darkness , and carrieth back with him one of our followers , whomsoever he chanceth to choose . and , as thou art a goodly fellow , i fear that he might choose thee . " " so , as i would be loth to let harm befall thee , i will take thee back to thine own country this very night . "
