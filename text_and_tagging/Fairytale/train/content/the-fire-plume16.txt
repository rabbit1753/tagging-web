" you are surprised , " said the old spirit , " to see us disappear when it thunders . the reason is this : that noise which you fancy is thunder , is our enemy the island spirit hallooing on his way home from the hunt . we get out of sight that we may escape the necessity of asking him to come in and share our evening meal . we are not afraid of him , not in the least . " just then it chanced to thunder again , and wassamo observed that his father - in - law made extraordinary dispatch to conceal himself , although no stranger , at all resembling in any way the island spirit , was in view . shortly after this the season of sleep began , and one by one they laid themselves down to the long slumber . the old spirit was the last to drop away ; and , before he yielded , he went forth and had his last sport with the sand - hills , and he so tossed and vexed the poor hills , and scattered them to and fro , and whirled them up in the air , and far over the land , that it was days and days before they got back to any thing like their natural shape . while his relations were enjoying this long sleep , wassamo amused himself as best he could . the cupboard never failed him once : for visit it when he would , he always found a fresh supply of game , and every other dainty which his heart desired .
