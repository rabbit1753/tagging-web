" that , " said the dog , " is our home . we will live here , and you shall rule it as you see fit . " then the maiden laughed amid her tears , and could not overcome her surprise at all she saw . the dog added : " i have but a single request to make to you , and that you must not refuse to grant . " " what is your request ? " asked the princess . " you must promise me , " said the dog , " that you will never look at me while i am asleep : otherwise you are free to do whatever you wish . " the princess gladly promised to grant his request , and so they went to the great castle . and if the castle was magnificent from without , it was still more magnificent within . it was so full of gold and silver that the precious metals gleamed from every corner ; and there was such abundance of supplies of every kind , and of so many other things , that everything in the world one might have wished to have was already there . the princess spent the live - long day running from one room to another , and each was handsomer than the one she had just entered . but when evening came and she went to bed , the dog crept into his own , and then she noticed that he was not a dog ; but a human being . yet she said not a word , because she remembered her promise , and did not wish to cross her husband 's will .
