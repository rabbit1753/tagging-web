so he was brought to a spot surrounded by extensive buildings . he entered , and was greeted by a crowd of boys who were all about fourteen years of age . an old woman came in and they all called out : " this is mother hia ! " and she sat down and had aduan show his tricks . then she taught him the dance of the flying thunders of tsian - tang river , and the music that calms the winds on the sea of dung - ting . when the cymbals and kettledrums reechoed through all the courts , they deafened the ear . then , again , all the courts would fall silent . mother hia thought that aduan would not be able to grasp everything the very first time ; so she taught him with great patience . but aduan had understood everything from the first , and that pleased old mother hia . " this boy , " said she , " equals our own rose of evening ! " the following day the prince of the dragon 's cave held a review of his dancers . when all the dancers had assembled , the dance of the ogres was danced first . those who performed it all wore devil - masks and garments of scales . they beat upon enormous cymbals , and their kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them . their sound was like the sound of a mighty thunder , and the noise was so great that nothing else could be heard . when the dance began , tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies , and then fell down again like star - glimmer which scatters in the air .
