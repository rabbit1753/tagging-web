then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes . but this was no ordinary centipede . this was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature made one creep with horror . hidesato determined to try his last chance . so taking his last arrow and first putting the end of it in his mouth , he fitted the notch to his bow , took careful aim once more and let fly . this time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head , but instead of glancing off harmlessly as before , it struck home to the creature 's brain . then with a convulsive shudder the serpentine body stopped moving , and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day , and then went out in blackness . a great darkness now overspread the heavens , the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed , and the wind roared in fury , and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end . the dragon king and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace , frightened to death , for the building was shaken to its foundation . at last the dreadful night was over . day dawned beautiful and clear . the centipede was gone from the mountain . then hidesato called to the dragon king to come out with him on the balcony , for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear . then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy , and hidesato pointed to the lake . there lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water , which was dyed red with its blood . the gratitude of the dragon king knew no bounds . the whole family came and bowed down before the warrior , calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all japan .
