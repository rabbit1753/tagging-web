' shoot not at me again , ' said he , ' unless you desire death . but lift up my eyebrows , which have fallen over my eyes , that i may see my son - in - law . ' then they arose , and as they did so yspaddaden penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them . and kilweh caught it , and flung it back , and it passed through his eyeball , and came out on the other side of his head . ' a gentle son - in - law , truly ! cursed be the fire in which it was forged and the man who fashioned it ! ' the next day arthur 's men came again to the palace and said : ' shoot not at us any more unless thou desirest more pain than even now thou hast , but give us thy daughter without more words . ' ' where is he that seeks my daughter ? let him come hither so that i may see him . ' and kilweh sat himself in a chair and spoke face to face with him .
