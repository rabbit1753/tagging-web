when the king saw that vision , he rose screaming from his sleep , and donned his arms ; and he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic hosts , but he found no man to answer him . the damsel went forth from the house , and murtough made to follow her , but as he turned the flames leaped out , and all between him and the door was one vast sheet of flame . he saw no way of escape , save the vat of wine that stood in the banqueting hall , and into that he got ; but the burning timbers of the roof fell upon his head and the hails of fiery sparks rained on him , so that half of him was burned and half was drowned , as he had seen in his dream .
