' i hear , ' he said , ' that the old witch on the island has a goat with golden horns from which hang bells that tinkle the sweetest music . that goat i must have ! but , tell me , how am i to get it ? i would give the third part of my kingdom to anyone who would bring it to me . ' ' i will fetch it myself , ' answered pinkel . this time it was easier for pinkel to approach the island unseen , as there was no golden lantern to thrown its beams over the water . but , on the other hand , the goat slept inside the hut , and would therefore have to be taken from under the very eyes of the old woman . how was he to do it ? all the way across the lake he thought and thought , till at length a plan came into his head which seemed as if it might do , though he knew it would be very difficult to carry out .
