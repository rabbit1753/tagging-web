they passed on together a long distance . then , one day , " hark ! " who always ran ahead scouting , came quickly back to his master , and told him he had been near a high mountain , and had heard the king 's second daughter sitting within it winding golden yarn , and that the troll himself was not at home . this was very welcome news for the youth , and he hurried toward the mountain with his faithful dogs . now when they drew near " hark ! " said : " there is no time to lose . the giant is only eight miles away , and i can already hear the golden horse - shoes of his steed ringing on the stones . " the youth at once ordered his dogs to break down the door into the mountain , no matter which way . and when he stepped into the interior of the mountain he saw a lovely maiden sitting in the mountain hall , winding golden yarn on a golden windle . the youth went up and greeted the lovely girl . the king 's daughter was much surprised and said : " who are you that dare to venture into the giant 's hall ? during all the seven years i have been sitting here in the mountain i have never yet seen a human being . " and she added : " for heaven 's sake , hasten away , for if the troll comes your life will be forfeit ! " but the youth told her why he had come , and said that he would await the troll 's return quite undisturbed .
