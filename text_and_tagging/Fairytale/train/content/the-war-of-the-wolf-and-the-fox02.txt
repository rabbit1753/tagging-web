susan was very unhappy when she heard this , and so was the cat , who had been listening to the conversation behind the stove . when simon went off to his work , the poor cat miawed so pitifully , and looked up so pathetically into susan 's face , that the woman quickly opened the door . she said , ' fly for your life , my poor little beast , and get well away from here before your master returns . ' the cat took her advice , and ran as quickly as her poor old legs would carry her into the wood . when simon came home , his wife told him that the cat had vanished .
