when the dreams had sung their song they skipped away , and nukku matti carried lasse back to the boat . he lay there for a long time quite still , and he still heard the frying - pan frizzling at home of the fire , the frizzling was very plain , little lasse heard it quite near him ; and so he woke up and rubbed his eyes . there he lay in the boat , where he had fallen asleep . the wind had turned , and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with another while little lasse slept , and what lasse thought was frizzling in a frying - pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against the stones on the shore . but he was not altogether wrong , for the clear blue sea is like a great pan in which god 's sun all day makes cakes for good children . little lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him . everything was the same as before ; the crow in the birch tree , the cat on the grass , and the pea - shell fleet on the shore . some of the ships had foundered , and some had drifted back to land . hercules had come back with its cargo from asia , the flea had arrived from polynesia , and the other parts of the world were just where they were before . little lasse did not know what to think . he had so often been in that grotto in the ' land of nod ' and did not know what tricks dreams can play . but little lasse did not trouble his head with such things ; he gathered together his boats and walked up the shore back to the house .
