oh , yes , it was for sale , and cheap at that ; the princess should have it for the kerchief which she wore about her neck . prut ! but the lad was a saucy one ; that was what the princess said . but , after all , a kerchief was only a kerchief ; fetch the gooseherd over and she would give it to him , for she wanted the pretty golden ball for her own , and she would have it if it were to be had . but , no ; the gooseherd would not come at the princess 's bidding . if she wanted to buy the golden ball she must come up on the hill and pay him , for he was not going to leave his flock of geese , and have them waddling into the garden perhaps ; that is what the gooseherd said . so the upshot of the matter was that the princess went out with her women , and gave the lad the kerchief up on the hill behind the hedge , and brought back the golden ball with her for her own .
