in byegone days , in an old farmhouse which stood by a river , there lived a beautiful girl called maisie . she was tall and straight , with auburn hair and blue eyes , and she was the prettiest girl in all the valley . and one would have thought that she would have been the pride of her mother 's heart . but , instead of this , her mother used to sigh and shake her head whenever she looked at her . and why ? because , in those days , all men were sensible ; and instead of looking out for pretty girls to be their wives , they looked out for girls who could cook and spin , and who gave promise of becoming notable housewives .
