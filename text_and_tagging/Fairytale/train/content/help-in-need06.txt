the goddess said : " for hundreds of years my family has been living in the depth of the eastern sea . but we were unfortunate in that our treasures excited the jealousy of men . the ancestor of pi - lo nearly destroyed our entire clan by fire . my ancestors had to fly and hide themselves . and not long ago , our enemy pi - lo himself wanted to deliver an imperial letter in the cave of the sea of dungting . under the pretext of begging for pearls and treasures , he wished to enter the dragon - castle and destroy our family . fortunately a wise man saw through his treacherous purpose , and lo - dsi - tschun and his brothers were sent in his stead . yet my people did not feel safe from future attacks . for this reason they withdrew to the distant west . my father has done much good to mankind and hence is highly honored there . i am his ninth daughter . when i was sixteen i was wedded to the youngest son of the rock - dragon . but my good husband had a fiery temper , which often caused him to offend against the laws of courtesy , and in less than a year 's time the punishment of heaven was his portion . i was left alone and returned to the home of my parents .
