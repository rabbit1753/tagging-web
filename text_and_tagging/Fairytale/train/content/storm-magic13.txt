when the day came on which the cabin - boy was to take command , the weather was fair and quiet ; but he drummed up the whole ship 's crew , and with the exception of a tiny bit of canvas , had all sails reefed . the captain and crew laughed at him , and said : " that shows the sort of a captain we have now . do n't you want us to reef that last bit of sail this very minute ? " " not yet , " answered the cabin - boy , " but before long . " suddenly a squall struck them , struck them so heavily that they thought they would capsize , and had they not reefed the sails they would undoubtedly have foundered when the first breaker roared down upon the ship .
