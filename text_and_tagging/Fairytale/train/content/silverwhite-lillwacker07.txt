seven years had passed , and the king was expected home from the war . then both girls were terrified , and they took counsel together as to how they might hide their children . when at length they could find no other way out of the difficulty , they very sorrowfully bade their children farewell . they let them down from the tower at night , to seek their fortune in the wide , wide world . at parting the king 's daughter gave silverwhite a costly knife . the maid had nothing to give her son .
