now the old lady fell ill , and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again . she had to be nursed and waited upon , and this was no one 's duty more than karen 's . but there was a grand ball in the town , and karen was invited . she looked at the red shoes , saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that ; she put the red shoes on , thinking there was no harm in that either ; and then she went to the ball ; and commenced to dance . but when she wanted to go to the right , the shoes danced to the left , and when she wanted to dance up the room , the shoes danced down the room , down the stairs through the street , and out through the gates of the town . she danced , and was obliged to dance , far out into the dark wood . suddenly something shone up among the trees , and she believed it was the moon , for it was a face . but it was the old soldier with the red beard ; he sat there nodding his head and said : " dear me , what pretty dancing shoes ! " she was frightened , and wanted to throw the red shoes away ; but they stuck fast . she tore off her stockings , but the shoes had grown fast to her feet . she danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow , in rain and sunshine , by night and by day -- but by night it was most horrible . she danced out into the open churchyard ; but the dead there did not dance . they had something better to do than that . she wanted to sit down on the pauper 's grave where the bitter fern grows ; but for her there was neither peace nor rest . and as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes , with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth ; his face was stern and grave , and in his hand he held a broad shining sword .
