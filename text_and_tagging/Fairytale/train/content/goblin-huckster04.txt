this was a very rude speech , especially against the cask , but the huckster and the student both laughed , for it was only said in fun . the goblin , however , felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter . as soon as it was night , the shop closed , and every one in bed except the student , the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster 's wife slept , and took away her tongue , which of course she did not then want . whatever object in the room he placed this tongue upon , immediately received voice and speech and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do . it could only be used by one object at a time , which was a good thing , as a number speaking at once would have caused great confusion . the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask , in which lay a quantity of old newspapers .
