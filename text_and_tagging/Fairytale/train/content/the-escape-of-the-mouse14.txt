' to - morrow i will reap this , ' said he . on the morrow when he went to reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw . filled with dismay he hastened to the second field . there the corn was ripe and golden . ' to - morrow i will reap this , ' he said . on the morrow the ears had gone , and there was nothing but the bare straw . ' well , there is still one field left , ' he said , and when he looked at it , it was still fairer than the other two . ' to - night i will watch here , ' thought he . ' whosoever carried off the other corn will in like manner take this . i will know who it is . ' so he hid himself and waited .
