all this said the teapot in its fresh young life . it stood on the table that was spread for tea ; it was lifted by a very delicate hand , but the delicate hand was awkward . the teapot fell , the spout snapped off , and the handle snapped off . the lid was no worse to speak of ; the worst had been spoken of that . the teapot lay in a swoon on the floor , while the boiling water ran out of it . it was a horrid shame , but the worst was that everybody jeered at it ; they jeered at the teapot and not at the awkward hand . " i never shall forget that experience , " said the teapot , when it afterward talked of its life . " i was called an invalid , and placed in a corner , and the next day was given to a woman who begged for victuals . i fell into poverty , and stood dumb both outside and in . but then , just as i was , began my better life . one can be one thing and still become quite another .
