well , we had everything of the best , and plenty of it ; and we ate , and we drank , and we danced , and the young master , by the same token , danced with peggy barry , from the bohereen -- a lovely young couple they were , though they are both low enough now . to make a long story short , i got , as a body may say , the same thing as tipsy almost , for i ca n't remember , ever at all , no ways , how it was i left the place ; only i did leave it , that 's certain . well , i thought , for all that , in myself , i 'd just step to molly cronohan 's , the fairy woman , to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched ; and so , as i was crossing the stepping - stones of the ford of ballyashenogh , and was looking up at the stars , an blessing myself -- for why ? it was lady - day -- i missed my foot , and souse i fell into the water . ' death alive ! ' thought i , ' i 'll be drowned now ! ' however , i began swimming , swimming , swimming away for dear life , till at last i got ashore , somehow or other , but never the one of me can tell how , upon a dissolute island .
