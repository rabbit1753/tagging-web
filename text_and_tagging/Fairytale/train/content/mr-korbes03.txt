then there came up a millstone , then an egg , then a duck , then a pin , and lastly a needle , who all got up on the carriage , and were driven along . but when they came to mr . korbes 's house he was not at home . so the mice drew the carriage into the barn , the cock and the hen flew up and perched on a beam , the cat sat by the fireside , the duck settled on the water ; but the egg wrapped itself in the towel , the pin stuck itself in the chair cushion , the needle jumped into the bed among the pillows , and the millstone laid itself by the door .
