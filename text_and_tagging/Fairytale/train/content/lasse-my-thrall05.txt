now matters were arranged to suit him , and he was quite content as he turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes . but the room he had slept in was not the end of his magnificence . when he woke the following morning and looked around , he saw that he had been sleeping in a great castle . there was one room after another , and wherever he went walls and ceilings were covered with ornaments and decorations of every kind , all glittering so splendidly when the rays of the sun fell on them that he had to put his hand to his eyes ; for wherever he looked everything sparkled with gold and silver . then he glanced out of the window and first began to realize how really beautiful everything was . gone were the fir - trees and juniper bushes , and in their place showed the loveliest garden one might wish to see , filled with beautiful trees and roses of every variety , in bush and tree form . but there was not a human being in sight , not even a cat . yet he found it quite natural that everything should be so fine , and that he should once more have become a great lord .
