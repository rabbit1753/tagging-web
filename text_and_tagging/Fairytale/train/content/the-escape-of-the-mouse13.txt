' to - morrow i will reap this , ' said he . on the morrow when he went to reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw . filled with dismay he hastened to the second field . there the corn was ripe and golden . ' to - morrow i will reap this , ' he said . on the morrow the ears had gone , and there was nothing but the bare straw . ' well , there is still one field left , ' he said , and when he looked at it , it was still fairer than the other two . ' to - night i will watch here , ' thought he . ' whosoever carried off the other corn will in like manner take this . i will know who it is . ' so he hid himself and waited . the hours slid by , and all was still , so still that manawyddan well - nigh dropped asleep . but at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the world , and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice , which could neither be numbered nor measured . each mouse climbed up a straw till it bent down with its weight . then it bit off one of the ears , and carried it away . there was not one of the straws that had not got a mouse to it . full of wrath he rushed at the mice . he could no more come up with them than if they had been gnats , or birds of the air , save one only which lingered behind the rest , and this mouse manawyddan came up with . stooping down he seized it by the tail , and put it in his glove , and tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove , so that the mouse could not escape . when he entered the hall where kieva was sitting , he lighted a fire , and hung the glove up on a peg .
