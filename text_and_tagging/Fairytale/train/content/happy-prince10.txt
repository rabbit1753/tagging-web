" in the square below , " said the happy prince , " there stands a little match - girl . she has let her matches fall in the gutter , and they are all spoiled . her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money , and she is crying . she has no shoes or stockings , and her little head is bare . pluck out my other eye , and give it to her , and her father will not beat her . " " i will stay with you one night longer , " said the swallow , " but i can not pluck out your eye . you would be quite blind then . " " swallow , swallow , little swallow , " said the prince , " do as i command you . " so he plucked out the prince 's other eye , and darted down with it . he swooped past the match - girl , and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand . " what a lovely bit of glass , " cried the little girl ; and she ran home , laughing . then the swallow came back to the prince . " you are blind now , " he said , " so i will stay with you always . " " no , little swallow , " said the poor prince , " you must go away to egypt . " " i will stay with you always , " said the swallow , and he slept at the prince 's feet .
