now when they had already covered a good bit of the homeward road , they passed close to a steep cliff - side where the giants dwelt . and a giant came out , looked at them , and turned them all to stone , princes and princesses . the king waited and waited for his six sons . though he waited and yearned , they did not come . then he grew very sad , and said that he would never really be happy again . " if i did not have you , " he told his youngest , " i would not keep on living , so sad am i at having lost your brothers . " " but i had already been thinking of asking your permission to set out and find my brothers again , " said the youngest . " no , that i will not allow under any circumstances , " answered the father , " otherwise you will be lost to me into the bargain . " but the youth 's mind was set on going , and he pleaded so long that finally the king had to let him have his way . now the king had only a wretched old nag for him , since the six other princes and their suite had been given all the good horses . that did not worry the youngest . he mounted the shabby old nag , and " farewell , father ! " he said to the king . " i will surely return , and perhaps i will bring my six brothers back with me . " and with that he rode off .
