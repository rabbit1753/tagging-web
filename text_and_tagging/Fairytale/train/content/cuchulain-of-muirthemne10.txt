in the long time ago , conchubar , son of ness , was king of ulster , and he held his court in the palace of emain macha . and this is the way he came to be king . he was but a young lad , and his father was not living . fergus , son of rogh , who was at that time king of ulster , asked his mother ness in marriage . now ness , that was at one time the quietest and kindest of the women of ireland , had got to be unkind and treacherous because of an unkindness that had been done to her . she planned to get the kingdom away from fergus for her own son . so she said to fergus , " let conchubar hold the kingdom for a year , so that his children after him may be called the children of a king . that is the marriage portion i will ask of you . " " you may do that , " the men of ulster said to him . " for even though conchubar gets the name of being king , it is yourself that will be our king all the time . " so fergus agreed to it , and he took ness as his wife , and her son conchubar was made king in his place .
