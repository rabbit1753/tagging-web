he wanted to take her with him to his kingdom , but she begged him just to let her go once more to her father ; and the prince let her go , but told her not to say more than three words to her father , then to come back again . so she went home , but alas ! she said more than three words ; and immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a mountain of glass and sharp swords . but the prince was free , and was no longer shut up in it . then she said good - bye to her father , and took a little money with her , and went again into the great wood to look for the iron stove ; but she could not find it . she sought it for nine days , and then her hunger became so great that she did not know how she could live any longer . and when it was evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the night would not come , because she was afraid of the wild beasts .
