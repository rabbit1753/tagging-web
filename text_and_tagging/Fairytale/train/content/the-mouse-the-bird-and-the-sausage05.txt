the bird then very sadly took up the wood and carried it home himself , and related to the mouse all he had seen and heard . they were both very troubled , but determined to look on the bright side of things , and still to remain together . and so the bird laid the cloth , and the mouse prepared the food , and finally got into the pot , as the sausage used to do , to stir and flavour the broth , but then she had to part with fur and skin , and lastly with life !
