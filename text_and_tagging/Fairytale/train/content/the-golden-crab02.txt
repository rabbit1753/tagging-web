she turned round in surprise , and then she saw the little creature , the golden crab . ' what ! you can speak , can you , you ridiculous crab ? ' she said , for she was not quite pleased at the crab 's remarks . then she took him up and placed him on a dish . when her husband came home and they sat down to dinner , they presently heard the crab 's little voice saying , ' give me some too . ' they were all very much surprised , but they gave him something to eat . when the old man came to take away the plate which had contained the crab 's dinner , he found it full of gold , and as the same thing happened every day he soon became very fond of the crab . one day the crab said to the fisherman 's wife , ' go to the king and tell him i wish to marry his younger daughter .
