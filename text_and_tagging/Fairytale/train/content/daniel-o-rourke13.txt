the ould gander , who was their general , turning about his head , cried out to me , ' is that you , dan ? ' ' the same , ' said i , not a bit daunted now at what he said , for i was by this time used to all kinds of bedivilment , and , besides , i knew him of ould . ' good morrow to you , ' says he , ' daniel o'rourke ; how are you in health this morning ? ' ' very well , sir , ' says i , ' thank you kindly , ' drawing my breath , for i was mightily in want of some , ' i hope your honour 's the same . ' ' i think it is falling you are , daniel , ' says he . ' you may say that , sir , ' says i. ' and where are you going all the way so fast ? ' said the gander . so i told him how i had taken the drop , and how i came on the island , and how i lost my way in the bog , and how the thief of an eagle flew me up to the moon , and how the man in the moon turned me out . ' dan , ' said he , ' i 'll save you ; put out your hand and catch me by the leg , and i 'll fly you home . ' ' sweet is your hand in a pitcher of honey , my jewel , ' says i , though all the time i thought within myself that i do n't much trust you ; but there was no help , so i caught the gander by the leg , and away i and the other geese flew after him as fast as hops .
