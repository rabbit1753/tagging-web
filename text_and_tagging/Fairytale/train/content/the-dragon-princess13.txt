in the castle there was a dragon who was over a thousand years old . he could turn himself into a human being , and could interpret the language of human beings . through him the dragon 's daughter learned that the emperor was sending her the gifts , and she returned them with a gift of three great pearls , seven smaller pearls and a whole bushel of ordinary pearls . the messengers took leave , rode off with their pearls on a dragon 's back , and in a moment they had reached the banks of the yangtze - kiang . they made their way to nanking , the imperial capital , and there handed over their treasure of gems . the emperor was much pleased and showed them to the wise man . he said : " of the three great pearls one is a divine wishing - pearl of the third class , and two are black dragon - pearls of medium quality . of the seven smaller pearls two are serpent - pearls , and five are mussel - pearls . the remaining pearls are in part sea - crane pearls , in part snail and oyster - pearls . they do not approach the great pearls in value , and yet few will be found to equal them on earth . " the emperor also showed them to all his servants . they , however , thought the wise man 's words all talk , and did not believe what he said .
