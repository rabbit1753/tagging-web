there seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage , as she was coming in at the front door . " i trust that is not that pie : the spoons are locked up , however , " said ribby . but there was nobody there . ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty , and turned the pie . there began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse ! duchess in the meantime , had slipped out at the back door . " it is a very odd thing that ribby 's pie was not in the oven when i put mine in ! and i can t find it anywhere ; i have looked all over the house . i put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top . i could not turn any of the other handles ; i think that they are all shams , " said duchess , " but i wish i could have removed the pie made of mouse ! i can not think what she has done with it ? i heard ribby coming and i had to run out by the back door !
