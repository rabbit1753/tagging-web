" naubesah , you little fool , " said the mother , " mind your bow and arrows , and do not be afraid to enter the forest in search of birds and squirrels , with your little brother . it is not manly to be ever about the lodge . nor will you become a warrior if you tell all the little things that you see and hear to your father . say not a word to him . " the boys obeyed , but as they grew older and still noticed the visits of the stranger , they resolved to speak again to their mother . they now told her that they meant to make known to their father all that they had witnessed , for they frequently saw this young man passing through the woods , and he did not walk in the path , nor did he carry any thing to eat . if he had any message to deliver at their lodge , why did he not give it to their father ? for they had observed that messages were always addressed to men , and not to women . when her sons spoke thus to her , the mother was greatly vexed . " i will kill you , " she said , " if you speak of it . "
