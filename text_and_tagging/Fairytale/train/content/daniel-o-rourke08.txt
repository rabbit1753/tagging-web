' if you do n't , my man , i shall just give you a shake , and one slap of my wing , and send you down to the ground , where every bone in your body will be smashed as small as a drop of dew on a cabbage - leaf in the morning . ' ' why , then , i 'm in a fine way , ' said i to myself , ' ever to have come along with the likes of you ' ; and so , giving him a hearty curse in irish , for fear he 'd know what i said , i got off his back with a heavy heart , took hold of the reaping - hook and sat down upon the moon , and a mighty cold seat it was , i can tell you that . when he had me there fairly landed , he turned about on me , and said , ' good morning to you , daniel o'rourke , ' said he ; ' i think i 've nicked you fairly now . you robbed my nest last year ' ( it was true enough for him , but how he found it out is hard enough to say ) , ' and in return you are freely welcome to cool your heels dangling upon the moon like a cockthrow .
