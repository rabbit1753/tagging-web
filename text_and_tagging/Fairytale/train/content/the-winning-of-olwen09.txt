' i am not come , ' replied kilweh , ' for meat and drink , but to obtain a boon , and if you grant it me i will pay it back , and will carry thy praise to the four winds of heaven . but if you wilt not grant it to me , then i will proclaim your discourtesy wherever your name is known . ' ' what you ask that shall you receive , ' said arthur , ' as far as the wind dries and the rain moistens , and the sun revolves and the sea encircles and the earth extends . save only my ship and my mantle , my word and my lance , my shield and my dagger , and guinevere my wife . ' ' i would that you bless my hair , ' spake kilweh , and arthur answered : ' that shall be granted to you . '
