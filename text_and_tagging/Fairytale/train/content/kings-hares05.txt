then , after some time had passed , the youngest decided to set out to herd the king 's hares , and told his father of his intention . he thought that would be just the work for him , to loaf about in forest and field , look for strawberry patches , herd a flock of hares , and lie down and sleep in the sun between times . his father thought that there was other work that would suit him better , and that even if he fared no worse than his brothers , it was quite certain that he would fare no better . whoever herded the king 's hares must not drag along as though he had lead in his soles , or like a fly on a limerod . and that when the hares took to their heels , it was a horse of another color from catching flees with gloved hands . whoever wanted to escape with a whole back , would have to be more than quick and nimble , and swifter than a bird . but there was nothing he could do . esben merely kept on saying that he wanted to go to court and serve the king , for he would not take service with any lesser master , said he . and he would see to the hares , they could not be much worse than a herd of goats or of calves . and with that he took his knapsack and strolled comfortably down the hill .
