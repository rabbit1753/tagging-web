thus kintaro 's fate was settled , and the general decided to start for the capital at once , taking kintaro with him . it need hardly be said that yama - uba was sad at parting with her boy , for he was all that was left to her . but she hid her grief with a strong face . she knew that it was for her boy 's good that he should leave her now . she must not discourage him just as he was setting out . kintaro promised never to forget her , and said that as soon as he was a knight wearing two swords he would build her a home and take care of her in her old age . all the animals , those he had tamed to serve him , the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare , as soon as they found out that he was going away , came to ask if they might attend him as usual . when they learned that he was going away for good they followed him to the foot of the mountain to see him off .
