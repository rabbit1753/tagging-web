" give me a little bit of pancake , mother , i 'm so hungry ! " said one of the children . " dear mother ! " said the second . " dear , sweet mother ! " said the third . " dear , sweet , good mother ! " said the fourth . " dear , best , sweet , good mother ! " said the fifth . " dear , best , sweet , good , dearest mother ! " said the sixth . " dear , best , sweet , good , dearest , sweetest mother ! " said the seventh , and so they all begged around the pancake , one more sweetly than the other , for they were all so hungry and so well - behaved . " yes , children , wait until it turns around , " said she -- until i have turned it around , she should have said--"then you shall all have a pancake , a lovely best - milk pancake . just see how fat and comfortable it is lying there !
