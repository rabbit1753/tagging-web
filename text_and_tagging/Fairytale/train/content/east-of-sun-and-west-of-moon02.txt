now it happened that one thursday evening late in the fall there was a terrible storm raging outside . it was pitch dark , and it rained and stormed so that the house shook in every joint . the whole family sat around the hearth , and each was busy with some work or other . suddenly there were three loud knocks on the window - pane . the man went out to see who was there . when he stepped outside , there stood a great white bear .
