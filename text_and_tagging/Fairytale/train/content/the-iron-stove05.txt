and a little toad came forward and let her in . when she entered they all bid her welcome , and made her sit down . they asked her how she came there and what she wanted . then she told everything that had happened to her , and how , because she had exceeded her permission only to speak three words , the stove had disappeared with the prince ; and how she had searched a very long time , and must wander over mountain and valley till she found him . then the old toad said : ' little green toad whose leg doth twist , go to the corner of which you wist , and bring to me the large old kist .
