" sit down yourself ! " answered the man . then she had to sit down and remain seated , for the chair had power to hold fast all that approached it . in the meantime they wandered about in the hill , and the comrade kept looking around until he saw a sword that hung above the door . this he wanted to have , and he promised the witch that he would release her from her chair if she would let him have the sword . " no , " she cried , " ask what you will . you can have anything else , but not that , for that is my three - sisters sword ! " ( there were three sisters to whom the sword belonged in common . ) " then you may sit where you are till the world 's end ! " said the man . and when she heard that she promised to let him have the sword , if he would release her . so he took the sword , and went away with it ; but he left her sitting there , after all . when they had wandered far , over stony wastes and desolate heaths , they again came to a wall of rock . there the comrade again knocked , and begged to be let in . just as before , the rock opened , and when they had gone far into the hill , a witch came to meet them with a chair and bade them be seated , " for you must be tired , " said she .
