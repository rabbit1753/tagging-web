then thomas took courage , and looked up ; and lo , they were riding through a beautiful orchard , where apples and pears , dates and figs and wine - berries grew in great abundance . and his tongue was so parched and dry , and he felt so faint , that he longed for some of the fruit to restore him . he stretched out his hand to pluck some of it ; but his companion turned in her saddle and forbade him . " there is nothing safe for thee to eat here , " she said , " save an apple , which i will give thee presently . if thou touch aught else thou art bound to remain in fairy - land for ever . " so poor thomas had to restrain himself as best he could ; and they rode slowly on , until they came to a tiny tree all covered with red apples . the fairy queen bent down and plucked one , and handed it to her companion .
