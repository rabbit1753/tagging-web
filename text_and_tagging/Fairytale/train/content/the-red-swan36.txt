one day the two brothers began to look dark upon maidwa , and to reproach him for having taken from the medicine - sack their deceased father 's magic arrows ; they upbraided him especially that one was lost . after listening to them in silence , he said that he would go in search of it , and that it should be restored ; and the very next day , true to his word , he left them . after traveling a long way , and looking in every direction , almost hopeless of discovering the lost treasure , he came to an opening in the earth , and descending , it led him to the abode of departed spirits . the country appeared beautiful , the pastures were greener than his own , and the sky bluer than that which hung over the lodge , and the extent of it was utterly lost in a dim distance ; and he saw animals of every kind wandering about in great numbers . the first he came to were buffalos ; his surprise was great when they addressed him as human beings . they asked him what he came for , how he had descended , and why he was so bold as to visit the abode of the dead . he answered that he was in quest of a magic arrow , to appease the anger of his brothers .
