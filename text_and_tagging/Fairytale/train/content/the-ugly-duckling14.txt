it really delighted him now to think of all the hardships and adversities he had suffered , now he could rightly discern his good fortune and all the beauty that greeted him . the great swans swam round him and caressed him with their bills . some little children now came into the garden and threw bread and corn into the water , and the smallest of them cried : " there 's a new one ! " and the others called out in delight : " yes , there 's a new one come ! " they clapped their hands and danced about and ran to their father and mother . more bread and cake was thrown into the water , and everyone said : " the new one is the handsomest of all ; how young and beautiful he is ! " and the elder swans bowed before him .
