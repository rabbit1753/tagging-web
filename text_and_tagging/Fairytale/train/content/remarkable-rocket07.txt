then a little frog , with bright jewelled eyes , and a green mottled coat , swam up to him . " a new arrival , i see ! " said the frog . " well , after all there is nothing like mud . give me rainy weather and a ditch , and i am quite happy . do you think it will be a wet afternoon ? i am sure i hope so , but the sky is quite blue and cloudless . what a pity ! " " ahem ! ahem ! " said the rocket , and he began to cough . " what a delightful voice you have ! " cried the frog . " really it is quite like a croak , and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world . you will hear our glee - club this evening . we sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer 's house , and as soon as the moon rises we begin . it is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us . in fact , it was only yesterday that i heard the farmer 's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us . it is most gratifying to find oneself so popular .
