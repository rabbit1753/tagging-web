cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye , and he flew over a stile and away . lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little - town -- a hill that goes up -- up -- into the clouds as though it had no top ! and a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass . lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her ; she ran along a steep path - way -- up and up -- until little - town was right away down below -- she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney ! presently she came to a spring , bubbling out from the hill - side .
