" oh , it 's nothing but the truth you have . " the king did not allow me to be tied any more . he said there was nothing so much to wonder at as that i cut the hand off , and i tied . the child was growing till he was a year old , and he was beginning to walk , and there was no one caring for him more than i was . he was growing till he was three , and he was running out every minute . so the king ordered a silver chain to be put between me and the child , so that he might not go away from me . i was out with him in the garden every day , and the king was as proud as the world of the child . he would be watching him every place we went , till the child grew so wise that he would loose the chain and get off . but one day that he loosed it i failed to find him . i ran into the house and searched the house , but there was no getting him for me . the king cried to go out and find the child , that he had got loose from the dog . they went searching for him , but they could not find him . when they failed altogether to find him , there remained no more favour with the king towards me , and everyone disliked me , and i grew weak , for i did not get a morsel to eat half the time . when summer came i said i would try and go home to my own country . i went away one fine morning , and i went swimming , and god helped me till i came home . i went into the garden , for i knew there was a place in the garden where i could hide myself , for fear she should see me . in the morning i saw my wife out walking , and my child with her , held by the hand . i pushed out to see the child , and , as he was looking about him everywhere , he saw me , and called out , " i see my shaggy papa . oh , " said he ; " oh , my heart 's love , my shaggy papa , come here till i see you .
