day by day , these strange communings with unseen beings drew away the heart of leelinau more and more from the simple duties of the lodge , and she walked among her people , melancholy and silent , like a spirit who had visited them from another land . the pastimes which engaged the frolic moments of her young companions , passed by her as little trivial pageants in which she had no concern . when the girls of the neighboring lodges assembled to play at the favorite female game of pappus - e - ko - waun , or the block and string , before the lodge - door , leelinau would sit vacantly by , or enter so feebly into the spirit of the play as to show that it was irksome to her .
