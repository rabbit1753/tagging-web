sentaro obeyed wonderingly . the crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort . it then spread its wings , rose high in the air , and flew away over the mountains right out to sea . sentaro was at first quite frightened . by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air . on and on they went for thousands of miles . the bird never stopped for rest or food , but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment , and strange to say , neither did sentaro . after several days they reached an island . the crane flew some distance inland and then alighted . as years went by , however , things did not go as smoothly as at first . he had heavy losses in business , and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors . this caused him great annoyance . time passed like the flight of an arrow for him , for he was busy from morning till night . three hundred years went by in this monotonous way . then at last he began to grow tired of life in this country , and he longed to see his own land and his old home . however long he lived here , life would always be the same , so was it not foolish and wearisome to stay on here forever ?
