but before he had opened his wings , a third drop fell , and he looked up , and saw - ah ! what did he see ? the eyes of the happy prince were filled with tears , and tears were running down his golden cheeks . his face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little swallow was filled with pity . " who are you ? " he said . " i am the happy prince . " " why are you weeping then ? " asked the swallow ; " you have quite drenched me . " " when i was alive and had a human heart , " answered the statue , " i did not know what tears were , for i lived in the palace of sans - souci , where sorrow is not allowed to enter . in the daytime i played with my companions in the garden , and in the evening i led the dance in the great hall . round the garden ran a very lofty wall , but i never cared to ask what lay beyond it , everything about me was so beautiful . my courtiers called me the happy prince , and happy indeed i was , if pleasure be happiness . so i lived , and so i died . and now that i am dead they have set me up here so high that i can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city , and though my heart is made of lead yet i can not chose but weep .
