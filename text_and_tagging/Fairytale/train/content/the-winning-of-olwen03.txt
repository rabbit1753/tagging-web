one day when the king was out hunting he rode past the place where the queen lay buried , and there he saw a briar growing with two blossoms on it . ' it is time that i took a wife , ' said he , and after long looking he found one . but he did not tell her about his son ; indeed he hardly remembered that he had one till she heard it at last from an old woman whom she had gone to visit . and the new queen was very pleased , and sent messengers to fetch the boy , and in his father 's court he stayed , while the years went by till one day the queen told him that a prophecy had foretold that he was to win for his wife olwen the daughter of yspaddaden penkawr .
