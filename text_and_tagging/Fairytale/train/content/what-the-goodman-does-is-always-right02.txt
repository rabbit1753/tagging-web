i have no doubt that you have been in the country and seen a very old farmhouse , with thatched roof , and mosses and small plants growing wild upon it . there is a stork 's nest on the ridge of the gable , for we can not do without the stork . the walls of the house are sloping , and the windows are low , and only one of the latter is made to open . the baking oven sticks out of the wall like a great knob . an elder tree hangs over the palings , and beneath its branches , at the foot of the paling , is a pool of water in which a few ducks are sporting . there is a yard dog , too , that barks at all comers .
