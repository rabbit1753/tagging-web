they were about to thrust the couch into the stream . the girl 's parents said farewell to her amid tears . but si - men bade them wait . he said : " do not be in such a hurry ! i have appeared in person to escort the bride , hence everything must be done solemnly and in order . first some one must go to the river - god 's castle . let him know that he may come himself and fetch his bride . " and with these words he looked at a witch . he said : " you may go ! " the witch hesitated , but he ordered his servants to seize her and thrust her into the stream . after which about an hour went by . " that woman did not understand her business , " continued si - men , " or else she would have been back long ago ! " and with that he looked at one of the sorcerers . he added : " do you go and do better ! " the sorcerer paled with fear , but si - men had him seized and cast into the river . again half - an - hour went by .
