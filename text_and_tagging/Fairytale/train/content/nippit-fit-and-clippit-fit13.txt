alas ! alas ! pride must have a fall . for the cavalcade had not proceeded very far when a little bird which was perched on a branch of a bush by the roadside sang out : " nippit fit , and clippit fit , behind the king rides , but pretty fit , and little fit , ahint the caldron hides . " " what is this that the birdie says ? " cried the prince , who , if the truth be told , did not feel altogether satisfied with the bride whom fortune had bestowed upon him . " do you have another sister , madam ? " " only a little one , " murmured the lady , who liked ill the way in which things seemed to be falling out . " we will go back and find her , " said the prince firmly , " for when i sent out the slipper i had no mind that its wearer should nip her foot , and clip her foot , in order to get it on . " so the whole party turned back ; and when they reached the laird 's house the prince ordered a search to be made in the courtyard . and the bonnie little sister was soon discovered and brought out , all blushes and confusion , from her hiding - place behind the caldron . " give her the slipper , and let her try it on , " said the prince , and the eldest sister was forced to obey . and what was the horror of the bystanders , as she drew it off , to see that she had cut off the tops of her toes in order to get it on . but it fitted her little sister 's foot exactly , without either paring or clipping ; and when the prince saw that it was so , he lifted the elder sister down from his horse and lifted the little one up in her place , and carried her home to his palace , where the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing ; and for the rest of their lives they were the happiest couple in the whole kingdom .
