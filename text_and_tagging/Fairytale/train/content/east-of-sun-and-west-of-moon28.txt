" o , yes , i know very well where the castle lies , " said the north wind . " i blew an aspen leaf there just once , and then i was so weary that i could not blow at all for many a long day . but if you want to get there above all things , and are not afraid of me , i will take you on my back , and see whether i can blow you there . " the maiden said that she must and would get to the castle , if it were by any means possible . she was not afraid , no matter how hard the journey might be . " very well , then you must stay here over night , " said the north wind . " for if we are to get there to - morrow , we must have the whole day before us . " early the next morning the north wind awakened the maiden . then he blew himself up , and made himself so large and thick that he was quite horrible to look at . thereupon they rushed along through the air as though they meant to reach the end of the world at once . and everywhere beneath them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out by the roots , and houses torn down . as they rushed across the sea , ships foundered by the hundreds . further and further they went , so far that no one could even imagine it , and still they were flying across the sea . gradually the north wind grew weary , and became weaker and weaker . finally he could hardly keep going , and sank lower and lower . at last he flew so low that the waves washed his ankles .
