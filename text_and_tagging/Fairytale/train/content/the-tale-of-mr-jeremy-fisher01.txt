" i know a good place for minnows , " said mr . jeremy fisher . mr . jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it . then he settled himself cross - legged and arranged his fishing tackle . he had the dearest little red float . his rod was a tough stalk of grass , his line was a fine long white horse - hair , and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end .
