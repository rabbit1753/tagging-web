once upon a time there lived a monk at puto who was exceedingly learned . an aged man had led him into the cave in question , where he had seen a number of volumes on the book stands . the aged man had said : " these are the histories of the various dynasties . " in a second room were to be found the histories of all the peoples on earth . a third was guarded by two dogs . the aged man explained : " in this room are kept the secret reports of the immortals , telling the arts by means of which they gained eternal life . the two dogs are two dragons . " the monk turned the pages of the books , and found that they were all works of ancient times , such as he had never seen before . he would gladly have remained in the cave , but the old man said : " that would not do ! " and a boy led him out again . the name of that cave , however , was the coral ring , and it was described in the volume which lay on the table .
