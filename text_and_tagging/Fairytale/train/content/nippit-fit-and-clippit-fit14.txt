" do you have another sister , madam ? " " only a little one , " murmured the lady , who liked ill the way in which things seemed to be falling out . " we will go back and find her , " said the prince firmly , " for when i sent out the slipper i had no mind that its wearer should nip her foot , and clip her foot , in order to get it on . "
