duchess read the letter and wrote an answer:--"i will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four . but it is very strange . _ i _ was just going to invite you to come here , to supper , my dear ribby , to eat something most delicious . " " i will come very punctually , my dear ribby , " wrote duchess ; and then at the end she added--"i hope it is n't mouse ? " and then she thought that did not look quite polite ; so she scratched out " is n't mouse " and changed it to " i hope it will be fine , " and she gave her letter to the postman .
