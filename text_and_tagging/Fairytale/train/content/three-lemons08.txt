after a while , when the kitchen - maid had to go to the pond to fetch water , she caught a great silver fish in her pail . she carried it up and showed it to the king , who thought it was a beauty ; but the homely princess declared it to be the work of witches , and that they were to burn it , for she had noticed at once what it was . so the following morning the fish was burned , and they found a lump of silver in the ashes . then the cook went up and told the king , and he thought it very strange ; but the princess said it was witchcraft pure and simple , and that they were to bury the silver under the manure - pile . the king did not want to , but she gave him no peace until he consented , and finally said they were to do so . but on the following day a beautiful linden - tree stood where they had buried the lump of silver , and the leaves of the linden - tree glistened like silver , too . when they told the king he thought it remarkable ; but the princess said it was no more nor less than witchcraft , and that the linden - tree must be cut down .
