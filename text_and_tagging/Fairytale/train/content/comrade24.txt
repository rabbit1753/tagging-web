the princess grew as pale as a corpse . she made the best of a bad bargain , and said that he had done well . now there was only one more little test for him to undergo . " if you can bring me what i am thinking about by to - morrow noon , then you may have me and keep me . " the youth felt as though he had been condemned to death . it seemed altogether impossible for him to know of what the princess was thinking , and still more impossible to bring her the thing in question . and when he came to his room his comrade could scarcely quiet him . he said he would take the matter in hand , as he had done on the other occasions , and at last the youth grew calmer , and lay down to sleep . in the meantime the comrade went to the smith , and had him weld an additional twenty - four pounds of iron on his sword . when this had been done , he went to the stable , and gave the goat such a smashing blow between the horns that he flew to the other side of the wall .
