after a while he began to feel rather tired , as indeed he had been on his legs since daybreak . he also began to feel rather hungry . in the fulness of his joy at getting the cow , he had eaten up all he had . at last he could scarcely go on at all , and had to make a halt every moment . the stones weighed him down most unmercifully . he could not help wishing that he did not feel obliged to drag them along . and on he went at a snail 's pace until he came to a well . then he thought he would rest and take a drink of the fresh water . and he placed the stones carefully by his side at the edge of the well . then he sat down , and as he stooped to drink , he happened to give the stones a little push . they both fell into the water with a splash .
