then she shook the tree until the apples fell like rain , and she shook until there were no more to fall ; and when she had gathered them together in a heap , she went on farther . at last she came to a little house , and an old woman was peeping out of it , but she had such great teeth that the girl was terrified and about to run away , only the old woman called her back . " what are you afraid of , my dear child ? come and live with me , and if you do the house - work well and orderly , things shall go well with you . you must take great pains to make my bed well , and shake it up thoroughly , so that the feathers fly about , and then in the world it snows , for i am mother hulda .
