she , too , was told to look out at the back door , and she was only too glad to do so ; for she fully expected to see a third coach - and - six coming rolling along the high road , straight for the castle door . but , alas and alack ! no such sight greeted her eager eyes , for the high road was quite deserted , and in great disappointment she ran back to the hen - wife to tell her so . " then it is clear that thy fortune is not coming to meet thee this day , " said the old dame , " so thou must e'en come back to - morrow . " so the little princess went home again , and next day she turned up once more at the old wife 's cottage . but once more she was disappointed , for although she looked out long and eagerly , no glad sight of a coach - and - six , or of any other coach , greeted her eyes . on the third day , however , what should she see but a great black bull coming rushing along the road , bellowing as it came , and tossing its head fiercely in the air . in great alarm , the little princess shut the door , and ran to the hen - wife to tell her about the furious animal that was approaching . " hech , hinnie , " cried the old woman , holding up her hands in dismay , " and who would have thocht that the black bull of norroway wad be your fate ! " at the words , the poor little maiden grew pale . she had come out to seek her fortune , but it had never dawned upon her that her fortune could be anything so terrible as this .
