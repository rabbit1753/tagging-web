forthwith he bade his men fetch him a comb of gold and a scissors with loops of silver , and he combed the hair of kilweh his guest . ' tell me who you are , ' he said , ' for my heart warms to you , and i feel you are come of my blood . ' ' i am kilweh , son of kilydd , ' replied the youth . ' then my cousin you are in truth , ' replied arthur , ' and whatever boon you may ask you shall receive . ' ' the boon i crave is that you may win for me olwen , the daughter of yspaddaden penkawr , and this boon i seek likewise at the hands of thy warriors . from sol , who can stand all day upon one foot ; from ossol , who , if he were to find himself on the top of the highest mountain in the world , could make it into a level plain in the beat of a bird 's wing ; from cluse , who , though he were buried under the earth , could yet hear the ant leave her nest fifty miles away : from these and from kai and from bedwyr and from all thy mighty men i crave this boon . ' ' o kilweh , ' said arthur , ' never have i heard of the maiden of whom you speak of , nor of her kindred , but i will send messengers to seek her if you will give me time . '
