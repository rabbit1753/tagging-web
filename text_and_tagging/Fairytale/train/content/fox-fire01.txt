once upon a time there was a strong young farmer who came home late one evening from market . his way led him past the gardens of a wealthy gentleman , in which stood a number of tall buildings . suddenly he saw something shining floating in the air inside the gardens , something which glowed like a ball of crystal . he was astonished , and climbed the wall around the gardens , but there was not a human being in sight ; all he saw was , at a distance , something which appeared to be a dog , looking up at the moon . and whenever it blew its breath out a ball of fire came out of its mouth , and rose to the moon . and whenever it drew its breath in the ball sank down again , and it caught it in its jaws . and so it went on without a stop .
