" ugh , you beast ! " said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket , when he saw the toad . " you 're the ugliest thing i 've seen for one while . " and he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad , which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles which grew high by the well 's brink . here she saw stem by stem , but she looked up also . the sun shone through the leaves , which were quite transparent . she felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest , where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves .
