there was once an old goat who had seven little ones , and was as fond of them as ever mother was of her children . one day she had to go into the wood to fetch food for them , so she called them all round her . " dear children , " said she , " i am going out into the wood ; and while i am gone , be on your guard against the wolf , for if he were once to get inside he would eat you up , skin , bones , and all . the wretch often disguises himself , but he may always be known by his hoarse voice and black paws . " " dear mother , " answered the kids , " you need not be afraid , we will take good care of ourselves . " and the mother bleated good - bye , and went on her way with an easy mind .
