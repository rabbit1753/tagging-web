the captain repeated his instructions . " they will not gain you anything , " said the duke . " you can see how many soldiers i have , and if the king chooses to listen to me , we can agree to become friends , i will aid him against all his enemies , and what we undertake will succeed . " the captain was pleased with this proposal , so the duke invited him to the castle , together with all his officers , and his soldiers were given a swallow or two of something wet and plenty to eat along with it . but while the duke and the officers were eating and drinking , there was more or less talk , and the duke learned that the king had a daughter , as yet unmarried and so lovely that her like had never been seen . and the more they brought the king 's officers to eat , the stronger they inclined to the opinion that the king 's daughter would make a good wife for the duke . and as they talked about it , the duke himself began to think it over . the worst of it was , said the officers , that she was very haughty , and never even deigned to look at a man . but the duke only laughed . " if it be no worse than that , " he said , " it is a trouble that may be cured . "
