' the girls , however , were very hungry , so they ate and drank with a good appetite . when they had finished aina yawned , stretched out her arms and said : ' oh , if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now ! ' scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side , and there beside lisa was one too . this seemed to the girls more and more wonderful , but tired and sleepy as they were , they thought no more about it , but crept into the little beds , drew the coverlets over their heads and were soon asleep .
