" with all the veins of my heart , " replied oonagh . " get up , acushla , and show this decent little man something that wo n't be unworthy of your father , finn m'coul . " finn , who was dressed for the occasion as much like a boy as possible , got up , and bringing far rua out , " are you strong ? " said he . " thunder and ounze ! " exclaimed the other , " what a voice in so small a chap ! " " are you strong ? " said finn again . " are you able to squeeze water out of that white stone ? " he asked , putting one into far rua 's hand . the latter squeezed and squeezed the stone , but to no purpose ; he might pull the rocks of lumford 's glen asunder , and flatten a thunderbolt , but to squeeze water out of a white stone was beyond his strength . finn eyed him with great contempt as he kept straining and squeezing and squeezing and straining till he got black in the face with the efforts . " ah , you 're a poor creature , " said finn . " you a giant ! give me the stone here , and when i 'll show what finn 's little son can do you may then judge of what my daddy himself is . " finn then took the stone , and then , slyly exchanging it for the curds , he squeezed the latter until the whey , as clear as water , oozed out in a little shower from his hand . " i 'll now go in , " said he , " to my cradle ; for i scorn to lose my time with anyone that 's not able to eat my daddy 's bread , or squeeze water out of a stone . bedad , you had better be off out of this before he comes back , for if he catches you , it 's in flummery he 'd have you in two minutes .
