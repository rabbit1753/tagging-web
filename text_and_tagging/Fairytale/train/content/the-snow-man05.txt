the whole day the snow - man looked through the window ; towards dusk the room grew still more inviting ; the stove gave out a mild light , not at all like the moon or even the sun ; no , as only a stove can shine , when it has something to feed upon . when the door of the room was open , it flared up - this was one of its peculiarities ; it flickered quite red upon the snow - man 's white face . ' i ca n't stand it any longer ! ' he said . ' how beautiful it looks with its tongue stretched out like that ! ' it was a long night , but the snow - man did not find it so ; there he stood , wrapt in his pleasant thoughts , and they froze , so that he cracked . next morning the panes of the kitchen window were covered with ice , and the most beautiful ice - flowers that even a snow - man could desire , only they blotted out the stove . the window would not open ; he could n't see the stove which he thought was such a lovely lady . there was a cracking and cracking inside him and all around ; there was just such a frost as a snow - man would delight in . but this snow - man was different : how could he feel happy ?
