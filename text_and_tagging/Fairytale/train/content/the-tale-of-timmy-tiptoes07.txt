" it laughed and chuckled when it heard timmy 's story . while timmy was confined to bed , it enticed him to eat quantities--"but how shall i ever get out through that hole unless i thin myself ? my wife will be anxious ! " " just another nut -- or two nuts ; let me crack them for you , " said the chipmunk . timmy tiptoes grew fatter and fatter !
