then she felt sorry for the lion , grew braver , went up to him , unloosed his chains and said : " your chains i can loose for you ; but i can never be your best friend . for i have never loved any one more than my lame dog and will never love any one else better . " and then a wondrous thing took place : at the very moment the last chain fell from him , the lion turned into a handsome young prince , and when the princess looked at him more closely , it was none other than her heart 's dearest , who before had been a dog . she sank to the ground , clasped his knees , and begged him not to leave her again . but the prince raised her with deep affection , took her in his arms and said : " no , now we shall never more be parted , for i am released from my enchantment , and have proved your faith toward me in every way .
