then the prince climbed the hair and so reached the nest . there were the three eggs ; he gathered them , and then he came down as he had gone up . after that the wind came again and loosed the maiden 's hair from the branches , and she bound it up as it was before . " now , listen , " said she to the prince : " when the old witch asks you for the three crow 's eggs which you have gathered , tell her that they belong to the one who found them . she will not be able to take them from you , and they are worth something , i can tell you . " at sunset the old witch came hobbling along , and there sat the prince at the foot of the fir - tree . " have you gathered the crow 's eggs ? " said she . " yes , " said the prince , " here they are in my handkerchief . and now may i have the one who draws the water and builds the fire ? " " yes , " said the old witch , " you may have her ; only give me my crow 's eggs . " " no , " said the prince , " the crow 's eggs are none of yours , for they belong to him who gathered them . "
