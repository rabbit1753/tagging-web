at the time when the animals reigned in the earth , they had killed all the people but a girl and her little brother . these two were living in fear , in an out - of - the - way place . the boy was a perfect little pigmy , and never grew beyond the size of a mere infant . the girl increased with her years , so that the task of providing food and shelter fell wholly upon her . she went out daily to get wood for the lodge - fire , and she took her little brother with her that no mishap might befall him . he was too little to leave alone . a big bird , of a mischievous disposition , might have flown away with him . she made him a bow and arrows , and said to him one day , " my little brother , i will leave you behind where i have been gathering the wood . you must hide yourself , and you will soon see the snow - birds come and pick the worms out of the logs which i have piled up . shoot one of them and bring it home . " he obeyed her , and tried his best to kill one , but he came home unsuccessful . his sister told him that he must not despair , but try again the next day .
