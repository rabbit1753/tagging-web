" nay , i know not , " said the woman , " and you can not see ! many flowers and trees have withered this night . death will soon come and plant them over again ! you certainly know that every person has his or her life 's tree or flower , just as everyone happens to be settled . they look like other plants , but they have pulsations of the heart . children 's hearts can also beat . go after yours , perhaps you may know your child 's . but what will you give me if i tell you what you shall do more ? " " i have nothing to give , " said the afflicted mother , " but i will go to the world 's end for you ! " " nay , i have nothing to do there ! " said the woman . " but you can give me your long black hair . you know yourself that it is fine , and that i like ! you shall have my white hair instead , and that 's always something ! " " do you demand nothing else ? " said she . " that i will gladly give you ! " and she gave her her fine black hair , and got the old woman 's snow - white hair instead .
