she was frightened , and wanted to throw the red shoes away ; but they stuck fast . she tore off her stockings , but the shoes had grown fast to her feet . she danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow , in rain and sunshine , by night and by day -- but by night it was most horrible . she danced out into the open churchyard ; but the dead there did not dance . they had something better to do than that . she wanted to sit down on the pauper 's grave where the bitter fern grows ; but for her there was neither peace nor rest . and as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes , with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth ; his face was stern and grave , and in his hand he held a broad shining sword .
