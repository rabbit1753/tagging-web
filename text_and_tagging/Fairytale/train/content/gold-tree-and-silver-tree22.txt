" take me to the door of the apartment , " commanded the queen . " at least i can speak to my dear daughter through it . " and the lackey , who did not see what harm could possibly come from this , did as he was bid . " if the key is really lost , and thou canst not come out to welcome me , dear gold - tree , " said the deceitful queen . " at least put your little finger through the keyhole that i may kiss it . " the princess did so , never dreaming that evil could come to her through such a simple action . but it did . for instead of kissing the tiny finger , her step - mother stabbed it with a poisoned needle . so deadly was the poison , that , before she could utter a single cry , the poor princess fell , as one dead , on the floor .
