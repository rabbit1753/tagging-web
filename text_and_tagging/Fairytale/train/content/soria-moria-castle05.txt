" and though he had four , i should like to see him , " said the youth . " and i am not going away , for i have done no wrong . but you must give me something to eat , for i am terribly hungry . " when halvor had eaten his fill , the princess told him to try and see whether he could swing the sword that hung on the wall . but he could not swing it , nor even raise it . " well , " said the princess , " you must take a swallow from the bottle that hangs beside it , for that is what the troll does when he wants to use the sword . " halvor took the swallow , and then could swing the sword at once as though it were nothing at all . now , thought he , the troll could just come along any time . and sure enough , he did come along , roaring . halvor placed himself behind the door . " hu ! it smells like christian blood here ! " said the troll , and poked his head in through the door . " yes , you shall find out it is here and at once , " cried halvor , and hewed off all his heads . the princess was filled with joy at her deliverance , and danced and sang . but then she happened to think of her sisters , and said : " if only my sisters could also be delivered ! " " where are they ? " asked halvor . so she told him that one of them had been carried off by a troll to a castle six miles further away , and the other to a castle that lay nine miles away from the other .
