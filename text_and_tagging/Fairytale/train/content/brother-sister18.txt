the nurse said nothing , but as soon as the queen had disappeared she went to the king and told him all . the king said , " ah , heaven ! what do i hear ! i will myself watch by the child to - morrow night . " so at evening he went into the nursery , and at midnight the queen appeared , and said , " my child my fawn once more i come to see , once more i come , and then the end must be . " and she tended the child , as she was accustomed to do , before she vanished . the king dared not speak to her , but he watched again the following night , and heard her say , " my child my fawn this once i come to see , this once i come , and now the end must be . "
