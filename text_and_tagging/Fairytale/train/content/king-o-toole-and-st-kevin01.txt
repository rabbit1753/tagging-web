there was once a king , called king o'toole , who was a fine old king in the old ancient times , long ago . it was him that owned the churches in the early days . " surely , " said i , " the churches were not in king o'toole 's time ? " " oh , by no means , your honor -- truth , it 's yourself that 's right enough there . but you know the place is called ' the churches ' because they were built after by st . kavin , and went by the name of the churches ever more . therefore , of course , the place bein ' so called , i say that the king owned the churches -- and why not , sir , seein ' it was his birthright , time out o ' mind , beyond the flood ? well , the king ( you see ) was the right sort -- he was the real boy , and loved sport as he loved his life , and huntin ' in particular . from the risin ' o ' the sun up he got , and away he went over the mountains beyond after the deer : and the fine times them were . the deer was as plenty thin , aye truth , far more plentiful than the sheep is now . that 's the way it was with the king , from the crow o ' the cock to the song o ' the redbreast .
