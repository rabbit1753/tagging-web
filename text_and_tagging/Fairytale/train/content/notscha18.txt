thus half a year passed . then li dsing , on the occasion of a great military drill , once came by the cliff in question , and saw the people crowding thickly about the hill like a swarm of ants . li dsing inquired what there were to see upon the hill . " it is a new god , who performs so many miracles that people come from far and near to honor him . " " what sort of a god is he ? " asked li dsing . they did not dare conceal from him who the god was . then li dsing grew angry . he spurred his horse up the hill and , sure enough , over the door of the temple was written : " notscha 's shrine . " and within it was the likeness of notscha , just as he had appeared while living . li dsing said : " while you were alive you brought misfortune to your parents . now that you are dead you deceive the people . it is disgusting ! " with these words he drew forth his whip , beat notscha 's idolatrous likeness to pieces with it , had the temple burned down , and the worshipers mildly reproved . then he returned home .
