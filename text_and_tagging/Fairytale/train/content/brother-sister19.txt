then the king could contain himself no longer , but rushed towards her , saying , " you are no other than my dear wife ! " then she answered , " yes , i am your dear wife , " and in that moment , by the grace of heaven , her life returned to her , and she was once more well and strong . then she told the king the snare that the wicked witch and her daughter had laid for her . the king had them both brought to judgment , and sentence was passed upon them . the daughter was sent away into the wood , where she was devoured by the wild beasts , and the witch was burned , and ended miserably . and as soon as her body was in ashes the spell was removed from the fawn , and he took human shape again ; and then the sister and brother lived happily together until the end .
