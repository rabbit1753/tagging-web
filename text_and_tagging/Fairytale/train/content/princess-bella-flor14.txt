' do not be frightened , ' said the horse . ' get on my back , and i will gallop till my whole body is wet with perspiration , then rub it all over your skin , and no matter how hot the oil may be you will never feel it . ' jose did not ask any more questions , but did as the horse bade him ; and men wondered at his cheerful face as they lowered him into the caldron of boiling oil . he was left there till bella - flor cried that he must be cooked enough . then out came a youth so young and handsome , that everyone fell in love with him , and bella - flor most of all . as for the old king , he saw that he had lost the game ; and in despair he flung himself into the caldron , and was fried instead of jose . then jose was proclaimed king , on condition that he married bella - flor which he promised to do the next day . but first he went to the stables and sought out the horse , and said to him : ' it is to you that i owe my life and my crown . why have you done all this for me ? ' and the horse answered : ' i am the soul of that unhappy man for whom you spent all your fortune . and when i saw you in danger of death i begged that i might help you , as you had helped me . for , as i told you , good deeds bear their own fruit !
