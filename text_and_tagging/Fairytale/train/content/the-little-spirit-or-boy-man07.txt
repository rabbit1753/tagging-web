the boy - man said , " why do you mind them ? give me something to eat . " " how can you think of eating at such a time ? " she replied . " do as i request you , and be quick . " she then gave little spirit his dish , and he commenced eating . just then the brothers came to the door . " see ! " cried the sister , " the man with four heads ! " the brothers were about to lift the curtain at the door , when the boy - man turned his dish upside down . immediately the door was closed with a stone , upon which the four brothers set to work and hammered with their clubs with great fury . at length they succeeded in making a slight opening . one of the brothers presented his face at this little window , and rolled his eye about at the boy - man in a very threatening way . the little spirit , who , when he had closed the door , had returned to his meal , which he was quietly eating , took up his bow and arrow which lay by his side , he let fly the shaft , which , striking the man in the head , he fell back . the boy - man merely called out " number one " as he fell , and went on with his meal .
