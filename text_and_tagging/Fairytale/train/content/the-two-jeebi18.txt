" there is one point , " they added , " of which we wish to speak . you have thought our conduct very strange and rude in possessing ourselves of the choicest parts of your hunt . _ that _ was the point of trial selected to put you to . it is the wife 's peculiar privilege . you love your wife . for another to usurp what belongs to her , we know to be the severest test of her goodness of heart , and consequently of your temper and feelings . we knew your manners and customs , but we came to prove you , not by complying with but by violating them . pardon us . we are the agents of him who sent us . peace to your dwelling . farewell ! " when they ceased , total darkness filled the lodge . no object could be seen . the inmates heard the lodge - door open and shut , but they never saw more of the two spirits . the hunter found the success which they had promised . he became celebrated in the chase , and never wanted for any thing . he had many children , all of whom grew up to manhood ; and he who had lain in the lodge , a little child , while the jeebi dwelt there , led them in all good deeds , and health , peace , and long life were the rewards of the hunter 's hospitality .
