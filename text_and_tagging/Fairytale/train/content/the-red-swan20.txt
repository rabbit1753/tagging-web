" hold a minute , " interposed the kettle , as maidwa was about to dip in his ladle . he paused , and after a delay , the kettle , shaking itself up and simmering very loudly , said , " now we are ready . " maidwa fell to and satisfied his hunger . " will the kettle now withdraw ? " asked the magician , with am air of much deference . " no , " said the kettle , " we will stay and hear what the young man has to say for himself . " " very well , " said the magician . " you see , " he added to maidwa , " how poor i am . i have to take counsel with the kettle , or i should be all alone , without a day 's food , and with no one to advise me . " all this time the red swan was carefully concealed in the lodge , behind a curtain , from which maidwa heard now and then a rustling noise , that fluttered his spirits and set his heart to beating at a wonderful rate . as soon as maidwa had partaken of food and laid aside his leggings and moccasins , the old magician commenced telling him how he had lost his scalp , the insults it was receiving , the pain he suffered thereby , his wishes to regain it , the many unsuccessful attempts that had already been made , and the numbers and power of those who retained it . he would interrupt his discourse , at times , with sudden groans , and say : " oh , how shamefully they are treating it . " maidwa listened to all the old magician had to say with solemn attention . the magician renewed his discourse , and inquired of maidwa as to his dreams , or what he saw in his sleep , at such times as he had fasted and darkened his face to procure guardian spirits . maidwa then told him one dream . the magician groaned . " no , that is not it , " he said .
