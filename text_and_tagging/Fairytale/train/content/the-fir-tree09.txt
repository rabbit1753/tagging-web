' how beautifully you tell stories ! ' said the little mice . and next evening they came with four others , who wanted to hear the tree 's story , and it told still more , for it remembered everything so clearly and thought : ' those were happy times ! but they may come again . humpty dumpty fell downstairs , and yet he married a princess ; perhaps i shall also marry a princess ! ' and then it thought of a pretty little birch - tree that grew out in the wood , and seemed to the fir - tree a real princess , and a very beautiful one too . ' who is humpty dumpty ? ' asked the little mice . and then the tree told the whole story ; it could remember every single word , and the little mice were ready to leap on to the topmost branch out of sheer joy !
