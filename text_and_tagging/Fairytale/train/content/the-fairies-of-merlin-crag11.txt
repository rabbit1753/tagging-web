so he was feeling very happy , and as he walked along he was humming a tune to himself . his road took him by the foot of merlin 's crag , and as he approached it he was astonished to find himself growing strangely tired . his eyelids dropped over his eyes as if he were going to sleep , and his feet grew as heavy as lead . " i will sit down and take a rest for a few minutes , " he said to himself ; " the road home never seemed so long as it does to - day . " so he sat down on a tuft of grass right under the shadow of the crag , and before he knew where he was he had fallen into a deep and heavy slumber . when he awoke it was near midnight , and the moon had risen on the crag . and he rubbed his eyes , when by its soft light he became aware of a large band of fairies who were dancing round and round him , singing and laughing , pointing their tiny fingers at him , and shaking their wee fists in his face . the bewildered man rose and tried to walk away from them , but turn in whichever direction he would the fairies accompanied him , encircling him in a magic ring , out of which he could in no way go . at last they stopped , and , with shrieks of elfin laughter , led the prettiest and daintiest of their companions up to him , and cried , " tread a measure , tread a measure , oh , man ! then wilt thou not be so eager to escape from our company .
