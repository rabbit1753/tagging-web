" he surely is a kind master , " said the king 's son to himself , walked up and down the room , and whistled and sang . he thought there would be plenty of time to clean the stable . " but it would be nice to take a look at the other room , there surely must be something in it that he is alarmed about , since i am not so much as to take a look , " thought he , and went into the first room . there hung a kettle , and it was boiling , but the king 's son could find no fire beneath it . " what can there be in it ? " thought he , and dipped in a lock of his hair , and at once the hair grew just like copper . " that 's a fine soup , and whoever tastes it will burn his mouth , " said the youth , and went into the next room . there hung another kettle that bubbled and boiled . but there was no fire beneath it , either . " i must try this one , too , " said the king 's son , and again he dipped in a lock of his hair and it grew just like silver . " we have no such expensive soup at home , " said the king 's son , " but the main thing is , how does it taste ? " and with that he went into the third room . and there hung still another kettle , a - boiling just like those in the two other rooms , and the king 's son wanted to try this one , too . he dipped in a lock of his hair , and it came out like pure gold , and fairly shimmered .
