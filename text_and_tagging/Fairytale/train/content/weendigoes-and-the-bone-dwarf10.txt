the hunter , on entering , found his son sitting by the fire , very quiet and unconcerned , although he saw that all the articles of the lodge were lying thrown about in all directions . " why , my son , " he said " you must play very hard every day ; and what is it that you do , all alone , to throw the lodge in such confusion ? " the boy again had his excuse . " father , " he answered , " i play in this manner : i chase and drag my blanket around the lodge , and that is the reason you see the ashes spread about . " the hunter was not satisfied until his son had shown him how he played with the blanket , which he did so adroitly as to set his father laughing , and at last drive him out of the lodge with the great clouds of ashes that he raised . the next morning the boy renewed his request that his father should be absent all day , and see if he could not kill two deer . the hunter thought this a strange desire on the part of his son , but as he had always humored the boy , he went into the forest as usual , bent on accomplishing his wish , if he could . as soon as he was out of sight , his son hastened to his young companion at the tree , and they continued their sports . the father on nearing his home in the evening , as he reached the rising ground , again heard the sounds of play and laughter ; and as the wind brought them straight to his ear , he was now certain that there were two voices .
