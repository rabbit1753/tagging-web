but the giant was now in sight , roaring like a hundred lions , and the other giant was out in a moment , and the chase kept on . for every two springs the horses gave , the giants gave three , and at last they were only seventy perches off . then the prince stopped again , and flung the second knife behind him . down went all the flat field , till there was a quarry between them a quarter of a mile deep , and the bottom filled with black water ; and before the giants could get round it , the prince and princesses were inside the kingdom of the great magician , where the high thorny hedge opened of itself to everyone that he chose to let in . there was joy enough between the three sisters , till the two eldest saw their lovers turned into stone . but while they were shedding tears for them , seven inches came in , and touched them with his rod . so they were flesh , and blood , and life once more , and there was great hugging and kissing , and all sat down to breakfast , and seven inches sat at the head of the table .
