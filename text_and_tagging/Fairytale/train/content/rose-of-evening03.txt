in dschen - giang there once lived a widow named dsiang , who had a son called aduan . when he was no more than seven years of age he was extraordinarily skilful , and no other boy could equal him . and his reputation increasing as he grew , he earned more and more money . so it happened that he was still called upon at the dragon junk festival when he was already sixteen . but one day he fell into the water below the gold island and was drowned . he was the only son of his mother , and she sorrowed over him , and that was the end of it .
