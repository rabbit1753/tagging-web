" all night long i could not sleep . the next evening when i gave another performance and the lecturer was present , i was in one of my best moods . " i once heard of an actor , who , when he had to act the part of a lover , always thought of one particular lady in the audience . he only played for her , and forgot all the rest of the house , and now the polytechnic lecturer was my she , my only auditor , for whom alone i played .
