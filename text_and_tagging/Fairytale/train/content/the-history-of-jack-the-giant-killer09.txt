the giant wondered more and more at this ; yet he did not answer a word , but went to bring two great bowls of hasty - pudding for their breakfast . jack wanted to make the giant believe that he could eat as much as himself , so he contrived to button a leathern bag inside his coat , and slip the hasty - pudding into this bag , while he seemed to put it into his mouth . when breakfast was over he said to the giant : " now i will show you a fine trick . i can cure all wounds with a touch ; i could cut off my head in one minute , and the next put it sound again on my shoulders . you shall see an example . " he then took hold of the knife , ripped up the leathern bag , and all the hasty - pudding tumbled out upon the floor .
