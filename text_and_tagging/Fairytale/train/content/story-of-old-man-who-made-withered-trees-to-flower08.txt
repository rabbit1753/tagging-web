shiro 's master thought this a strange request , because he knew quite well that not only did his neighbor not love his pet dog . he never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting him whenever the dog crossed his path . but the good old man was too kind - hearted to refuse his neighbor , so he consented to lend the dog on condition that he should be taken great care of . the wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face . he told his wife how he had succeeded in his crafty intentions . he then took his spade and hastened to his own field , forcing the unwilling shiro to follow him . as soon as he reached a yenoki tree , he said to the dog , threateningly : " if there were gold coins under your master 's tree , there must also be gold coins under my tree . you must find them for me ! where are they ? where ? where ?
