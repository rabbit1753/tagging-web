" i wonder who it was that spoke to me just now ! was it you , mr . hare ? you must be very lonely all by yourself ! " " oh , no , i am not at all lonely , " said the hare , " but as it was such a fine day i came out here to enjoy myself . wo n't you stop and play with me a little while ? " the crocodile came out of the sea and sat on the shore , and the two played together for some time . then the hare said : " mr . crocodile , you live in the sea and i live on this island . we do not often meet , so i know very little about you . tell me , do you think the number of your company is greater than mine ? " " of course , there are more crocodiles than hares , " answered the crocodile . " can you not see that for yourself ? you live on this small island , while i live in the sea , which spreads through all parts of the world . if i call together all the crocodiles who dwell in the sea you hares will be as nothing compared to us ! " the crocodile was very conceited .
