' here , my poor darling,'says he , ' is your eldest child , and there , ' says he , pointing to a woman that was looking on with a smile on her face , ' is the eagle that carried him away . ' she forgot all her sorrows in a moment , hugging her child , and laughing and crying over him . the woman washed their feet , and rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their bones , and made them as fresh as a daisy . next morning , just before sunrise , he was up , and prepared to be off , ' here , ' said he to her , ' is a thing which may be of use to you . it 's a scissors , and whatever stuff you cut with it will be turned into silk . the moment the sun rises , i 'll lose all memory of yourself and the children , but i 'll get it at sunset again . farewell ! ' but he was n't far gone till she was in sight of him again , leaving her boy behind . it was the same to - day as yesterday : their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the evening . he never stopped , and she never stopped , and as the sun was setting he turned up another lane , and there they found their little daughter . it was all joy and comfort again till morning , and then the third day 's journey commenced .
