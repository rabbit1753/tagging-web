the marriage took place the following month , and a few days later the old man died quite suddenly . now jegu had everything to see to himself , and somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive . but once more the brownie stepped in , and was better than ten labourers . it was he who ploughed and sowed and reaped , and if , as happened , occasionally , it was needful to get the work done quickly , the brownie called in some of his friends , and as soon as it was light a host of little dwarfs might have been seen in the fields , busy with hoe , fork or sickle . but by the time the people were about all was finished , and the little fellows had disappeared .
