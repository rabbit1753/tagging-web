duchess considered and considered and read ribby 's letter again-- " a pink and white pie - dish - and you shall eat it all . ' you ' means me -- then ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself ? a pink and white pie - dish ! ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins ..... oh what a good idea ! why should n't i rush along and put my pie into ribby 's oven when ribby is n't there ? " duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness !
