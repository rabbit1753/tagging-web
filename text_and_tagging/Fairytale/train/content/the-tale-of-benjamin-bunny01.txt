one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank . he pricked his ears and listened to the trit - trot , trit - trot of a pony . a gig was coming along the road ; it was driven by mr . mcgregor , and beside him sat mrs . mcgregor in her best bonnet . as soon as they had passed , little benjamin bunny slid down into the road , and set off -- with a hop , skip and a jump -- to call upon his relations , who lived in the wood at the back of mr . mcgregor 's garden . that wood was full of rabbit holes ; and in the neatest sandiest hole of all , cousins -- flopsy , mopsy , cotton - tail and peter .
