then there was joy and rejoicing , you may be sure ! only the two elder brothers looked down in the mouth , for since the young prince had found the thief who stole the golden pears , their father 's kingdom was not for them . but the prince soon set their minds at rest on that score , for he had enough and more than enough of his own . after that the prince and the swan maiden were married , and a grand wedding they had of it , with music of fiddles and kettle - drums , and plenty to eat and to drink . i , too , was there ; but all of the good red wine ran down over my tucker , so that not a drop of it passed my lips , and i had to come away empty . and that is all .
