karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes , but the old lady thought them hideous , and so they were burnt . karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly ; she was taught to read and to sew , and people said that she was pretty . but the mirror told her , " you are more than pretty -- you are beautiful . " one day the queen was travelling through that part of the country , and had her little daughter , who was a princess , with her . all the people , amongst them karen too , streamed towards the castle , where the little princess , in fine white clothes , stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at . she wore neither a train nor a golden crown , but beautiful red morocco shoes ; they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker 's wife had sewn for little karen . there is really nothing in the world that can be compared to red shoes !
