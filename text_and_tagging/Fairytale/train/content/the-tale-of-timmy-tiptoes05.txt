but when the other squirrels heard that song , they rushed upon timmy tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him , and upset his bag of nuts . the innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief , flew away in a fright ! timmy rolled over and over , and then turned tail and fled towards his nest , followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--"who's - been digging - up my - nuts ? " they caught him and dragged him up the very same tree , where there was the little round hole , and they pushed him in . the hole was much too small for timmy tiptoes ' figure . they squeezed him dreadfully , it was a wonder they did not break his ribs . " we will leave him here till he confesses , " said silvertail squirrel , and he shouted into the hole-- " who's - been - digging - up my - nuts ? " timmy tiptoes made no reply ; he had tumbled down inside the tree , upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself . he lay quite stunned and still .
