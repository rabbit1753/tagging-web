spring had now revisited the north . the cold winds had all blown themselves away , the ice had melted , the streams were open , and smiled as they looked at the blue sky once more ; and the forests , far and wide , in their green mantle , echoed every cheerful sound . but it is in vain that spring returns , and that the heart of nature is opened in bounty , if we are not thankful to the master of life , who has preserved us through the winter . nor does that man answer the end for which he was made who does not show a kind and charitable feeling to all who are in want or sickness , especially to his blood relations .
