' let me try , ' cried biernuga , the bony fish , but he had no better luck , and no more had kumbal , the bream , nor any of the rest . ' it is no use , ' exclaimed thuggai , at last . ' the wood is too wet . we must just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it . ' then a very little fish indeed , not more than four inches long and the youngest of the tribe , bowed himself before thuggai , saying , ' ask my father , guddhu the cod , to light the fire . he is skilled in magic more than most fishes . ' so thuggai asked him , and guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree , and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes . then he knelt by the side of the fire and blew at it for a long while , till slowly the feeble red glow became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling up . when the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close , keeping their backs towards the piercing wind , but guddhu told them they must go to the other side , as he wanted the wind to fan his fire . by and by the spark grew into a flame , and a merry crackling was heard .
