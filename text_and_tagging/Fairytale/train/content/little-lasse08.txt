' i am so afraid that the buffaloes will butt us , and the great serpent eat us up . let us travel to another part of the world . ' ' very well , ' said the dream - boy with the white coat , ' it is only a little way to polynesia'--and then they were there . it was very warm there , as warm as in a hot bath in finland . costly spices grew on the shores : the pepper plant , the cinnamon tree , ginger , saffron ; the coffee plant and the tea plant . brown people with long ears and thick lips , and hideously painted faces , hunted a yellow - spotted tiger among the high bamboos on the shore , and the tiger turned on them and stuck its claws into one of the brown men . then all the others took to flight .
