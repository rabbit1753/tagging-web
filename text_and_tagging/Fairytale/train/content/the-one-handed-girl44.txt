the story went on , but the story - teller never once looked at the prince , even through her veil , though he on his side never moved his eyes from her . when she reached the part where she had sat weeping in the tree , the king 's son could restrain himself no longer . ' it is my wife , ' he cried , springing to where she sat with the sleeping child in her lap . ' they have lied to me , and you are not dead after all , nor the boy either ! but what has happened ? why did they lie to me ? and why did you leave my house where you were safe ? ' and he turned and looked fiercely at his father . ' let me finish my tale first , and then you will know , ' answered she , throwing back her veil , and she told how her brother had come to the palace and accused her of being a witch , and had tried to persuade the king to slay her . ' but he would not do that , ' she continued softly , ' and after all , if i had stayed on in your house , i should never have met the snake , nor have got my hand back again . so let us forget all about it , and be happy once more , for see ! our son is growing quite a big boy . ' ' and what shall be done to your brother ? ' asked the king , who was glad to think that someone had acted in this matter worse than himself . ' put him out of the town , ' answered she .
