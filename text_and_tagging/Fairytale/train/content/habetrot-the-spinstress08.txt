the next day it was even worse , for her arms ached so much she could only work very slowly . that night she cried herself to sleep ; and next morning , seeing that it was quite hopeless to expect to get her task finished , she threw down her distaff in despair , and ran out of doors . near the house was a deep dell , through which ran a tiny stream . maisie loved this dell , the flowers grew so abundantly there . this morning she ran down to the edge of the stream , and seated herself on a large stone . it was a glorious morning , the hazel trees were newly covered with leaves , and the branches nodded over her head , and showed like delicate tracery against the blue sky . the primroses and sweet - scented violets peeped out from among the grass , and a little water wagtail came and perched on a stone in the middle of the stream , and bobbed up and down , till it seemed as if he were nodding to maisie , and as if he were trying to say to her , " never mind , cheer up .
