in time she told them all that had happened to her , and they did n't know what to advise her to do . she was as fond of her husband as ever , and said she was sure that he could n't help letting the children go ; but still she was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from her . well , the mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to bring eggs to the castle , for they had great faith in her wisdom . she said the only plan was to secure the bear 's skin that the prince was obliged to put on every morning , and get it burned , and then he could n't help being a man night and day , and the enchantment would be at an end . so they all persuaded her to do that , and she promised she would ; and after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again that she made the wish the same night , and when she woke three hours after , she was in her husband 's palace , and he himself was watching over her . there was great joy on both sides , and they were happy for many days .
