success again attended him , and he returned , bringing with him a deer , and he found that a lodge had sprung up as before , where he had hung his bundle . he looked in and saw a beautiful female sitting alone , with his bundle by her side . she arose and came out toward the deer which he had deposited at the door , and he immediately went into the lodge and sat by the fire , as he was weary with the day 's hunt , which had carried him far away . the woman did not return , and wondering at her delay , iena at last arose , and peeping through the door of the lodge , beheld her greedily eating all the fat of the deer . he exclaimed , " i thought i was blessed , but i find i was mistaken . " then addressing the woman : " poor marten , " said he , " feast on the game i have brought . " he again took up his bundle and departed ; and , as usual , hung it upon the branch of a tree , and wandered off in quest of game .
