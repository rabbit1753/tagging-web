good gracious ! how the princess did wonder at the pretty musical box ! she must and would have it at any price ; but this time it was five - and - twenty kisses that the lad was wanting for his musical box , and he would take nothing more nor less than just that much for it . moreover , she would have to come up on the hillside and give them to him , for he could not leave his geese even for five - and - twenty kisses . but you should have seen what a stew the princess was in at this ! five - and - twenty kisses , indeed ! and did the fellow think that it was for the likes of her to be kissing a poor gooseherd ? he might keep his musical box if that was the price he asked for it ; that was what she said .
