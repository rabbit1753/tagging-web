there once lived an indian in the north who had ten daughters , all of whom grew up to womanhood . they were noted for their beauty , especially oweenee , the youngest , who was very independent in her way of thinking . she was a great admirer of romantic places , and spent much of her time with the flowers and winds and clouds in the open air . though the flower were homely , if it was fragrant -- though the wind were rough , if it was healthful -- and though the cloud were dark , if it embosomed the fruitful rain , she knew how , in spite of appearances , to acknowledge the good qualities concealed from the eye . she paid very little attention to the many handsome young men who came to her father 's lodge for the purpose of seeing her .
