when breakfast was over , he took them into another room , where there was nothing but heaps of gold , and silver , and diamonds , and silks , and satins ; and on a table there was lying three sets of crowns : a gold crown was in a silver crown , and that was lying in a copper crown . he took up one set of crowns , and gave it to the eldest princess ; and another set , and gave it to the second youngest princess ; and another , and gave it to the youngest of all ; and says he , ' now you may all go to the bottom of the pit , and you have nothing to do but stir the basket , and the people that are watching above will draw you up . but remember , ladies , you are to keep your crows safe , and be married in them , all the same day . if you be married separately , or if you be married without your crowns , a curse will follow -- mind what i say .
