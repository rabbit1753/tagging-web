" brothers , you see their wishes and desires plainly set forth here , " laying his hand upon the figured moose - skins . " the offering is worthy of our consideration . brothers , i see nothing on my part to hinder our granting their requests ; they do not appear to be unreasonable . brothers , the offer is gratifying . it is tobacco -- an article which we have lacked until we scarcely knew how to use our pipes . shall we grant their requests ? one thing more i would say . brothers , it is this : there is my son - in law ; he is mortal . i wish to detain him with me , and it is with us jointly to make him one of us . " " hoke ! hoke ! " ran through the whole company of spirits , and " hoke ! hoke ! " they cried again . and it was understood that the petitioners were to have all they asked , and that wassamo was thenceforward fairly accepted as a member of the great family of spirits . as a wedding - gift , the old spirit asked his son - in - law to make one request , which should be promptly granted . " let there be no sand - squalls among my father 's people for three months to come , " said wassamo . " so shall it be , " answered the old sand - spirit .
