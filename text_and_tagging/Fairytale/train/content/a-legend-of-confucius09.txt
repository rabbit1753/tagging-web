once , when the wicked emperor tsin schi huang had conquered all the other kingdoms , and was traveling through the entire empire , he came to the homeland of confucius . and he found his grave . and , finding his grave , he wished to have it opened and see what was in it . all his officials advised him not to do so , but he would not listen to them . so a passage was dug into the grave , and in its main chamber they found a coffin , whose wood appeared to be quite fresh . when struck it sounded like metal . to the left of the coffin was a door , which led into an inner chamber . in this chamber stood a bed , and a table with books and clothing , all as though meant for the use of a living person . tsin schi huang seated himself on the bed and looked down . and there on the floor stood two shoes of red silk , whose tips were adorned with a woven pattern of clouds . a bamboo staff leaned against the wall . the emperor , in jest , put on the shoes , took the staff and left the grave .
