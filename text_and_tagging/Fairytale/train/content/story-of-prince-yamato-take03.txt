once , many , many years ago , there was born a son to the emperor keiko , the twelfth in descent from the great jimmu , the founder of the japanese dynasty . this prince was the second son of the emperor keiko , and he was named yamato . from his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable strength , wisdom and courage , and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great things , and he loved him even more than he did his elder son . now when prince yamato had grown to manhood ( in the olden days of japanese history , a boy was considered to have reached man 's estate at the early age of sixteen ) the realm was much troubled by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers , kumaso and takeru . these rebels seemed to delight in rebelling against the king , in breaking the laws and defying all authority .
