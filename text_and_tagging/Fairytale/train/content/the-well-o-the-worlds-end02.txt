there was once an old widow woman . who lived in a little cottage with her only daughter , who was such a bonnie lassie that everyone liked to look at her . one day the old woman took a notion into her head to bake a girdleful of cakes . so she took down her bakeboard , and went to the chest and fetched a basinful of meal . when she went to seek a jug of water to mix the meal with , she found that there was none in the house . so she called to her daughter , who was in the garden . when the girl came she held out the empty jug to her , saying , " run , like a good lassie , to the well of the world 's end and bring me a jug of water . i have long found that water from the well of the world 's end makes the best cakes . " so the girl took the jug and set out on her errand . now , as its name shows , it is a long road to that well , and many a weary mile had the poor maid to go before she reached it .
