one day , the sunball having sent her to the straw shed to fetch straw , the girl sat down on the piles of straw and bemoaned herself , saying : ' as sighs this straw under my feet so sighs my heart after my mother . ' and this caused her to be so long away that the sunball asked her , when she came back : ' eh , letiko , where have you been so long ? ' she answered : ' my slippers are too big , and i could not go faster . ' then the sunball made the slippers shorter .
