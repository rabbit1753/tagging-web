when they awoke the sun was high in the heavens , the wood was beautiful in the summer morning , and the birds were flying about in the branches and the tree tops . at first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes . they looked at each other , they looked at their beds , which were of the finest flax covered over with leaves and moss . at last lisa said : ' are you awake , aina ? ' ' yes , ' said aina . ' but i am still dreaming , ' said lisa . ' no , ' said aina , ' but there is certainly some good fairy living among these raspberry bushes . ah , if we had only a hot cup of coffee now , and a nice piece of white bread to dip into it ! '
