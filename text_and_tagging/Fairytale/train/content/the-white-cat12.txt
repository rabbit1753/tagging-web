the queen was in despair , but as night was coming on she ordered that they should encamp just where they were , and went to bed herself , feeling quite ill , she was so disappointed . in the middle of the night she was suddenly awakened , and saw to her surprise a tiny , ugly old woman seated by her bedside , who said to her : ' i must say that we consider it somewhat troublesome of your majesty to insist upon tasting our fruit ; but to save you annoyance , my sisters and i will consent to give you as much as you can carry away , on one condition - that is , that you shall give us your little daughter to bring up as our own . ' ' ah ! my dear madam , ' cried the queen , ' is there nothing else that you will take for the fruit ? i will give you my kingdoms willingly . ' ' no , ' replied the old fairy , ' we will have nothing but your little daughter . she shall be as happy as the day is long , and we will give her everything that is worth having in fairy - land , but you must not see her again until she is married . ' ' though it is a hard condition , ' said the queen , ' i consent , for i shall certainly die if i do not taste the fruit , and so i should lose my little daughter either way . '
