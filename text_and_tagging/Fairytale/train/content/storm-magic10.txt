the captain asked what sort of nonsense this might be , and whether he had ever heard of a cabin - boy 's being entrusted with the command of a ship . but the boy answered that was all one to him ; if they did not care to buy the three cords of birch - wood , and obey him , as though he were captain , for the space of a single day -- the captain and crew should know which day it was to be in advance -- then he would set foot on the ship no more , and far less would he ever dirty his hands with pitch and tar on her again . the whole thing seemed strange to the captain , yet he finally gave in , because he wanted to have the boy along with him and , no doubt , he also thought that he would come to his senses again when they were once under way . the quartermaster was of the same opinion . " just let him command all he likes , and if things go wrong with him , we 'll help him out , " said he . so the birch - wood was bought , full - measure and without haggling , and they set sail .
