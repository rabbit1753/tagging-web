and now came the rogue the third time to the door and knocked . " open , children ! " cried he . " your dear mother has come home , and brought you each something from the wood . " " first show us your paws , " said the kids , " so that we may know if you are really our mother or not . " and he put up his paws against the window , and when they saw that they were white , all seemed right , and they opened the door ; and when he was inside they saw it was the wolf , and they were terrified and tried to hide themselves . one ran under the table , the second got into the bed , the third into the oven , the fourth in the kitchen , the fifth in the cupboard , the sixth under the sink , the seventh in the clock - case . but the wolf found them all , and gave them short shrift ; one after the other he swallowed down , all but the youngest , who was hid in the clock - case . and so the wolf , having got what he wanted , strolled forth into the green meadows , and laying himself down under a tree , he fell asleep .
