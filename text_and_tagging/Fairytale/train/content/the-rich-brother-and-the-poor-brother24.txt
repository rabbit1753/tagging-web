a few hours later the farmer was aroused by the cries and groans of his wife . ' oh , i feel so ill , i 'm sure i 'm going to die , ' wept she . ' it was that onion , i know it was . i wish i had never eaten it . it must have been poisoned . ' ' if the man has poisoned you he shall pay for it , ' said her husband , and seizing a thick stick he ran downstairs and began to beat the poor man , who had been sound asleep , and had nothing to defend himself with . luckily , the noise aroused the younger brother , who jumped up and snatched the stick from the farmer 's hand , saying : ' we are both going to evora to try a law - suit . come too , and accuse him there if he has attempted to rob you or murder you , but do n't kill him now , or you will get yourself into trouble . ' ' well , perhaps you are right , ' answered the farmer , ' but the sooner that fellow has his deserts , the better i shall be pleased , ' and without more words he went to the stables and brought out a horse for himself and also the black andalusian mare ridden by the rich man , while the poor brother , fearing more ill - treatment , started at once on foot .
