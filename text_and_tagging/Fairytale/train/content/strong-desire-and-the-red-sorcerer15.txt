on entering the village , he found that his parents had returned from the place of their spring encampment by the wood - side , and that they were in heavy sorrowing for their son , whom they supposed to be lost . one and another of the young men had presented themselves to the disconsolate parents , and said , " look up , i am your son ; " but when they looked up , they beheld not the familiar face of strong desire . having been often deceived in this manner , when their own son in truth presented himself they sat with their heads down , and with their eyes nearly blinded with weeping . it was some time before they could be prevailed upon to bestow a glance upon him . it was still longer before they could recognize him as their son who had refused to draw water from the river , at night , for fear , for his countenance was no longer that of a timid stripling ; it was that of a man who has seen and done great things , and who has the heart to do greater still .
