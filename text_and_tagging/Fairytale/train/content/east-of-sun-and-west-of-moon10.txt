i do not know exactly all the other things she told them . i do not believe she told them every last thing there was to tell . so in the afternoon , when the family had eaten dinner , it happened as the white bear had foretold . the mother wanted to talk to her daughter alone , in her room . she thought of what the white bear had told her , and did not want to go with her mother , but said : " all we have to say to each other can just as well be said here . " yet she herself did not know exactly how it happened her mother finally did persuade her , and then she had to tell just how things were . so she informed her that as soon as she put out the light at night , a man came and cast himself down in the corner of the room . she had never yet seen him , for he always went away before the dawn brightened . and this grieved her , for she did want to see him so very much , and she was alone through the day , and it was very dreary and lonely .
