one night there flew over the city a little swallow . his friends had gone away to egypt six weeks before , but he had stayed behind , for he was in love with the most beautiful reed . he had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth , and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her . " shall i love you ? " said the swallow , who liked to come to the point at once , and the reed made him a low bow . so he flew round and round her , touching the water with his wings , and making silver ripples . this was his courtship , and it lasted all through the summer . " it is a ridiculous attachment , " twittered the other swallows ; " she has no money , and far too many relations " ; and indeed the river was quite full of reeds . then , when the autumn came they all flew away .
