all else that he learned in the abodes of the dead , and his travels and acts previous to his return homeward , are unknown , for he never spoke of them to any human being . after wandering a long time to gather knowledge to make his people happy and to add to their comfort , he one evening drew near to his own village . passing all the other lodges he came to his own door , where he found the magic arrow , as he had been promised . he heard his brothers from within at high words with each other . they were quarreling for the possession of his wife , who , through all his absence , had remained constant , and sadly awaited his return . maidwa listened in shame and sorrow . he entered the lodge , holding his head aloft as one conscious of good principle and shining with anger . he spoke not a word , but , placing the magic arrow to his bow , he would have laid his brothers dead at his feet ; but just then the talking kettle stepped forward and spoke such words of wisdom , and the singing kettle trolled forth such a soothing little song , and the guilty brothers were so contrite and keenly repentant of their intended wrong , and the red swan was so radiant and forgiving , the silent kettle straightway served them up so hearty and wholesome a meal , and the frisky little kettle was so joyful and danced about so merrily , that when the magic arrows were laid away in the medicine - sack by maidwa , there was that night in all the indian country no happier family than the three brothers , who ever after dwelt together in all kindness , as all good brothers should .
