manawyddan was placing the cross - beam on the two forked sticks , where the mouse was to hang , when a priest rode past . ' good - day to thee , lord ; and what art thou doing ? ' ' i am hanging a thief that i caught robbing me . ' ' what manner of thief , lord ? ' ' a creature in the form of a mouse . it has been robbing me . it shall suffer the doom of a thief . ' ' lord , ' said the priest , ' sooner than see thee touch this reptile , i would purchase its freedom . '
