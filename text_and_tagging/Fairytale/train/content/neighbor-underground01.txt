once upon a time there was a peasant who lived in telemarken , and had a big farm ; yet he had nothing but bad luck with his cattle , and at last lost his house and holding . he had scarcely anything left , and with the little he had , he bought a bit of land that lay off to one side , far away from the city , in the wildwood and the wilderness . one day , as he was passing through his farm - yard , he met a man . " good - day , neighbor ! " said the man . " good - day , " said the peasant , " i thought i was all alone here . are you a neighbor of mine ? " " you can see my homestead over yonder , " said the man . " it is not far from your own . " and there lay a farm - holding such as he had never before seen , handsome and prosperous , and in fine condition . then he knew very well that this must be one of the underground people ; yet he had no fear , but invited his neighbor in to drink a glass with him , and the neighbor seemed to enjoy it .
