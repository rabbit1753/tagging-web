it was not long after this that setanta received the name by which he is more generally known . culain was chief of the black country of ulla , and of a people altogether given up to the making of weapons and armour , where the sound of the hammer and husky bellows were for ever heard . one day conchubar and some of his knights , passing through the park to partake of an entertainment at the house of the armourer , paused awhile , looking at the boys at play . then , as all were praising his little nephew , conchubar called to him , and the boy came up , flushed and shy , for there were with the king the chief warriors of the red branch . but conchubar bade him come with them to the feast , and the knights around him laughed , and enumerated the good things which culain had prepared for them . but when setanta 's brow fell , conchubar bade him finish his game , and after that proceed to culain 's house , which was to the west of emain macha , and more than a mile distant from the city . then the king and his knights went on to the feast , and setanta returned joyfully to his game . now , when they were seen afar upon the plain the smith left his workshop and put by his implements , and having washed from him the sweat and smoke , made himself ready to receive his guests ; but the evening fell as they were coming into the liss , and all his people came in also , and sat at the lower table , and the bridge was drawn up and the door was shut for the night , and the candles were lit in the high chamber .
