i can not draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket , because it was quite dark , and because the smell of onions was fearful ; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry . the sun got round behind the wood , and it was quite late in the afternoon ; but still the cat sat upon the basket . at length there was a pitter - patter , pitter - patter , and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above . the cat looked up and saw old mr . benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace . he was smoking a pipe of rabbit - tobacco , and had a little switch in his hand . he was looking for his son.v
