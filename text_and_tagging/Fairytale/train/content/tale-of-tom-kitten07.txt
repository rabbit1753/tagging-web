tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers . he came up the rockery by degrees , breaking the ferns , and shedding buttons right and left . he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall . moppet and mittens tried to pull him together ; his hat fell off , and the rest of his buttons burst . while they were in difficulties , there was a pit pat paddle pat ! and the three puddle - ducks came along the hard high road , marching one behind the other and doing the goose step - pit pat paddle pat ! pit pat waddle pat ! they stopped and stood in a row , and stared up at the kittens . they had very small eyes and looked surprised .
