there was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter , and when she was grown up he became anxious that she should be well married and taken care of ; so he thought , " if a decent sort of man comes and asks her in marriage , i will give her to him . " soon after a suitor came forward who seemed very well to do , and as the miller knew nothing to his disadvantage , he promised him his daughter . but the girl did not seem to love him as a bride should love her bridegroom ; she had no confidence in him ; as often as she saw him or thought about him , she felt a chill at her heart . one day he said to her , " you are to be my bride , and yet you have never been to see me . " the girl answered , " i do not know where your house is . " then he said , " my house is a long way in the wood . "
