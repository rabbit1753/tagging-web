" i am not that blessed lady , as thou thinkest , " she said . " men call me queen , but it is of a far other country ; for i am the queen of fairy - land , and not the queen of heaven . " and certainly it seemed as if what she said were true ; for , from that moment , it was as if a spell were cast over thomas , making him forget prudence , and caution , and common - sense itself . for he knew that it was dangerous for mortals to meddle with fairies , yet he was so entranced with the lady 's beauty that he begged her to give him a kiss . this was just what she wanted , for she knew that if she once kissed him she had him in her power .
