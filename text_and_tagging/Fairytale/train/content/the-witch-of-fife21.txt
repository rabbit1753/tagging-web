" as soon as they heard that , the men servants cried out that he was a warlock , and they dragged him before the bishop , and , as bishops in those days had a holy horror of warlocks and witches , he ordered him to be burned alive . when the sentence was pronounced , you may be very sure that the poor old man wished with all his heart that he had stayed quietly at home in bed , and never hankered after the bishop 's wine . but it was too late to wish that now , for the servants dragged him out into the courtyard , and put a chain round his waist , and fastened it to a great iron stake , and they piled faggots of wood round his feet and set them alight .
