in the meantime finn was very melancholy , and did not know what to do , or how to act at all . far rua was an ugly customer , no doubt , to meet with ; and , moreover , the idea of the confounded " cake " aforesaid flattened the very heart within him . what chance could he have , strong and brave as he was , with a man who could , when put in a passion , walk the country into earthquakes and knock thunderbolts into pancakes ? the thing was impossible , and finn knew not on what hand to turn him . right or left , backward or forward , where to go he could form no guess whatever . " oonagh , " said he , " can you do anything for me ? where 's all your invention ? am i to be skivered like a rabbit before your eyes and to have my name disgraced for ever in the sight of all my tribe , and me the best man among them ? how am i to fight this man - mountain -- this huge cross between an earthquake and a thunderbolt -- with a pancake in his pocket that was once---- ? " " be aisy , finn , " replied oonagh . " troth , i 'm ashamed of you . keep your toe in your pump , will you ? talking of pancakes , maybe we 'll give him as good as any he brings with him -- thunderbolts or otherwise . if i do n't treat him to as smart feeding as he 's got this many a day , do n't trust oonagh again . leave him to me , and do just as i bid you .
