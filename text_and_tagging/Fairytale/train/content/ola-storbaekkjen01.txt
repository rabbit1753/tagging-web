once upon a time there lived a man in the forest of dovre whose name was ola storbaekkjen . he was of giant build , powerful and fearless . during the winter he did not work , but traveled from one fair to another , hunting up quarrels and brawls . from christiansmarkt he went to branaes and konigsberg , and thence to grundsaet , and wherever he came squabbles and brawls broke out , and in every brawl he was the victor . in the summer he dealt in cattle at valders and the fjords , and fought with the fjord - folk and the hill people of halling and valders , and always had the best of it . but sometimes they scratched him a bit with the knife , did those folk .
