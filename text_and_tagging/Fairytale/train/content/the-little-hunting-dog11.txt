not long after the king got into a small chariot and his bodyguards saddled their horses with the greatest rapidity . then they galloped out with great cries of homage , till it looked as though some one were scattering beans and a heavy cloud of dust rose behind them . they had nearly all of them disappeared , while the scholar 's eyes were still fixed on them full of terror and astonishment , and he could not imagine whence they had come . he slipped on his shoes and looked ; but they had vanished without a trace . then he returned and looked all about his room ; but there was nothing to be seen . only , on a brick against the wall , they had forgotten a little hunting dog . the scholar quickly caught it and found it quite tame . he put it in his paint - box and examined it closely . it had a very smooth , fine coat , and wore a little collar around its neck .
