the young fellow said it was not worth quarreling about such things , and that he had better shoes and better canes at home . " you can not say that , " returned the brothers , " for whoever has these shoes on can cover a thousand miles in a single step , and whatever is touched with this cane must die at once . " the young fellow went on to ask whether they would sell the things . they said that they ought to get a great deal for them . " but what you say of them is not true at all , " the young fellow replied . " yes , indeed , it is absolutely true , " they answered . " just let me see whether the boots will fit me , " said the young fellow . so they let him try them on . but no sooner did the young fellow have the boots on his feet , and the cane in his hand , than he took a step and off he was , a thousand miles away . a little later he met two young fellows who were quarreling over an old fiddle , which had been left them . " now is that worth while doing ? " said the young fellow . " i have a brand - new fiddle at home . " " but i doubt if it has such a tone as ours , " said one of the youths , " for if some one is dead , and you play this fiddle , he will come to life again . " " that really is a good deal , " said the young fellow . " may i draw the bow across the strings ? " they told him he might , but no sooner did he have the fiddle in his hand than he took a step , and suddenly he was a thousand miles away .
