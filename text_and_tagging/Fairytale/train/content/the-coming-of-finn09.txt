as midnight drew nigh , he heard far away in the north , out of the mountains of slieve gullion , a fairy tune played , soft , low , and slow , as if on a silver flute ; and at the same time the roar of conn the hundred - fighter , and the voice of gaul like thunder , and the responsive shouts of the captains , and the clamour of the host , for the host shouted all together , and clashed their swords against their shields in fierce defiance , when in spite of all obstructions the fairy music of the enchanter began to steal into their souls . that shout was heard all over ireland , echoing from sea to sea , and the hollow buildings of tara reverberated to the uproar . yet through it all could be heard the low , slow , delicious music that came from slieve gullion . finn put the point of the spear to his forehead . it burned him like fire , yet his stout heart did not fail . then the roar of the host slowly faded away as in a dream , though the captains were still shouting , and two - thirds of the torches fell to the ground .
