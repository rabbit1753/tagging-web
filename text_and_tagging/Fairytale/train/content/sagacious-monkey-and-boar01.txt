long , long ago , there lived in the province of shinshin in japan , a traveling monkey - man , who earned his living by taking round a monkey and showing off the animal 's tricks . one evening the man came home in a very bad temper and told his wife to send for the butcher the next morning . the wife was very bewildered and asked her husband : " why do you wish me to send for the butcher ? " " it 's no use taking that monkey round any longer , he 's too old and forgets his tricks . i beat him with my stick all i know how , but he wo n't dance properly . i must now sell him to the butcher and make what money out of him i can . there is nothing else to be done .
