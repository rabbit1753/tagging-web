once upon a time there were three little kittens , and their names were mittens , tom kitten , and moppet . they had dear little fur coats of their own ; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust . but one day their mother - mrs . tabitha twitchit - expected friends to tea ; so she fetched the kittens indoors , to wash and dress them , before the fine company arrived .
