one day the hunter had gone abroad with his bow and arrows , leaving , at the request of the strange boy , one of the two shafts which the friendly weendigo had given to him , behind in the lodge . when he returned , what were his surprise and joy to see stretched dead by his lodge - door , the black giant who had slain his wife . he had been stricken down by the magic shaft in the hands of the little stranger from the tree ; and ever after the boy , or the bone - dwarf as he was called , was the guardian and good genius of the lodge , and no evil spirit , giant , or weendigo , dared approach it to mar their peace .
