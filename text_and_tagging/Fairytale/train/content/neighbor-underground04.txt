when the peasant heard that , he went right to work pulling down his stable , to put it up again in another place . yet he could not have worked alone , for at night , when all slept , the building of the new stable went forward just as it did by day , and well he knew his neighbor was helping him . nor did he regret it later , for he had enough of feed and corn , and his cattle waxed fat . once there was a year of scarcity , and feed was so short that he was thinking of selling or slaughtering half his herd . but one morning , when the milk - maid went into the stable , the dog was gone , and with him all the cows and the calves . she began to cry and told the peasant . but he thought to himself , that it was probably his neighbor 's doings , who had taken the cattle to pasture . and sure enough , so it was ; for toward spring , when the woods grew green , he saw the dog come along , barking and leaping , by the edge of the forest , and after him followed all the cows and calves , and the whole herd was so fat it was a pleasure to look at it .
