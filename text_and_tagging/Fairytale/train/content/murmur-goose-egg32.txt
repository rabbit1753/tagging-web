" let 's see who you may be ? perhaps you are an old friend of mine , " said murmur . and sure enough , it was master devil . then they played cards together . the devil would gladly have won back some of the tribute murmur had forced from his grandmother for the king . yet , no matter how he played , murmur always won ; for he made a cross on the cards . and after he had won all the devil had with him , the latter had to give him some of the gold and silver that was in the castle . in the midst of their game the fire went out , so that they could no longer tell the cards apart . " now we must split wood , " said murmur . he hewed into the block of pine - wood with his ax , and drove in the wedge , but the tree - stump was tough , and would not split at once , though murmur gave himself all manner of pains . " you are supposed to be strong , " he said to the devil . " spit on your hands , slap in your claws here , and pull the block apart , so that i can see what you can do ! "
