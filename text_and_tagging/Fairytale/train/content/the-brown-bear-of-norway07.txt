' my dear , ' said she to her husband , when she was beginning to recover , ' i think i 'd feel better if i was to see my father and mother and sisters once more . if you give me leave to go home for a few days i 'd be glad . ' ' very well , ' said he , ' i will do that , and whenever you feel inclined to return , only mention your wish when you lie down at night . ' the next morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her father 's palace . she rang the bell , and in a short time she had her mother and father and married sisters about her , and they laughed till they cried for joy at finding her safe back again .
