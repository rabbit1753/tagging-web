" and what wisdom have you learned ? " said the councillor . oh ! boots had learned wisdom about everything in the world . he had learned that the clever scamp who had fooled the king yesterday was coming with seventeen tall men to take the high - councillor , willy - nilly , to the castle that morning . when the high - councillor heard this he fell to trembling till his teeth rattled in his head . " and have you learned how i can get the better of this clever scamp ? " said he . oh , yes ! boots had learned that easily enough . so , good ! then if the wise man in the sack would tell the high - councillor how to escape the clever rogue , the high - councillor would give the wise man twenty dollars . but no , that was not to be done ; wisdom was not bought so cheaply as the high - councillor seemed to think . well , the councillor would give him a hundred dollars then . that was good ! a hundred dollars were a hundred dollars . if the councillor would give him that much he might get into the sack himself , and then he could learn all the wisdom that he wanted , and more besides .
