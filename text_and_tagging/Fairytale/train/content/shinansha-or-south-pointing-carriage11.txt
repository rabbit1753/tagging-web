this little incident made the clever emperor think that he might try to make something that could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over the spider . he set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat . when he found that it was a success he set all his men to make more , and in time there were enough boats for the whole army . kotei now took his army across the river , and attacked shiyu 's headquarters . he gained a complete victory , and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long .
