" i 'm not asking anything at all except the loan of the sword that 's under your bed , " says he . " i give it to you , and welcome , " says the giant . he went in , and brought out the sword with him . " try it on the three biggest trees that are in the wood , and you wo n't feel it in your hand going through them , " says the giant . " i do n't see any tree in the wood bigger or uglier than yourself , " says he , drawing the sword and whipping the head off him , so that he sent it seven furrows and seven ridges with that stroke . " if i were to get on the body again , " said the head , and it talking , " and the men of the world would n't get me off the trunk again . " " i 'll take good care myself of that , " says the lad . when he drove the cows home in the evening , they had that much milk that they had not half enough of vessels , and two coopers were obliged to make new vessels to hold the quantity of milk they had . " you 're the best lad that ever i met , " says the gentleman , and he was thankful to him .
