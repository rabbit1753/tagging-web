then thomas took courage , and looked up ; and lo , they were riding through a beautiful orchard , where apples and pears , dates and figs and wine - berries grew in great abundance . and his tongue was so parched and dry , and he felt so faint , that he longed for some of the fruit to restore him . he stretched out his hand to pluck some of it ; but his companion turned in her saddle and forbade him . " there is nothing safe for thee to eat here , " she said , " save an apple , which i will give thee presently . if thou touch aught else thou art bound to remain in fairy - land for ever . " so poor thomas had to restrain himself as best he could ; and they rode slowly on , until they came to a tiny tree all covered with red apples . the fairy queen bent down and plucked one , and handed it to her companion . " this i can give thee , " she said , " and i do it gladly , for these apples are the apples of truth ; and whoso eateth them gaineth this reward , that his lips will never more be able to frame a lie . " thomas took the apple , and ate it ; and for evermore the grace of truth rested on his lips ; and that is why , in after years , men called him " true thomas . " they had only a little way to go after this , before they came in sight of a magnificent castle standing on a hillside . " yonder is my abode , " said the queen , pointing to it proudly . " there dwelleth my lord and all the nobles of his court ; and , as my lord hath an uncertain temper and shows no liking for any strange gallant whom he sees in my company , i pray thee , both for thy sake and mine , to utter no word to anyone who speaketh to thee ; and , if anyone should ask me who and what thou art , i will tell them that thou art dumb . so wilt thou pass unnoticed in the crowd .
