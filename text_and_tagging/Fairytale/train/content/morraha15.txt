the hag brought them out of the room . i said i would burn the flesh that was on his arm . when i looked on him he was howling with pain . i said that i would not leave him in pain long . the thief had only one eye in his forehead . i took a bar of iron , and put it in the fire till it was red , and i said to the hag , " he will be howling at first , but will fall asleep presently , and do not wake him until he has slept as much as he wants . i will close the door when i am going out . " i took the bar with me , and i stood over him , and i turned it across through his eye as far as i could . he began to bellow , and tried to catch me , but i was out and away , having closed the door . the hag asked me , " why is he bellowing ? " " oh , he will be quiet presently , and will sleep for a good while , and i 'll come again to have a look at him . bring me out the young men and the young women . " i took them with me , and i said to her , " tell me where you got them . " " oh , my son brought them with him , and they are the offspring of the one king . " i was well satisfied , and i had no liking for delay to get myself free from the hag , and i took them on board the ship , and the child i had myself . i thought the king might leave me the child i nursed myself . but when i came to land , and all those young people with me , the king and queen were out walking . the king was very aged , and the queen aged likewise . when i came to converse with them , and the twelve with me , the king and queen began to cry . i asked , " why are you crying ?
