as often as he wearied of climbing , for even a squirrel can not climb forever , he repeated the little ceremony of the bones ; but whenever he came near the lodge and put forth his hand to touch it , the tree would shoot up as before , and carry the lodge up far beyond his reach . at length the bones being all gone , and the lodge well - nigh out of sight , he began to despair , for the earth , too , had long since vanished entirely from his view . summoning his whole heart , he resolved to try once more . on and up he went , and , as soon as he put forth his hand to touch it , the tree again shook , and away went the lodge . one more endeavor , brave onwee , and in he goes ; for having now reached the arch of heaven , the fly - away lodge could go no higher . onwee entered the lodge with a fearless step , and he beheld the two wicked sisters sitting opposite each other . he asked their names . the one on his left hand called herself azhabee , and the one on the right , negahnabee .
