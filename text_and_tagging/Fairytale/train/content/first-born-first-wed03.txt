while these negotiations were being conducted , it began to be said that the sea - shore was haunted . various people had heard cries , and several who had walked by the sea - shore late in the evening had fallen ill . at length no one ventured to go there . after eleven at night , because a voice kept crying from out at sea : " first born , first we d ! " and when some one did venture nearer he did so at the risk of his life . at last these complaints came to the king 's ear . he called together his council , and it was decided to question a wise woman , who had already foretold many mysterious happenings , which had all taken place exactly as she had said they would . when the wise woman was brought before the king she said it was the prince who had been taken into the sea who was calling , and that they would have to find him a bride , young , beautiful , and belonging to one of the noblest families of the land , and she must be no less than fifteen and no more than seventeen years old . that seemed a serious difficulty ; for no one wished to give their daughter to a sea - king .
