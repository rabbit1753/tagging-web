the young man began his journey , and soon arrived at a place where four roads met . he did not know which to choose , and tossed his cap in the air , determining that the direction of its fall should decide him . after travelling for two or three days , he grew tired of walking without knowing where or for how long , and he stopped at an inn which was filled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drink . ' my faith , ' said he , ' it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting for this bird . my father is old , and if he dies i shall inherit his goods . '
