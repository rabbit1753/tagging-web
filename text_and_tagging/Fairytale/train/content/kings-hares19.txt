she was stingier , and only offered fifty dollars ; but she had to raise her bid until she reached three hundred . esben said it was a magnificent whistle , and that the price was a beggarly one ; but seeing that she was the queen , he would let it pass . she was to pay him three hundred dollars , and for every dollar she was to give him a buss to boot , then she should have the whistle . and he was paid in full as agreed , since as regards the busses the queen was not so stingy . when she had the whistle in her hands , she tied it fast , and hid it well , but she fared not a whit better than either of the others . when she wanted to show the whistle it was gone , and in the evening esben came home , driving his hares as though they were a well - trained flock of sheep . this was conceded him , and thus he obtained the whistle . he put it in the purse in his pocket , and carefully buttoned up the pocket . yet when he reached the castle , and wanted to take it out , he was in the same case as the women , for he no longer had the whistle . and in the evening esben came home with his herd of hares , and not the least little hare was missing . the king was angry , and furious because he had made a fool of them all , and had swindled the king 's self out of the whistle into the bargain , and now he wanted to do away with esben . the queen was of the same opinion , and said it was best to behead such a knave when he was caught in the act .
