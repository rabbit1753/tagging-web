the poor dog , who was lying stretched out in the sun not far off , heard all they said , and was very sad to think that the next day would be his last . he bethought him of his great friend the wolf , and slipped out in the evening to the wood to see him , and related to him the fate that was awaiting him . " listen to me , old fellow , " said the wolf ; " be of good courage , i will help you in your need . i have thought of a way . early to - morrow morning your master is going hay - making with his wife , and they will take their child with them , so that no one will be left at home . they will be sure to lay the child in the shade behind the hedge while they are at work ; you must lie by its side , just as if you were watching it . then i will come out of the wood and steal away the child ; you must rush after me , as if to save it from me . then i must let it fall , and you must bring it back again to its parents , who will think that you have saved it , and will be much too grateful to do you any harm ; on the contrary , you will be received into full favour , and they will never let you want for anything again .
