" regret not , my father , the change you behold . i shall be happier in my present state than i could have been as a man . i shall always be the friend of men , and keep near their dwellings . i shall ever be happy and contented ; and although i could not gratify your wishes as a warrior , it will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace and joy . i will cheer you by my songs , and strive to inspire in others the joy and lightsomeness of heart i feel in my present state . this will be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected . i am now free from the cares and pains of human life . my food is spontaneously furnished by the mountains and fields , and my pathway of life is in the bright air . " then stretching himself on his toes , as if delighted with the gift of wings , iadilla caroled one of his sweetest songs , and flew away into a neighboring wood .
