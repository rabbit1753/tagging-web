" i am waited for in egypt , " said the swallow . " my friends are flying up and down the nile , and talking to the large lotus - flowers . soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great king . the king is there himself in his painted coffin . he is wrapped in yellow linen , and embalmed with spices . round his neck is a chain of pale green jade , and his hands are like withered leaves . " " swallow , swallow , little swallow , " said the prince , " will you not stay with me for one night , and be my messenger ? the boy is so thirsty , and the mother so sad . " " i do n't think i like boys , " answered the swallow . " last summer , when i was staying on the river , there were two rude boys , the miller 's sons , who were always throwing stones at me . they never hit me , of course ; we swallows fly far too well for that , and besides , i come of a family famous for its agility ; but still , it was a mark of disrespect . " but the happy prince looked so sad that the little swallow was sorry . " it is very cold here , " he said ; " but i will stay with you for one night , and be your messenger . "
