she began to make excuses , and said she could not find the way to it ; but the bridegroom said , " you must come and pay me a visit next sunday ; i have already invited company , and i will strew ashes on the path through the wood , so that you will be sure to find it . " when sunday came , and the girl set out on her way , she felt very uneasy without knowing exactly why ; and she filled both pockets full of peas and lentils . there were ashes strewed on the path through the wood , but , nevertheless , at each step she cast to the right and left a few peas on the ground . so she went on the whole day until she came to the middle of the wood , where it was the darkest , and there stood a lonely house , not pleasant in her eyes , for it was dismal and unhomelike . she walked in , but there was no one there , and the greatest stillness reigned . suddenly she heard a voice cry , " turn back , turn back , thou pretty bride , within this house thou must not bide , for here do evil things betide .
