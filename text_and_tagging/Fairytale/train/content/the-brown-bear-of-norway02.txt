but that very night she woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with a thousand lamps ; the richest carpets were on the floor , and the walls were covered with cloth of gold and silver , and the place was full of grand company , and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was there , and it was n't a moment till he was on one knee before her , and telling her how much he loved her , and asking her would n't she be his queen . well , she had n't the heart to refuse him , and married they were the same evening . ' now , my darling , ' says he , when they were left by themselves , ' you must know that i am under enchantment . a sorceress , that had a beautiful daughter , wished me for her son - in - law ; but the mother got power over me , and when i refused to we d her daughter she made me take the form of a bear by day , and i was to continue so till a lady would marry me of her own free will , and endure five years of great trials after .
