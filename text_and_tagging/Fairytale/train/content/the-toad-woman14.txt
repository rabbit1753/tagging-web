great good luck once happened to a young woman who was living all alone in the woods with nobody near her but her little dog ; for , to her surprise , she found fresh meat every morning at her door . she was very curious to know who it was that supplied her , and watching one morning , just as the sun had risen , she saw a handsome young man gliding away into the forest . having seen her , he became her husband , and she had a son by him . one day , not long after this , he did not return at evening , as usual , from hunting . she waited till late at night , but he came no more . the next day , she swung her child to sleep in its cradle , and then said to her dog , " take care of your brother while i am gone , and when he cries , halloo for me . " the cradle was made of the finest wampum , and all its bandages and ornaments were of the same precious stuff .
