no sooner had he finished speaking than there they stood ; but then he was very much upset , for now he remembered what they had told him . at the castle they gave a great feast in honor of the princesses , and made a great deal of them . but they would not stay . " we want to go to your parents , " they said to halvor , " and then we want to go out and look around . " he went with them , and they came to a big sheet of water beyond the court - yard . close beside it was a fair green hill , and there the princesses decided to sit and rest a while , " for it was so pleasant to look out over the water , " said they . they sat down , and after they had rested a while , the youngest princess said : " let me stroke your hair a little , halvor ! " halvor laid his head in her lap , and she stroked his hair , and before very long halvor fell asleep . then she drew the ring from his finger , and gave him another in place of it , and said : " all hold on to me -- i wish we were in soria - moria castle !
