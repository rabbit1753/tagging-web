those who hold it are too powerful for the magician , and many have sacrificed themselves to recover it for him , but without success . the red swan has enticed many a young man , as she has you , to enlist them to procure the scalp , and whoever is so fortunate as to succeed , it is understood , will receive the red swan as his reward . in the morning you will proceed on your way , and toward evening you will come to this magician 's lodge . you will know it by the groans which you will hear far over the prairie as you approach . he will ask you in . you will see no one but himself . he will question you much as to your dreams and the strength of your guardian spirits . if he is satisfied with your answers , he will urge you to attempt the recovery of his scalp . he will show you the course to take , and if you feel inclined , as i see that you do , go forward , my son , with a strong heart ; persevere , and i have a presentiment that you will succeed .
