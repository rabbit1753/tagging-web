the man was rather surprised at first , as he felt particularly well that evening ; but the moment his wife spoke he became quite certain that he had something dreadful the matter with him , and grew quite pale . ' i dare say it would be the best place for me , ' he answered , trembling ; and he suffered his wife to take him upstairs , and to help him off with his clothes . ' if you sleep well during the might there may be a chance for you , ' said she , shaking her head , as she tucked him up warmly ; ' but if not-- ' and of course the poor man never closed an eye till the sun rose . ' how do you feel this morning ? ' asked the woman , coming in on tip - toe when her house - work was finished . ' oh , bad ; very bad indeed , ' answered he ; ' i have not slept for a moment . can you think of nothing to make me better ? '
