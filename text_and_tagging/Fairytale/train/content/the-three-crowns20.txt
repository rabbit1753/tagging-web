so they took leave of him with great respect , and walked arm - in - arm to the bottom of the draw - well . there was a sky and a sun over them , and a great high wall , covered with ivy , rose before them , and was so high they could not see to the top of it ; and there was an arch in this wall , and the bottom of the draw - well was inside the arch . the youngest pair went last ; and says the princess to the prince , ' i 'm sure the two princes do n't mean any good to you . keep these crowns under your cloak , and if you are obliged to stay last , do n't get into the basket , but put a big stone , or any heavy thing inside , and see what will happen . ' as soon as they were inside the dark cave , they put in the eldest princess first , and stirred the basket , and up she went . then the basket was let down again , and up went the second princess , and then up went the youngest ; but first she put her arms round her prince 's neck , and kissed him , and cried a little . at last it came to the turn of the youngest prince , and instead of going into the basket he put in a big stone . he drew on one side and listened , and after the basket was drawn up about twenty perches , down came it and the stone like thunder , and the stone was broken into little bits .
