once upon a time there was a man who lived in the little back room . he had given up his estate to the heir . but in addition he had three sons , who were named peter , paul and esben , who was the youngest . all three hung around at home and would not work , for they had it too easy . they thought themselves too good for anything like work , and nothing was good enough for them . finally peter once heard that the king wanted a shepherd for his hares , and he told his father he would apply for the position , as it would just suit him , seeing that he wished to serve no one lower in rank than the king . his father , it is true , was of the opinion that there might be other work that would suit him better , for whoever was to herd hares would have to be quick and spry , and not a sleepy - head . when the hares took to their heels in all directions , it was a dance of another kind than when one skipped about a room . but it was of no use . peter insisted , and would have his own way , took his knapsack , and shambled down hill . after he had gone a while , he saw an old woman who had got her nose wedged in a tree - stump while chopping wood , and when peter saw her jerking and pulling away , trying to get out , he burst into loud laughter .
