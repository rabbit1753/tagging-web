the old people were very active and industrious ; they were never idle for even a single hour . on sunday afternoons they would bring out some books , generally a book of travels which they greatly liked . the old man would read aloud about africa , with its great forests and the wild elephants , while his wife would listen attentively , stealing a glance now and then at the clay elephants which served as flowerpots . " i can almost imagine i am seeing it all , " she said . ah ! how the lamp wished for a wax taper to be lighted in it , for then the old woman would have seen the smallest detail as clearly as it did itself ; the lofty trees , with their thickly entwined branches , the naked negroes on horseback , and whole herds of elephants treading down bamboo thickets with their broad , heavy feet .
