when it was out of sight , a voice from the pot said : ' uncover me , ' and she lifted the lid , and the little grey snake slid rapidly to the ground . ' i am safe now , ' he said . ' but tell me , where are you going ? ' ' i can not tell you , for i do not know , ' she answered . ' i am just wandering in the wood . ' ' follow me , and let us go home together , ' said the snake , and the girl followed his through the forest and along the green paths , till they came to a great lake , where they stopped to rest . ' the sun is hot , ' said the snake , ' and you have walked far . take your baby and bathe in that cool place where the boughs of the tree stretch far over the water . ' ' yes , i will , ' answered she , and they went in . the baby splashed and crowed with delight , and then he gave a spring and fell right in , down , down , down , and his mother could not find him , though she searched all among the reeds .
