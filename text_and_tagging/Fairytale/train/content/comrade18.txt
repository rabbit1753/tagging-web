" the youth thought it would not be so very hard , and put the ball of gold twine in his pocket . yet the princess once more began to toy and joke with him , so that he thought neither of himself nor of the ball of gold twine , and while they were in the midst of their merry play she stole the golden ball from him , and then dismissed him . when he came up into his room , and told what she had said and done , his comrade asked : " and have you still the ball of gold twine ?
