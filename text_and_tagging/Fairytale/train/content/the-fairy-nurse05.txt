the dark man did n't once cast his eye towards molly , and he seemed to have no suspicion of me . when we came out i looked about me , and where do you think we were but in the dyke of the rath of cromogue . i was on the horse again , which was nothing but a big rag - weed , and i was in dread every minute i 'd fall off ; but nothing happened till i found myself in my own cabin . the king slipped five guineas into my hand as soon as i was on the ground , and thanked me , and bade me good night . i hope i 'll never see his face again . i got into bed , and could n't sleep for a long time ; and when i examined my five guineas this morning , that i left in the table drawer the last thing , i found five withered leaves of oak -- bad luck to the giver ! well , you may all think the fright , and the joy , and the grief the poor man was in when the woman finished her story . they talked and they talked , but we need n't mind what they said till friday night came , when both were standing where the mountain road crosses the one going to ross .
