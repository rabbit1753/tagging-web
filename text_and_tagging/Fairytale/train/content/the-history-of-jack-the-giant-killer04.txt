another giant , called blunderbore , vowed to be revenged on jack if ever he should have him in his power . this giant kept an enchanted castle in the midst of a lonely wood ; and some time after the death of cormoran jack was passing through a wood , and being weary , sat down and went to sleep . the giant , passing by and seeing jack , carried him to his castle , where he locked him up in a large room , the floor of which was covered with the bodies , skulls and bones of men and women .
