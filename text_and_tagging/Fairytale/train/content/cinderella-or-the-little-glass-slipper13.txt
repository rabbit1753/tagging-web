as she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball , her two sisters knocked at the door , which cinderella ran and opened . " how long you have stayed ! " cried she , gaping , rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep ; she had not , however , any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home . " if you had been at the ball , " said one of her sisters , " you would not have been tired with it . there came there the finest princess , the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes ; she showed us a thousand civilities , and gave us oranges and citrons . " cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter ; indeed , she asked them the name of that princess ; but they told her they did not know it , and that the king 's son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was . at this cinderella , smiling , replied : " she must , then , be very beautiful indeed ; how happy you have been ! could not i see her ? ah ! dear miss charlotte , do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day . " " ay , to be sure ! " cried miss charlotte ; " lend my clothes to such a dirty cinderwench as you are ! i should be a fool . " cinderella , indeed , expected well such answer , and was very glad of the refusal ; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly .
