the following morning the bailiff came by . he was much surprised to see the little golden hut , glittering and sparkling there in the forest , and was still more surprised at the girl within the hut . he fell in love with her at once , and asked her whether she would not become the bailiff 's lady . " yes , but have you plenty of money ? " said the master girl . yes , he had quite a little , said the bailiff . then he went home to fetch his money , and came back again at evening dragging along an enormous sack of it , which he stood on a bench before the door . the master girl said that , seeing he had so much money , she would accept him . and then she asked him to rake the fire , which she said she had forgotten to do . but as soon as he had the poker in his hand , the master girl cried : " may god grant that you hold the poker , and the poker hold you , and that sparks and ashes fly around you until morning ! " and there the bailiff stood the whole night through , and sparks and ashes flew about him , nor were the sparks the less hot for all his complaining and begging . and when morning came , and he could let go the poker , he did not stay long ; but ran off as though the evil one were at his heels . and those who saw him stared and laughed , for he ran like a madman , and looked as though he had been thrashed and tanned . and all would have liked to have known where he had come from , but he said not a word , for he was ashamed .
