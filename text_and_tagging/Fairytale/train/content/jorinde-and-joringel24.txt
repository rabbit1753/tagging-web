he plucked this flower and went with it to the castle ; and there everything which he touched with the flower was freed from the enchantment , and he got his jorinde back again through it . when he awoke in the morning he began to seek mountain and valley to find such a flower . he sought it for eight days , and on the ninth early in the morning he found the blood - red flower . in its centre was a large dew - drop , as big as the most lovely pearl . he travelled day and night with this flower till he arrived at the castle . when he came within a hundred paces of it he did not cease to be able to move , but he went on till he reached the gate . whilst he was considering , he observed the old witch take up a cage secretly and go with it towards the door . instantly he sprang after her , touched the cage with the flower , and the old woman as well . now she could no longer work enchantments , and there stood jorinde before him , with her arms round his neck , and more beautiful than ever . then he turned all the other birds again into maidens , and he went home with his jorinde , and they lived a long and happy life .
