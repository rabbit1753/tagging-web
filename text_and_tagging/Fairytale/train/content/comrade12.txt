after they had again wandered on for a few days , the comrade said : " now we will soon reach the castle in which she lives , the princess of whom you dreamed , and when we reach it , you must go to the castle and tell the king what you dreamed , and your journey 's aim . " when they got there , the youth did as he was told , and was very well received . he was given a room for himself , and one for his servant , and when it was time to eat , he was invited to the king 's own table . when he saw the princess , he recognized her at once as the vision of his dream . he told her , too , why he was there , and she replied that she liked him quite well , and would gladly take him , but first he must undergo three tests . when they had eaten , she gave him a pair of gold shears and said : " the first test is that you take these shears and keep them , and give them back to me to - morrow noon . that is not a very severe test , " she said , and smiled , " but , if you can not stand it , you must die , as the law demands , and you will be in the same case as the suitors whose bones you may see lying without the castle gate .
