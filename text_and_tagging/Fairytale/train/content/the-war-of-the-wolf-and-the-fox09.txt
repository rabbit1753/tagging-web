when susan saw this she said to her husband , ' just look , here is our old cat back again , and see what a lot of mice she has caught . ' ' wonders will never cease , ' cried simon . ' i certainly never thought the old cat would ever catch another mouse . ' but susan answered , ' there , you see , i always said our cat was a most excellent creature -- but you men always think you know best . ' in the meantime the fox said to the dog , ' our friend simon has just killed a pig . when it gets a little darker , you must go into the courtyard and bark with all your might . ' ' all right , ' said the dog , and as soon as it grew dusk he began to bark loudly .
