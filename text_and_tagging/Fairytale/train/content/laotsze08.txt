when they came to the house of the guardian of the pass , red clouds appeared in the sky . the guardian understood this sign and knew that a holy man was drawing near . so he went out to meet him and took him into his house . he questioned him with regard to hidden knowledge , but laotsze only stuck out his tongue at him and would not say a word . nevertheless , the guardian of the pass treated him with the greatest respect in his home . laotsze 's servant told the servant of the guardian that his master owed him a great deal of money , and begged the latter to put in a good word for him . then the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth and pleaded for him . he promised to pay the servant for laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life . so laotsze placed the talisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again . the guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him . then he adored laotsze as his master , and the latter taught him the art of eternal life , and left him his teachings , in five thousand words , which the guardian wrote down . the book which thus came into being is the tao teh king , " the book of the way and life . " laotsze then disappeared from the eyes of men . the guardian of the pass however , followed his teachings , and was given a place among the immortals .
