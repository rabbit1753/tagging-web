there was once a farmer who lived in great comfort . he had both lands and money , but , though he was so well off , one thing was wanting to complete his happiness ; he had no children . many and many a time , when he met other farmers at the nearest market town , they would teaze him , asking how it came about that he was childless . at length he grew so angry that he exclaimed : ' i must and will have a child of some sort or kind , even should it only be a hedgehog ! ' not long after this his wife gave birth to a child , but though the lower half of the little creature was a fine boy , from the waist upwards it was a hedgehog , so that when his mother first saw him she was quite frightened , and said to her husband , ' there now , you have cursed the child yourself . ' the farmer said , ' what 's the use of making a fuss ? i suppose the creature must be christened , but i do n't see how we are to ask anyone to be sponsor to him , and what are we to call him ? ' ' there is nothing we can possibly call him but jack my hedgehog , ' replied the wife .
