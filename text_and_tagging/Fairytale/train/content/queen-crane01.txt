once upon a time there was a poor , poor boy . he went to the king and begged to be taken into service as a shepherd , and all called him " sheep - peter . " while he was herding his sheep , he used to amuse himself with his crossbow . one day he saw a crane sitting in an oak - tree , and wanted to shoot her . the crane , however , hopped down further and further , and at last settled in the lowest branches . then she said : " if you promise not to shoot me , i will help you whenever you are in trouble . you need only to call out : ' god aid me , and queen crane stay by me , and i will succeed ! ' " with that the bird flew away .
