after a while paul decided to go to the castle and herd the king 's hares . his father told him what he had told peter , and more besides . but he insisted on going , and would not listen , and he fared neither better nor worse than peter had . the old woman stood and pulled and jerked at her nose in the tree - trunk , and he laughed , found it very amusing , and let her stand there and torment herself . he was at once taken into service , but the hares all ran away across the hills , though he pursued them , and worked away like a shepherd dog in the sun , and when he came back to the castle in the evening minus his hares , there stood the king with the knife in his hand , cut three broad strips from his back , rubbed in pepper and salt , and flung him into the snake - pit .
