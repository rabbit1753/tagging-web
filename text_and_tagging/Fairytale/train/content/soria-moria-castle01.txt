once upon a time there was a couple who had an only son named halvor . while he was still but a little lad , he would do nothing at all ; but was always sitting at the hearth , digging in the ashes . his parents apprenticed him here and apprenticed him there , to be taught something , but halvor never stayed . when he had been anywhere for a few days , he ran away again , went back home , sat down at the hearth , and dug in the ashes . but once a master mariner came along and asked whether halvor would not like to go with him , and sail the seas , and see foreign lands . indeed , halvor would like to do so very much , and it did not take him long to make up his mind .
