' now , child , ' said she , ' tell me what impression you have received . ' ' you sent me , madam , ' answered sylvia , ' to the court of iris , on whom you had bestowed the gift of beauty . she never tells anyone , however , that it was your gift , though she often speaks of your kindness in general . it seemed to me that her loveliness , which fairly dazzled me at first , had absolutely deprived her of the use of any of her other gifts or graces . in allowing herself to be seen , she appeared to think that she was doing all that could possibly be required of her . but , unfortunately , while i was still with her she became seriously ill . though she presently recovered , her beauty is entirely gone , so that she hates the very sight of herself , and is in despair . she entreated me to tell you what had happened , and to beg you , in pity , to give her beauty back to her . and , indeed , she does need it terribly , for all the things in her that were tolerable , and even agreeable , when she was so pretty , seem quite different now she is ugly . it is so long since she thought of using her mind or her natural cleverness , that i really do n't think she has any left now . she is quite aware of all this herself , so you may imagine how unhappy she is , and how earnestly she begs for your aid .
