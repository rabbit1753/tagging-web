" you have won your desire of the great spirit , " said the beautiful stranger . " you have wrestled manfully . to - morrow will be the seventh day of your fasting . your father will give you food to strengthen you , and as it is the last day of trial you will prevail . i know this , and now tell you what you must do to benefit your family and your people . tomorrow , " he repeated , " i shall meet you and wrestle with you for the last time . as soon as you have prevailed against me , you will strip off my garments and throw me down , clean the earth of roots and weeds , make it soft , and bury me in the spot . when you have done this , leave my body in the earth , and do not disturb it . come at times to visit the place , to see whether i have come to life . above all be careful to never let the grass or weeds grow upon my grave . once a month cover me with fresh earth . if you follow these my instructions you will accomplish your object of doing good to your fellow - creatures by teaching them the knowledge i now teach you . " he then shook wunzh by the hand and disappeared , but he was gone so soon that wunzh could not tell what direction he took .
