' it is ready , mistress , ' whispered a queer little voice which made her jump , and , looking behind her , she saw a lovely palace made of the finest woods , and a row of slaves with tall fans bowing before the door . glad indeed was she to enter , for she was very tired , and , after eating a good supper of fruit and milk which she found in one of the rooms , she flung herself down on a pile of cushions and went to sleep with her baby beside her . here she stayed quietly , and every day the baby grew taller and stronger , and very soon he could run about and even talk . of course the neighbours had a great deal to say about the house which had been built so quickly -- so very quickly -- on the outskirts of the town , and invented all kinds of stories about the rich lady who lived in it . and by and bye , when the king returned with his son from the wars , some of these tales reached his ears . ' it is really very odd about that house under the palms , ' he said to the queen ; ' i must find out something of the lady whom no one ever sees . i daresay it is not a lady at all , but a gang of conspirators who want to get possession of my throne . to - morrow i shall take my son and my chief ministers and insist on getting inside .
