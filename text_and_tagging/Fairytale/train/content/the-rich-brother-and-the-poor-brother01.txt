there was once a rich old man who had two sons , and as his wife was dead , the elder lived with him , and helped him to look after his property . for a long time all went well ; the young man got up very early in the morning , and worked hard all day , and at the end of every week his father counted up the money they had made , and rubbed his hands with delight , as he saw how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was becoming . ' it will soon be full now , and i shall have to buy a larger one , ' he said to himself , and so busy was he with the thought of his money , that he did not notice how bright his son 's face had grown , nor how he sometimes started when he was spoken to , as if his mind was far away . one day , however , the old man went to the city on business , which he had not done for three years at least . it was market day , and he met with many people he knew , and it was getting quite late when he turned into the inn yard , and bade an ostler saddle his horse , and bring it round directly . while he was waiting in the hall , the landlady came up for a gossip , and after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she asked him how he liked his new daughter - in - law , and whether he had been surprised at the marriage .
