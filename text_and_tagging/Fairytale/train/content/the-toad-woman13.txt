she was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint ; but when she found that they were stark dead , and placed in this way to mock her , her fury was very great indeed . she ran after the tracks of the young man and his mother as fast as she could ; so fast , indeed , that she was on the very point of overtaking them , when the dog , spirit - iron , coming close up to his master , whispered to him--"snakeberry ! " " let the snakeberry spring up to detain her ! " cried out the young man ; and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path , for a long distance ; and the old toad - woman , who was almost as fond of these berries as she was of fat bears , could not avoid stooping down to pick and eat . the old toad - woman was very anxious to get forward , but the snakeberry - vines kept spreading out on every side ; and they still grow and grow , and spread and spread ; and to this day the wicked old toad - woman is busy picking the berries , and she will never be able to get beyond to the other side , to disturb the happiness of the young hunter and his mother , who still live , with their faithful dog , in the shadow of the beautiful wood - side where they were born .
