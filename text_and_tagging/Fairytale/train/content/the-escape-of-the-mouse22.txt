' i am about to hang a thief that i caught robbing me ! ' ' what manner of thief is that ? ' inquired the scholar . ' i see a creature in thy hand like upon a mouse , and ill does it become a man of thy rank to touch a reptile like this . let it go free . ' ' i will not let it go free , ' cried manawyddan . ' i caught it robbing me , and it shall suffer the doom of a thief . ' ' lord ! ' said the scholar , ' sooner than see a man like thee at such a work . i would give thee a pound which i have received as alms to let it go free . ' ' i will not let it go free , neither will i sell it . ' ' as thou wilt , lord , ' answered the scholar , and he went his way . ' i will neither sell it nor set it free . ' ' it is true that a mouse is worth nothing . rather than see thee defile thyself with touching such a reptile as this , i will give thee three pounds for it . ' ' i will not take any price for it . it shall be hanged as it deserves . ' ' willingly , my lord , if it is thy pleasure . ' and the priest went his way .
