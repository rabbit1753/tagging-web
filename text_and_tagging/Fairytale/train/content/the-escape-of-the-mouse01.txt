manawyddan the prince and his friend pryderi were wanderers . the brother of manawyddan had been slain . his throne was taken from him . very sorrowful was manawyddan , but pryderi was stout of heart , and bade him be of good cheer . he knew a way out of his trouble . ' and what may that be ? ' asked manawyddan . ' it is that thou marry my mother rhiannon and become lord of the fair lands that i will give her for dowry . never did any lady have more wit than she . in her youth none was more lovely ; even yet she is good to look upon . ' ' thou art the best friend that ever a man had , ' said manawyddan . ' let us go now to seek rhiannon , and the lands where she dwells . '
