' i will lie here and rest under this tree , ' he said to his attendants . ' you can go and shoot instead , and i will just have this slave to stay with me ! ' away they went , and the young man fell asleep , and slept long . suddenly he was awakened by something wet and salt falling on his face . ' what is that ? is it raining ? ' he said to his slave . ' go and look . ' ' no , master , it is not raining , ' answered the slave . ' then climb up the tree and see what it is , ' and the slave climbed up , and came back and told his master that a beautiful girl was sitting up there , and that it must have been her tears which had fallen on the face of the king 's son . ' why was she crying ? ' inquired the prince . ' i can not tell -- i did not dare to ask her ; but perhaps she would tell you . ' and the master , greatly wondering , climbed up the tree .
