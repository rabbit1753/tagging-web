" with all my heart , " says tom . " send a jackeen to show me where he lives , and we 'll see how he behaves to a stranger . " the princess was not well pleased , for tom looked a different person with fine clothes and a nice green birredh over his long , curly hair ; and besides , he 'd got one laugh out of her . however , the king gave his consent . in an hour and a half the horrible wolf was walking in the palace yard , and tom a step or two behind , with his club on his shoulder , just as a shepherd would be walking after a pet lamb . the king and queen and princess were safe up in their gallery , but the officers and people of the court that were padrowling about the great bawn , when they saw the big baste coming in gave themselves up , and began to make for doors and gates . the wolf licked his chops , as if he was saying , " would n't i enjoy a breakfast off a couple of yez !
