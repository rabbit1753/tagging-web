but the lad did nothing but grumble and growl , and seemed as sore over his bargain as though he had been trying to trick a jew . what did he want with a lass for a wife who could neither brew nor bake nor boil blue beans ? that is what he said . all the same , they were hitched to the same plough , and there was nothing for it but to pull together the best they could . so off they packed , and the poor princess trudged after him and carried his bundle . so they went on until they came to a poor , mean little hut . there she had to take off her fine clothes and put on rags and tatters ; and that was the way she came home . " well , " said the gooseherd one day , " it 's not the good end of the bargain that i have had in marrying ; all the same , one must make the best one can of a crooked stick when there is none other to be cut in the hedge . it is little or nothing you are fit for ; but here is a basket of eggs , and you shall take them to the market and sell them .
