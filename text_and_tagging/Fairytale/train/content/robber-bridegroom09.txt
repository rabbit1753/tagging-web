when the wedding - day came , the friends and neighbours assembled , the miller having invited them , and the bridegroom also appeared . when they were all seated at table , each one had to tell a story . but the bride sat still , and said nothing , till at last the bridegroom said to her , " now , sweetheart , do you know no story ? tell us something . " she answered , " i will tell you my dream . i was going alone through a wood , and i came at last to a house in which there was no living soul , but by the wall was a bird in a cage , who cried , ' turn back , turn back , thou pretty bride , within this house thou must not bide , for evil things do here betide . ' "
