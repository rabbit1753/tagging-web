when she came out , the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper -- at least he had it spread out , but he was looking over the top of it . he was so polite , that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night . he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day . he said he loved eggs and ducklings ; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood - shed . jemima puddle - duck came every afternoon ; she laid nine eggs in the nest . they were greeny white and very large . the foxy gentleman admired them immensely . he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there . at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--"and i will bring a bag of corn with me , so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched . they might catch cold , " said the conscientious jemima . " madam , i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag ; i will provide oats . but before you commence your tedious sitting , i intend to give you a treat . let us have a dinner - party all to ourselves ! " " may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm - garden to make a savoury omelette ? sage and thyme , and mint and two onions , and some parsley . i will provide lard for the stuff - lard for the omelette , " said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers .
