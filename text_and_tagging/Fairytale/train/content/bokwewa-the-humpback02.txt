owing to his lack of strength , bokwewa never engaged in the chase , but gave his attention entirely to the affairs of the lodge . in the long winter evenings he passed the time in telling his brother stories of the giants , spirits , weendigoes , and fairies of the elder age , when they had the exclusive charge of the world . he also at times taught his brother the manner in which game should be pursued , pointed out to him the ways of the different beasts and birds of the chase , and assigned the seasons at which they could be hunted with most success .
