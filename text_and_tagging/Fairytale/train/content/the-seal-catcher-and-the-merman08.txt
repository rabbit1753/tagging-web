the seal catcher did as he was bid . when he found himself safe on the ground , he peeped cautiously over the edge of the cliff to see if there were any seals lying on the rocks below . to his astonishment he saw no rocks , only the blue sea , which came right up to the foot of the cliff . " where are the seals that you spoke of ? " he asked anxiously , wishing that he had never set out on such a rash adventure . " you will see presently , " answered the stranger , who was attending to his horse 's bridle . the seal catcher was now thoroughly frightened , for he felt sure that some evil was about to befall him . in such a lonely place he knew that it would be useless to cry out for help . and it seemed as if his fears would prove only too true , for the next moment the stranger 's hand was laid upon his shoulder . he felt himself being hurled bodily over the cliff , and then he fell with a splash into the sea . he thought that his last hour had come , and he wondered how anyone could work such a deed of wrong upon an innocent man .
