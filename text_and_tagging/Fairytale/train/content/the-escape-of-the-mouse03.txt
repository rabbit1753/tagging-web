' whither have they gone , and my host also ? ' cried manawyddan . they searched the hall , and there was no man , and the castle , and there was none . in the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts . for a year these four fed on the meat that manawyddan and pryderi killed out hunting , and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather . for a time they desired nothing more , but when the next year began they grew weary . ' we can not spend our lives thus , ' said manawyddan at last , ' let us go into england and learn some trade by which we may live . ' so they left wales , and went to hereford . there they made saddles , while manawyddan fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings . and so greatly did the townsfolk love these saddles . no others were bought throughout the whole of hereford , till the saddlers banded together and resolved to slay manawyddan and his companions .
