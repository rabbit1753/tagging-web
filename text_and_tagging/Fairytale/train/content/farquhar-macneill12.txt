when he arrived in the neighbourhood everything seemed strange . there were woods where no woods used to be , and walls where no walls used to be . to his amazement , he could not find his way to the farm . worst of all , in the place where he expected to find his father 's house he found nothing but a crop of rank green nettles . in great distress he looked about for someone to tell him what it all meant . at last he found an old man thatching the roof of a cottage . this old man was so thin and grey that at first farquhar took him for a patch of mist . as he went nearer he saw that he was a human being , and , going close up to the wall and shouting with all his might . he felt sure that such an ancient man would be deaf . he asked him if he could tell him where his friends had gone to , and what had happened to his father 's dwelling .
