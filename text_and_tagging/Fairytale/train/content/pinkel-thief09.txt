pinkel was much pleased at the thought of his adventure , and without more ado he borrowed a little boat which lay moored to the shore , and rowed over to the island at once . it was late by the time he arrived , and almost dark , but he knew by the savoury smell that reached him that the witch was cooking her supper . so he climbed softly on to the roof , and , peering , watched till the old woman 's back was turned , when he quickly drew a handful of salt from his pocket and threw it into the pot . scarcely had he done this when the witch called her daughter and bade her lift the pot off the fire and put the stew into a dish , as it had been cooking quite long enough and she was hungry . but no sooner had she tasted it than she put her spoon down , and declared that her daughter must have been meddling with it , for it was impossible to eat anything that was all made of salt .
