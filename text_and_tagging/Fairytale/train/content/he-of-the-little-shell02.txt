the girl soon grew to be a woman , but the boy increased in stature very slowly . it was a long time before he could even creep , and he was well advanced in years before he could stand alone . when he was able to walk , his sister made him a little bow and arrows , and hung around his neck a small shell , saying : " you shall be called dais imid , or he of the little shell . " every day he would go out with his little bow , shooting at the small birds . the first bird he killed was a tom - tit . his sister was highly pleased when he took it to her . she carefully prepared and stuffed it , and put it away for him .
