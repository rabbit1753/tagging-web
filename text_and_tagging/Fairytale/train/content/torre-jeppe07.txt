" at last he said : " i will not let you go until you promise me that you will go this very night to the brook and ask three times : ' anna perstochter , do you forgive torre jeppe ? ' " the girl promised to do as he said , and he at once released her . the brook was a good mile off ; but she went there and asked three times in a loud voice , as she had promised : " anna perstochter , do you forgive torre jeppe ? " and when she had called the third time a woman 's voice replied from out of the water : " if god has forgiven him , then i , too , forgive him ! " when the girl came back to the church torre jeppe asked eagerly : " what did she say ? " " well , if god has forgiven you , then she , too , will forgive you ! " then torre jeppe thanked her and said : " come back again before sunrise , and you shall receive your reward for the service you have done me . " the girl went back at sunrise , and in the place where the phantom had been sitting she found a bushel of silver coin . in addition she received the two dresses promised her by the tailors . but torre jeppe was never seen again .
