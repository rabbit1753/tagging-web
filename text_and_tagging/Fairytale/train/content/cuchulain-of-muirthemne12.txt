it was about a year after that time there was another feast in emain , and conchubar and his chief men were sitting at the feast . and suddenly they saw from the window a great flock of birds , that lit on the ground and began to eat up everything before them , so that not so much as a blade of grass was left . the men of ulster were vexed when they saw the birds destroying all before them , and they yoked nine of their chariots to follow after them . conchubar was in his own chariot , and there were following with him fergus , son of rogh , and laegaire buadach the battle - winner , and celthair , son of uithecar , and many others , and bricriu of the bitter tongue was along with them . they followed after the birds across the whole country southward , across slieve fuad , by ath lethan , by ath garach and magh gossa , between fir rois and fir ardae . the birds before them always . they were the most beautiful that had ever been seen . nine flocks of them there were , linked together two - and - two with a chain of silver , and at the head of every flock there were two birds of different colours , linked together with a chain of gold . and there were three birds that flew by themselves , and they all went before the chariots to the far end of the country , until the fall of night , and then there was no more seen of them .
