a wooden wand is always kept before her holy picture in the cabin . it often happens that the fish - dragons play in the seas . they are two giant fish who spout up water against one another till the sun in the sky is obscured , and the seas are shrouded in profound darkness . and often , in the distance , one may see a bright opening in the darkness . if the ship holds a course straight for this opening it will win through , and is suddenly floating in calm waters again . looking back , one may see the two fishes still spouting water , and the ship will have passed directly beneath their jaws . but a storm is always near when the fish dragons swim ; therefore it is well to burn paper or wool so that the dragons do not draw the ship down into the depths . or the master of the wand may burn incense before the wand in the cabin . then he must take the wand and swing it over the water three times , in a circle . if he does so the dragons will draw in their tails and disappear .
