black sheep did not reply to this , for she thought the old ram very ill - tempered and selfish , and believed he was doing wrong not to grow more wool . finally the time came to shear the sheep again , and the farmer and his man came into the pasture to look at them , and were surprised to see what a fine , big fleece the black sheep had grown . " there will be three bagsful at the least , " said the master , " and i will keep my promise and give one to the little boy in the lane . but , my goodness ! how scraggly and poor the old ram looks . there is scarcely any wool on him at all . i think i must sell him to the butcher !
