now it happened that the cat and dog met each other on their travels . though they had not been the best of friends at home , they were quite glad to meet among strangers . they sat down under a holly tree and both poured forth their woes . presently a fox passed by , and saw the pair sitting together in a disconsolate fashion . he asked them why they sat there , and what they were grumbling about . the cat replied , ' i have caught many a mouse in my day . now that i am old and past work , my master wants to drown me . ' and the dog said , ' many a night have i watched and guarded my master 's house . now that i am old and deaf , he wants to hang me . ' the fox answered , ' that 's the way of the world . but i 'll help you to get back into your master 's favour , only you must first help me in my own troubles . '
