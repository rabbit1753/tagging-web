now , there was once a maiden called jorinde , who was more beautiful than other maidens . she and a youth named joringel , who was just as good - looking as she was , were betrothed to one another . their greatest delight was to be together , and so that they might get a good long talk , they went one evening for a walk in the wood . ' take care , ' said joringel , ' not to come too close to the castle . ' it was a beautiful evening ; the sun shone brightly between the stems of the trees among the dark green leaves of the forest , and the turtle - dove sang clearly on the old maybushes .
