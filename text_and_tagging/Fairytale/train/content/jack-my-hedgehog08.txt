then jack my hedgehog set off for the first kingdom , and there the king had given strict orders that if anyone should be seen riding a cock and carrying a bagpipe he was to be chased away and shot at , and on no account to be allowed to enter the palace . so when jack my hedgehog rode up the guards charged him with their bayonets , but he put spurs to his cock , flew up over the gate right to the king 's windows , let himself down on the sill , and called out that if he was not given what had been promised him , both the king and his daughter should pay for it with their lives . then the king coaxed and entreated his daughter to go with jack and so save both their lives . the princess dressed herself all in white , and her father gave her a coach with six horses and servants in gorgeous liveries and quantities of money . she stepped into the coach , and jack my hedgehog with his cock and pipes took his place beside her . they both took leave , and the king fully expected never to set eyes on them again . but matters turned out very differently from what he had expected , for when they had got a certain distance from the town jack tore all the princess 's smart clothes off her , and pricked her all over with his bristles , saying : ' that 's what you get for treachery . now go back , i 'll have no more to say to you . ' and with that he hunted her home , and she felt she had been disgraced and put to shame till her life 's end .
