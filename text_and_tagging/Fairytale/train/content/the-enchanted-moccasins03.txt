the old woman then gave to the young man the bones which were to secure his success ; and she informed him with great care how he was to proceed . placing them in his bosom , onwee bahmondang , or the wearer of the ball , continued his journey , and kept eagerly on until he arrived at the village of which he was in search ; and as he was gazing around him , he saw both the tree and the lodge which the old woman had mentioned . he at once bent his steps for the tree , and approaching , he endeavored to reach the suspended lodge . but all his efforts were in vain ; for as often as he attempted to reach it , the tree began to tremble , and it soon shot up so that the lodge could hardly be perceived . he bethought him of his guardian , and invoking his aid , and changing himself into a squirrel , he mounted nimbly up again , in the hope that the lodge would not now escape him . away shot the lodge , climb as briskly as he might . panting , and out of breath , he remembered the instructions of the old woman , and drawing from his bosom one of the bones , he thrust it into the trunk of the tree , and rested himself to be ready to start again .
