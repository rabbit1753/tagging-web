" the crane so addressed was of extraordinary size , and had arrived at a great old age , and , as might be expected , he sat , when first descried by the two sons , in a state of profound thought , revolving his long experience of life there in the midst of the most violent eddies . when he heard himself appealed to , the crane stretched forth his neck with great deliberation , and lifting himself slowly by his wings , he flew across to their assistance . " be careful , " said the old crane , " that you do not touch the crown of my head . i am bald from age and long service , and very tender at that spot . should you be so unlucky as to lay a hand upon it , i shall not be able to avoid throwing you both in the rapids .
