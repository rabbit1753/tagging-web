before many days had passed he reached the southern island , and then slowly but surely made his way to the head - quarters of the chiefs kumaso and takeru . he now met with great difficulties , for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough . the mountains were high and steep , the valleys dark and deep , and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his army . it was all but impossible to go on . though the prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years , and , seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further , he said to himself : " to attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder . we can not clear the roads and fight as well . it is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares . in that way i may be able to kill them without much exertion .
