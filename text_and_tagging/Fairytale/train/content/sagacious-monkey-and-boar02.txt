the woman felt very sorry for the poor little animal , and pleaded for her husband to spare the monkey , but her pleading was all in vain , the man was determined to sell him to the butcher . now the monkey was in the next room and overheard every word of the conversation . he soon understood that he was to be killed , and he said to himself : " barbarous , indeed , is my master ! here i have served him faithfully for years , and instead of allowing me to end my days comfortably and in peace , he is going to let me be cut up by the butcher , and my poor body is to be roasted and stewed and eaten ? woe is me ! what am i to do . ah ! a bright thought has struck me ! there is , i know , a wild boar living in the forest near by . i have often heard tell of his wisdom . perhaps if i go to him and tell him the strait i am in he will give me his counsel . i will go and try .
