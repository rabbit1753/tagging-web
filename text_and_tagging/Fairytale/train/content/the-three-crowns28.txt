to make a long story short , the smith got the quarter of a pound of gold , and the quarter of a pound of silver , and the quarter of a pound of copper , and gave them and the pattern crown to the prince . he shut the forge door at nightfall , and the neighbours all gathered in the yard , and they heard him hammering , hammering , hammering , from that to daybreak ; and every now and then he 'd throw out through the window bits of gold , silver , and copper ; and the idlers scrambled for them , and cursed one another , and prayed for the good luck of the workman . well , just as the sun was thinking to rise , he opened the door , and brought out the three crowns he got from his true love , and such shouting and huzzaing as there was ! the smith asked him to go along with him to the palace , but he refused ; so off set the smith , and the whole townland with him ; and was n't the king rejoiced when he saw the crowns ! ' well , ' says he to the smith , ' you 're a married man . what 's to be done ? ' ' faith , your majesty , i did n't make them crowns at all . it was a big fellow that took service with me yesterday . ' ' well , daughter , will you marry the fellow that made these crowns ? ' ' let me see them first , father , ' said she ; but when she examined them she knew them right well , and guessed it was her true love that sent them . ' i will marry the man that these crowns came from , ' says she .
