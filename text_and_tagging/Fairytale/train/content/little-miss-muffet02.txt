the child 's father spent his days at his office and his evenings at his club ; her mother was a leader in society , and therefore fully engaged from morning till night and from night till morn ; so that little miss muffet seldom saw her parents and scarce knew them when she did see them . i have never known by what name she was christened . perhaps she did not know herself , for everyone had called her " miss muffet " since she could remember . the servants spoke of her respectfully as miss muffet . mrs . muffet would say , at times , " by the way , nurse , how is miss muffet getting along ? " and mr . muffet , when he met his little daughter by chance on the walk or in the hallway , would stop and look at her gravely and say , " so this is miss muffet . well , how are you feeling , little one ? " and then , without heeding her answer , he would walk away .
