thus did the brave prince yamato take escape out of the snare laid for him by his enemy . he was full of resource and courage , and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes . leaving yaidzu he marched eastward , and came to the shore at idzu from whence he wished to cross to kadzusa . in these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the princess ototachibana . for his sake she counted the weariness of the long journeys and the dangers of war as nothing , and her love for her warrior husband was so great that she felt well repaid for all her wanderings if she could but hand him his sword when he sallied forth to battle , or minister to his wants when he returned weary to the camp .
