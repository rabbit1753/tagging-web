' who is there ? ' asked she . ' i ! ' replied somebody . ' and who is " i " ? ' ' the king . let me in . ' full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the door . as the king entered , he noticed that there was no furniture in the room at all , not even a chair . he pretended to be in too great a hurry to see anything around him , and only said ' you must not let me disturb you . i have no time to stay , but you seemed to be in trouble . tell me ; are you very unhappy ? ' ' oh , my lord , we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days ! ' answered she . ' nothing remains for us but to die of hunger . ' ' no , no , you sha n't do that , ' cried the king , ' or if you do , it will be your own fault . you shall come with me into my palace . you will feel as if you were in paradise , i promise you . in return , i only ask one thing of you , that you shall obey my orders exactly .
