upon this board sit boys who turn somersaults , stand on their heads , and perform all sorts of tricks . yet , being so close to the water their danger is very great . it is the custom , therefore , when a boy is hired for this purpose , to give his parents money before he is trained . then , if he falls into the water and is drowned , no one has him on their conscience . farther south the custom differs in so much that instead of boys , beautiful girls are chosen for this purpose .
