the first time he came to earth he was the yellow lord , who taught mankind all sorts of arts . in his later years he fathomed the meaning of the world on the ethereal mount , and flew up to the radiant sun . under the rule of the dschou dynasty he was born again as li oerl , and when he was born his hair and beard were white , for which reason he was called laotsze , " old child . " he wrote the book of " meaning and life " and spread his teachings through the world . he is honored as the head of taoism . at the beginning of the reign of the han dynasty , he again appeared as the old man of the river , ( ho schang gung ) . he spread the teachings of tao abroad mightily , so that from that time on taoism flourished greatly . these doctrines are known to this day as the teachings of the yellow ancient . there is also a saying : " first laotsze was , then the heavens were . " and that must mean that laotsze was that very same yellow ancient of primal days .
