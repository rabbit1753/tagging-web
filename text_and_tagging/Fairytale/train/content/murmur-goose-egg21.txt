" now you can go to the devil , and fetch the tribute from him , " said the king . murmur goose - egg went off with his knapsack on his back , and his club over his shoulder . he had soon reached the right spot . when he got there the devil was away at a trial . there was no one home but his grandmother , and she said she had never yet heard anything about a tribute , and that he was to come back some other time . " yes , indeed , come again to - morrow , " said he . " i know that old excuse ! " but since he was there , he would stay there , for he had to take home the tribute , and he had plenty of time to wait . but when he had eaten all his provisions , he grew weary . he again demanded the tribute from the grandmother . so she did not dare to refuse any longer , and brought out as much money as he could possibly carry in his knapsack . then he set out for home with the tribute . now no sooner had he gone than the devil came home , and when he learned that murmur had taken along a big bag of money . he first beat his grandmother , and then hurried after murmur . and he soon caught up to him , for he ran over sticks and stones , and sometimes flew in between ; while murmur had to stick to the highway with his heavy knapsack . but with the devil at his heels , he began to run as fast as he could . he stretched out the club behind him , to keep the devil from coming to close quarters . and thus they ran along , one behind the other . murmur held the shaft and the devil the end of the club , until they reached a deep valley . there murmur jumped from one mountain - top to another , and the devil followed him so hotly that he ran into the club , fell down into the valley and broke his foot - and there he lay .
