once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king 's son who was enchanted by an old witch , so that he was obliged to sit in a large iron stove in a wood . there he lived for many years , and no one could free him . at last a king 's daughter came into the wood ; she had lost her way , and could not find her father 's kingdom again . she had been wandering round and round for nine days , and she came at last to the iron case . a voice came from within and asked her , ' where do you come from , and where do you want to go ? ' she answered , ' i have lost my way to my father 's kingdom , and i shall never get home again . ' then the voice from the iron stove said , ' i will help you to find your home again , and that in a very short time , if you will promise to do what i ask you . i am a greater prince than you are a princess , and i will marry you . ' then she grew frightened , and thought , ' what can a young lassie do with an iron stove ? ' but as she wanted very much to go home to her father , she promised to do what he wished . he said , ' you must come again , and bring a knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron . '
