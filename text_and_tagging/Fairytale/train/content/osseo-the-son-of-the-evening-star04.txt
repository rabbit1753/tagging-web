" " poor old man , " said she ; " he is talking to his father . what a pity it is that he would not fall and break his neck , that our sister might have a young husband . " presently as they came to a great rock where osseo had been used to breathe his morning and his evening prayer , the star emitted a brighter ray , which shone directly in his face .
