when he heard this kilweh felt proud and happy . surely he must be a man now , he thought , or there would be no talk of a wife for him , and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride , and what she would be like when he beheld her . ' what troubles you , my son ? ' asked his father at last , when kilweh had forgotten something he had been bidden to do , and kilweh blushed red as he answered : ' my stepmother says that none but olwen , the daughter of yspaddaden penkawr , shall be my wife . ' ' that will be easily fulfilled , ' replied his father . ' arthur the king is your cousin . go therefore to him and beg him to cut your hair , and to grant you this boon . ' then the youth pricked forth upon a dapple grey horse of four years old , with a bridle of linked gold , and gold upon his saddle . in his hand he bore two spears of silver with heads of steel ; a war - horn of ivory was slung round his shoulder , and by his side hung a golden sword . before him were two brindled white - breasted greyhounds with collars of rubies round their necks , and the one that was on the left side bounded across to the right side , and the one on the right to the left , and like two sea - swallows sported round him . and his horse cast up four sods with his four hoofs , like four swallows in the air about his head , now above , now below . about him was a robe of purple , and an apple of gold was at each corner , and every one of the apples was of the value of a hundred cows . and the blades of grass bent not beneath him , so light were his horse 's feet as he journeyed toward the gate of arthur 's palace .
