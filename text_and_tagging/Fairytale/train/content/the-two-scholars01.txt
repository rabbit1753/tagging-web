once upon a time there were two scholars . one was named liu tschen and the other yuan dschau . both were young and handsome . one spring day they went together into the hills of tian tai to gather curative herbs . there they came to a little valley where peach - trees blossomed luxuriantly on either side . in the middle of the valley was a cave , where two maidens stood under the blossoming trees , one of them clad in red garments , the other in green . and they were beautiful beyond all telling . they beckoned to the scholars with their hands .
