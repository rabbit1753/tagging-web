" no , " said watanabe , " i am sorry , but i can not grant your request . " " but why ? " asked the old woman . " because , " replied watanabe , " ogres are very revengeful creatures , and if i open the box there is no telling but that the ogre may suddenly appear and carry off his arm . i have had a box made on purpose with a very strong lid , and in this box i keep the ogre 's arm secure ; and i never show it to any one , whatever happens . " " your precaution is very reasonable , " said the old woman . " but i am your old nurse , so surely you will not refuse to show me the arm . i have only just heard of your brave act , and not being able to wait till the morning i came at once to ask you to show it to me .
