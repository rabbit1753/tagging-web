the king began to revive at these hopeful words , and took moti off to his stable where he bade him choose for himself any horse he liked . there were plenty of fine horses in the stalls , but to the king 's astonishment moti chose a poor little rat of a pony that was used to carry grass and water for the rest of the stable . ' but why do you choose that beast ? ' said the king . ' well , you see , your majesty , ' replied moti , ' there are so many chances that i may fall off , and if i choose one of your fine big horses i shall have so far to fall that i shall probably break my leg or my arm , if not my neck , but if i fall off this little beast i ca n't hurt myself much . ' a very comical sight was moti when he rode out to the war . the only weapon he carried was his staff , and to help him to keep his balance on horseback he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly touched the ground as he sat astride the little pony . the rest of the king 's cavalry were not very numerous , but they pranced along in armour on fine horses . behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed with all sorts of weapons , and last of all was the king with his attendants , very nervous and ill at ease . so the army started .
