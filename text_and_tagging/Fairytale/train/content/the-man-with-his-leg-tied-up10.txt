at one time a buffalo would gain handsomely upon aggo , and be just at the point of laying hold of him , when off aggo would hop , a good furlong , in an oblique line , wide out of his reach ; which bringing him nearly in contact with another of the herd , away he would go again , just as far off in another direction . and in this way aggo kept the whole company of the buffalos zig - zagging across the plain , with the poor king at their head , running to and fro , shouting among them and hurrying them about in the wildest way . it was an extraordinary road that aggo was taking toward home ; and after a time it so puzzled and bewildered the buffalos that they were driven half out of their wits , and they roared , and brandished their tails , and foamed , as if they would put out of countenance and frighten out of sight the old man in the moon , who was looking on all the time , just above the edge of the prairie . as for the king himself , losing at last all patience at the absurd idea of chasing a man with one leg all night long , he called his herd together , and fled , in disgust , toward the west , and never more appeared in all that part of the country .
