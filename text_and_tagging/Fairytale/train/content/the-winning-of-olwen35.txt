then they sent a messenger to arthur to tell him that mabon was found , and he brought all his warriors to the castle of gloucester and fell fiercely upon it ; while kai and bedwyr went on the shoulders of the salmon to the gate of the dungeon , and broke it down and carried away mabon . and he now being free returned home with arthur . after this , on a certain day , as gwythyr was walking across a mountain he heard a grievous cry , and he hastened towards it . in a little valley he saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the anthill , and all the ants were hurrying to and fro , not knowing whither to go . gwythyr had pity on them , and put out the fire , and in gratitude the ants brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which yspaddaden penkawr required of kilweh . and many of the other marvels were done likewise by arthur and his knights , and at last it came to the fight with trwyth the board , to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor that lay between his ears . but hard was the boar to catch , and fiercely did he fight when arthur 's men gave him battle , so that many of them were slain .
