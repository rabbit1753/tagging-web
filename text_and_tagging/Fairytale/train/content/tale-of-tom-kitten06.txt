tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers . he came up the rockery by degrees , breaking the ferns , and shedding buttons right and left . he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall . moppet and mittens tried to pull him together ; his hat fell off , and the rest of his buttons burst .
