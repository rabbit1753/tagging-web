" are you mad , jamie ? " cried his mother in terror . " sure they 'll kill you this time for what you done on them last year . " jamie made light of her fears and went his way . as he reached the crab - tree grove he saw bright lights in the castle windows as before , and heard loud talking . creeping under the window he heard the wee folk say , " that was a poor trick jamie freel played us this night last year , when he stole the young lady from us . " " ay , " said the tiny woman , " an ' i punished him for it , for there she sits a dumb image by the hearth , but he does not know that three drops out of this glass that i hold in my hand wad gie her her hearing and speech back again . " jamie 's heart beat fast as he entered the hall . again he was greeted by a chorus of welcomes from the company--"here comes jamie freel ! welcome , welcome , jamie ! " as soon as the tumult subsided the little woman said , " you be to drink our health , jamie , out of this glass in my hand . " jamie snatched the glass from her and darted to the door . he never knew how he reached his cabin , but he arrived there breathless and sank on a stove by the fire . " you 're kilt , surely , this time , my poor boy , " said his mother . " no , indeed , better luck than ever this time ! " and he gave the lady three drops of the liquid that still remained at the bottom of the glass , notwithstanding his mad race over the potato field . the lady began to speak , and her first words were words of thanks to jamie . the three inmates of the cabin had so much to say to one another that , long after cock - crow , when the fairy music had quite ceased , they were talking round the fire .
