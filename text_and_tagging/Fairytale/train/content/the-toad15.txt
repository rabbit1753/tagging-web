and the mother - stork began talking in the nest , and told about egypt and the waters of the nile , and the incomparable mud that was to be found in that strange land ; and all this sounded new and very charming to the little toad . " i must go to egypt ! " said she . " if the stork or one of his young ones would only take me ! i would oblige him in return . yes , i shall get to egypt , for i feel so happy ! all the longing and all the pleasure that i feel is much better than having a jewel in one 's head . " and it was just she who had the jewel . that jewel was the continual striving and desire to go upward -- ever upward . it gleamed in her head , gleamed in joy , beamed brightly in her longing .
