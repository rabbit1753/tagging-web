all at once he fell head over heels in the dark , down a hole , and landed on a heap of very dirty rags . when tom kitten picked himself up and looked about him -- he found himself in a place that he had never seen before , although he had lived all his life in the house . it was a very small stuffy fusty room , with boards , and rafters , and cobwebs , and lath and plaster . opposite to him -- as far away as he could sit -- was an enormous rat . " what do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts ? " said the rat , chattering his teeth . " please sir , the chimney wants sweeping , " said poor tom kitten . " anna maria ! anna maria ! " squeaked the rat . there was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter . all in a minute she rushed upon tom kitten , and before he knew what was happening-- his coat was pulled off , and he was rolled up in a bundle , and tied with string in very hard knots .
