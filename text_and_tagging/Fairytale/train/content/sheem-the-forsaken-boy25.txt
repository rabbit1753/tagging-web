in the sand , as he drew closer to the land , he saw the tracks as of that animal fleeing away ; and besides these the prints of human hands . but what were the pity and astonishment that smote owasso to the heart when he espied his poor little brother -- poor little forsaken sheem -- half boy and half wolf , flying along the shore . owasso immediately leaped upon the ground and strove to catch him in his arms , saying soothingly , " my brother ! my brother ! come to me . " but the poor wolf - boy avoided his grasp , crying , as he fled , " neesia , neesia . since you left me going in the canoe , a - he - ee , i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee . i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee ! " and howling between these words of lament . the elder brother , sore at heart , and feeling all of his brotherly affection strongly returning , with renewed anguish , cried out , " my brother ! my brother ! my brother ! " but the nearer he approached to poor sheem , the faster he fled , and the more rapidly the change went on . the boy - wolf by turns singing and howling , and calling out the name , first of his brother and then of his sister , till the change was complete . he leaped upon a bank , and looking back , and casting upon owasso a glance of deep reproach and grief , he exclaimed , " i am a wolf ! " and disappeared in the woods .
