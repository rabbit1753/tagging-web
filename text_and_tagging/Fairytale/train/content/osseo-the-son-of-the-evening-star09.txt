osseo lived happy and contented in the parental lodge , and in due time his wife presented him with a son , who grew up rapidly , and in the very likeness of osseo himself . he was very quick and ready in learning every thing that was done in his grandfather 's dominions , but he wished also to learn the art of hunting , for he had heard that this was a favorite pursuit below . to gratify him , his father made him a bow and arrows , and he then let the birds out of the cage that he might practice in shooting . in this pastime he soon became expert , and the very first day he brought down a bird ; but when he went to pick it up , to his amazement it was a beautiful young woman , with the arrow sticking in her breast . it was one of his younger aunts . the moment her blood fell upon the surface of that pure and spotless planet , the charm was dissolved . the boy immediately found himself sinking , although he was partly upheld by something like wings until he passed through the lower clouds , and he then suddenly dropped upon a high , breezy island in a large lake . he was pleased , on looking up , to see all his aunts and uncles following him in the form of birds , and he soon discovered the silver lodge , with his father and mother , descending , with its waving tassels fluttering like so many insects ' gilded wings .
