' this will do very well , ' thought moti as they whirled in at the entrance . as soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of its own accord and moti immediately rolled off ; but he jumped up at once , tied the beast up , and called for some breakfast . presently the afghans appeared , out of breath and furious , and claimed the horse . ' what do you mean ? ' cried moti , with his mouth full of rice , ' it 's my horse ; i paid you fifty pieces of silver for it -- quite a bargain , i 'm sure ! ' ' nonsense ! it is our horse , ' answered one of the afghans beginning to untie the bridle . ' leave off , ' shouted moti , seizing his staff ; ' if you do n't let my horse alone i 'll crack your skulls ! you thieves ! i know you ! last night you took my money , so to - day i took your horse ; that 's fair enough !
