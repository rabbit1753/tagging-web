" away , away ! " barked the yard - dog . " i 'll tell you ; they said i was a pretty little fellow once . then i used to lie in a velvet - covered chair , up at the master 's house , and sit in the mistress 's lap . they used to kiss my nose , and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief , and i was called ' ami , dear ami , sweet ami . ' but after a while i grew too big for them , and they sent me away to the housekeeper 's room . so i came to live on the lower story . you can look into the room from where you stand , and see where i was master once . i was indeed master to the housekeeper . it was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs . but i was more comfortable , for i was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as i had been . i received quite as good food , or even better . i had my own cushion , and there was a stove -- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year . i used to go under the stove , and lie down quite beneath it . ah , i still dream of that stove . away , away !
