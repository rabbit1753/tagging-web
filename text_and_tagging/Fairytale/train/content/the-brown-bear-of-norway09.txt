now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in the morning , and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet drink out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed . one night she contrived not to drink any of it , though she pretended to do so ; and she was wakeful enough in the morning , and saw her husband passing out through a panel in the wainscot , though she kept her eyelids nearly closed . the next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset that she saved the evening before put into her husband 's night drink , and that made him sleep sound enough . she got up after midnight , passed through the panel , and found a beautiful brown bear 's hide hanging in the corner . then she stole back , and went down to the parlour fire , and put the hide into the middle of it till it was all fine ashes . she then lay down by her husband , gave him a kiss on the cheek , and fell asleep . if she was to live a hundred years she 'd never forget how she wakened next morning , and found her husband looking down on her with misery and anger in his face . ' unhappy woman , ' said he , ' you have separated us for ever ! why had n't you patience for five years ? i am now obliged , whether i like or no , to go a three days ' journey to the witch 's castle , and marry her daughter . the skin that was my guard you have burned it , and the egg - wife that gave you the counsel was the witch herself . i wo n't reproach you : your punishment will be severe without it . farewell for ever !
