as she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream . the old woman looked up from her work and saw this large peach . she was sixty years of age , yet in all her life she had never seen such a big peach as this . " how delicious that peach must be ! " she said to herself . " i must certainly get it and take it home to my old man .
