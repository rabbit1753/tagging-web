hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him . the dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers , and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony . as soon as they sat down , the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out , and behind them followed ten red - carp musicians with the koto and the samisen . thus the hours flew by till midnight , and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede . the dragon king was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp , tramp ! as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away . then hidesato called to the dragon king to come out with him on the balcony , for the centipede was dead and he had nothing more to fear . then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy , and hidesato pointed to the lake . there lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water , which was dyed red with its blood . the gratitude of the dragon king knew no bounds . the whole family came and bowed down before the warrior , calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all japan . another feast was prepared , more sumptuous than the first . all kinds of fish , prepared in every imaginable way , raw , stewed , boiled and roasted , served on coral trays and crystal dishes , were put before him , and the wine was the best that hidesato had ever tasted in his life . to add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly , the lake glittered like a liquid diamond , and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night .
