" very well , " said the leader of the buffalos , whose form was nothing but bone . " yes , we know it , " and he and his followers moved off a little space from maidwa , as if they were afraid of him . " you have come , " resumed the buffalo - spirit , " to a place where a living man has never before been . you will return immediately to your tribe , for , under pretense of recovering one of the magic arrows which belong to you by your father 's dying wish , they have sent you off that they might become possessed of your beautiful wife , the red swan . speed home ! you will find the magic arrow at the lodge - door . you will live to a very old age , and die happily . you can go no further in these abodes of ours . " maidwa looked , as he thought , to the west , and saw a bright light as if the sun was shining in its splendor , but he saw no sun . " what light is that yonder ? " he asked . the all - boned buffalo answered--"it is the place where those who were good dwell . " " and that dark cloud ? " maidwa again asked . " it is the place of the wicked , " answered the buffalo . maidwa turned away , for it was very dark , and it pained his eyes to look upon it ; and , moving away by the aid of his guardian spirits , he again stood upon the earth , and beheld the sun giving light as usual .
