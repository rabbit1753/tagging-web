now notscha had been absent in the spirit upon that day . when he returned he found his temple destroyed ; and the spirit of the hill gave him the details . notscha hurried to his master and related with tears what had befallen him . the latter was roused and said : " it is li dsing 's fault . after you had given back your body to your parents , you were no further concern of his . why should he withdraw from you the enjoyment of the incense ? " then the great one made a body of lotus - plants , gave it the gift of life , and enclosed the soul of notscha within it . this done he called out in a loud voice : " arise ! " a drawing of breath was heard , and notscha leaped up once more in the shape of a small boy . he flung himself down before his master and thanked him . the latter bestowed upon him the magic of the fiery lance , and notscha thenceforward had two whirling wheels beneath his feet : the wheel of the wind and the wheel of fire . with these he could rise up and down in the air . the master also gave him a bag of panther - skin in which to keep his armlet and his silken cloth .
