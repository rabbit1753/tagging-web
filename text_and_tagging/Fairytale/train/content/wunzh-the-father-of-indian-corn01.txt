in time past -- we can not tell exactly how many , many years ago -- a poor indian was living , with his wife and children , in a beautiful part of the country . he was not only poor , but he had the misfortune to be inexpert in procuring food for his family . his children were all too young to give him assistance . although of a lowly condition and straitened in his circumstances , he was a man of kind and contented disposition . he was always thankful to the great spirit for every thing he received . he even stood in the door of his lodge to bless the birds that flew past in the summer evenings . although , if he had been of a complaining temper , he might have repined that they were not rather spread upon the table for his evening meal . the same gracious and sweet disposition was inherited by his eldest son , who had now arrived at the proper age to undertake the ceremony of the fast . this was to learn what kind of a spirit would be his guide and guardian through life . wunzh , for this was his name , had been an obedient boy from his infancy -- pensive , thoughtful , and gentle -- so that he was beloved by the whole family .
