but when the troll noticed he was getting the worst of it , he grew frightened , quickly ran to a high tree , and clambered into it . silverwhite and the dogs ran after him , the dogs barking as loudly as they could . then the troll begged for his life and said : " dear silverwhite , i will take wergild for my brothers , only bid your dogs be still , so that we may talk . " the king bade his dogs be still , but in vain , they only barked the more loudly . then the troll tore three hairs from his head , handed them to silverwhite and said : " lay a hair on each of the dogs , and then they will be as quiet as can be . " the king did so and at once the dogs fell silent , and lay motionless as though they had grown fast to the ground . now silverwhite realized that he had been deceived ; but it was too late . the troll was already descending from the tree , and he drew his sword and again began to fight . but they had exchanged no more than a few blows , before silverwhite received a mortal wound , and lay on the earth in a pool of blood .
