unfortunately , the new - comer was by nature spiteful and envious , and could not bear anyone to have better luck than himself . by dint of spying through keyholes and listening at doors , he learned that the king , old and ugly though he was , had fallen in love with the princess bella - flor , who would have nothing to say to him , and had hidden herself in some mountain castle , no one knew where . ' that will do nicely , ' thought the scoundrel , rubbing his hands . ' it will be quite easy to get the king to send my brother in search of her , and if he returns without finding her , his head will be the forfeit . either way , he will be out of my path . ' so he went at once to the lord high chamberlain and craved an audience of the king , to whom he declared he wished to tell some news of the highest importance . the king admitted him into the presence chamber without delay , and bade him state what he had to say , and to be quick about it .
