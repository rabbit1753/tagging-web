" i was giving a representation , " he said , " in the hall of the posting - house in the little town of slagelse . there was a splendid audience , entirely juvenile excepting two respectable matrons . all at once , a person in black , of student - like appearance , entered the room , and sat down . he laughed aloud at the telling points , and applauded quite at the proper time . this was a very unusual spectator for me , and i felt anxious to know who he was . i heard that he was a member of the polytechnic institution in copenhagen , who had been sent out to lecture to the people in the provinces . punctually at eight o'clock my performance closed , for children must go early to bed , and a manager must also consult the convenience of the public .
