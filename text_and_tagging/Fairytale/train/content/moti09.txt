at last news reached the king that moti had exchanged his horse for a live tiger ; and the monarch himself came down , half disbelieving the tale , to see if it were really true . someone at last awaked moti with the news that his royal master was come ; and he arose yawning , and was soon delightedly explaining and showing off his new possession . the king , however , did not share his pleasure at all , but called up a soldier to shoot the tiger , much to the relief of all the inmates of the serai except moti . if the king , however , was before convinced that moti was one of the wisest of men , he was now still more convinced that he was the bravest , and he increased his pay a hundredfold , so that our hero thought that he was the luckiest of men . a week or two after this incident the king sent for moti , who on arrival found his master in despair . a neighbouring monarch , he explained , who had many more soldiers than he , had declared war against him , and he was at his wits ' end , for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers enough to fight him -- what was he to do ? ' if that is all , do n't you trouble , ' said moti . ' turn out your men , and i 'll go with them , and we 'll soon bring this robber to reason . '
