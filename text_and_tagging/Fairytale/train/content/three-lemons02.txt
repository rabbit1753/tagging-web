mike by the stove replied that he had neither said nor thought anything of the kind ; but that seeing the king was so severe , he would try it . so he took a knapsack full of food and set out . but he had only pushed a little way into the wood before he grew hungry , and thought he would sample the provisions they had given him at the king 's castle . when he had sat down in all peace and comfort under a pine - tree by the side of the road , an old woman came limping along , and asked him what he had in his knapsack . " meat and bacon , granny , " said the youth . " if you are hungry , come and share with me ! " she thanked him , satisfied her hunger , and then telling him she would do him a favor in turn , limped off into the wood . when mike by the stove had eaten his fill , he slung his knapsack across his shoulder once more , and went his way ; but he had only gone a short distance before he found a whistle . that would be fine , thought he , to have a whistle , and be able to whistle himself a tune while he traveled , and before long he really succeeded in making it sound .
