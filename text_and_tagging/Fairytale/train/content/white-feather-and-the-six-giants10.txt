while these things were passing , there were living in an indian village at some distance , two sisters , the daughters of a chief , who were rivals , and they were at that very time fasting to acquire power , for the purpose of enticing the wearer of the white feather to visit their lodge . they each secretly hoped to engage his affections , and each had built a lodge in the border of the village encampment . the giant knowing this , and having become possessed of the magic plume , went immediately to visit them . as he approached , the sisters , who were on the look - out at their lodge - doors , espied and recognized the feather . the eldest sister had prepared her lodge with great show , and all the finery she could command , so as to attract the eye . the youngest touched nothing in her lodge , but left it in its ordinary state . the eldest went out to meet the giant , and invited him in . he accepted her invitation , and made her his wife . the youngest sister invited the enchanted dog into her lodge , prepared him a good supper and a neat bed , and treated him with much attention . the giant , supposing that whoever possessed the white feather possessed also all its virtues , went out upon the prairie to hunt , hallooing aloud to the game to come and be killed ; but the great hubbub he kept up scared them away , and he returned at night with nothing but himself ; for he had shouted so lustily all day long that he had been even obliged to leave the mighty halloo , with which he had set out , behind .
