so knos was apprenticed to a smith for three years . for his pay he asked a suit of clothes and a sword each year : a sword of five hundredweights the first year , one of ten hundredweights the second year , and one of fifteen hundredweights the third year . but after he had been in the smithy only a few days , the smith was glad to give him all three suits and all three swords at once ; for he smashed all his iron and steel to bits .
