prince milan 's heart was so moved with pity for the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes , to see if he could be of any help . as soon as the duck perceived him , it cried in a human voice , ' oh , dear prince milan , for the love of heaven give me back my garment , and i will be so grateful to you . ' the prince lay the little garment on the bank beside her , and stepped back into the bushes . in a few seconds a beautiful girl in a white robe stood before him , so fair and sweet and young that no pen could describe her . she gave the prince her hand and spoke . ' many thanks , prince milan , for your courtesy . i am the daughter of a wicked magician , and my name is hyacinthia . my father has thirty young daughters , and is a mighty ruler in the underworld , with many castles and great riches . he has been expecting you for ages , but you need have no fear if you will only follow my advice . as soon as you come into the presence of my father , throw yourself at once on the ground and approach him on your knees . do n't mind if he stamps furiously with his feet and curses and swears . i 'll attend to the rest , and in the meantime we had better be off . ' with these words the beautiful hyacinthia stamped on the ground with her little foot , and the earth opened and they both sank down into the lower world .
