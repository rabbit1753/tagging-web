" well , this is quite wonderful , " said the flax . " i could not have believed that i should be so favored by fortune . the fern was not wrong when it sang , ' snip , snap , snurre , basse lurre . ' but the song is not ended yet , i am sure . it is only just beginning . how wonderful it is that , after all i have suffered , i am made something of at last ! i am the luckiest person in the world -- so strong and fine . and how white and long i am ! this is far better than being a mere plant and bearing flowers . then i had no attention , nor any water unless it rained . now i am watched and cared for . every morning the maid turns me over , and i have a shower bath from the watering - pot every evening . yes , and the clergyman 's wife noticed me and said i was the best piece of linen in the whole parish . i can not be happier than i am now .
