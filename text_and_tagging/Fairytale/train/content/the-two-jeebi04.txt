the hunter and his wife looked on with astonishment , but remained silent . they supposed that their guests might have been stricken with famine . the next day , however , the same unusual conduct was repeated . the strange females again tore off the fat and devoured it with eagerness . the third day , the hunter thought that he would anticipate their wants by tying up a share of the hunt , and placing it apart for their express use . they accepted it , but still appeared dissatisfied , and went to the wife 's portion and tore off more . the hunter and his wife were surprised at such rude and unaccountable conduct , but they remained silent , for they respected their guests , and had observed that they had been attended with marked good luck during the sojourn of these mysterious visitors in their lodge . in other respects , the deportment of the females was strictly unexceptionable . they were modest , distant , and silent . they never uttered a word during the day . at night they would occupy themselves in procuring wood , which they carried to the lodge , and then , restoring the implements exactly where they had found them , resume their places without speaking . they were never known to stay out until daylight . they never laughed or jested .
