now there was much talk amongst those who remained without when the gate closed upon bedwyr , and goreu , son of custennin , prevailed with the porter , and he and his companions got in also and hid themselves . by this time the whole of the sword was polished , and kai gave it into the hand of gwrnach the giant , who felt it and said : ' your work is good ; i am content . ' then said kai : ' it is your scabbard that has rusted thy sword ; give it to me that i may take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones . ' and he took the scabbard in one hand and the sword in the other , and came and stood behind the giant , as if he would have sheathed the sword in the scabbard . but with it he struck a blow at the head of the giant , and it rolled from his body . after that they despoiled the castle of its gold and jewels , and returned , bearing the sword of the giant , to arthur 's court .
