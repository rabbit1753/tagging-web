leelinau was the favorite daughter of a hunter , who lived on the lake shore near the base of the lofty highlands , called kaug wudjoo . from her earliest youth she was observed to be thoughtful and retiring . she passed much of her time in solitude , and seemed ever to prefer the companionship of her own shadow to the society of the lodge - circle . whenever she could leave her father 's lodge she would fly to remote haunts and recesses in the woods , or sit in lonely reverie upon some high promontory of rock overlooking the lake . in such places she would often , with her face turned upward , linger long in contemplation of the air , as if she were invoking her guardian spirit , and beseeching him to lighten her sadness .
