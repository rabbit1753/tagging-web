murmur was given a few cart - loads of provisions in his big knapsack , and once more set out . long he wandered , though , over field and wood , over hills and deep valleys , till he came to a great mountain where the troll lived who had robbed the king of the sword . but the troll was not out in the open , and the mountain was closed , so murmur could not get it . so he joined a party of stone - breakers , who were working at a mountainside , and worked along with them . they had never had such a helper , for murmur hewed away at the rocks till they burst , and stone bowlders as large as houses came rolling down . but when he was about to rest and eat up the first cart - load of his provisions , it had already been eaten up . " i have a good appetite myself , " said murmur , " but whoever got hold of it has an even better one , for he has eaten up the bones as well ! "
