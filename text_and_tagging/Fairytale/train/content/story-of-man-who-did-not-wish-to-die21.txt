" you , sentaro , are fond of good living and of every comfort . you are not even like an ordinary man , for you are exceptionally idle . you more sensitive to heat and cold than most people . you would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time ! do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit 's life ? " " in answer to your prayer , however , i will help you in another way . i will send you to the country of perpetual life , where death never comes - where the people live forever ! " saying this , jofuku put into sentaro 's hand a little crane made of paper , telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there .
