the black thong leaped from him , and it bound the giant until the two eyes were going out on his head with the squeezing and with the tightening it gave him , and the giant promised to give him anything at all ; " but spare my life , " says he . " i 'm only asking the loan of the old sword that 's under your bed , " said the lad . " have it , and welcome , " says the giant . he went in , and brought out the sword with him . " now , " says the giant , " strike the two ugliest stumps in the wood , and the sword will cut them without getting a bent edge . " " musha , then , by mary , " says the boy , " i do n't see any stump in the wood uglier than yourself , " and he struck him so that he sent his head seven furrows and seven ridges from the body . " ochone for ever ! " says the head . " if i were to get going on the body again , the men of the world -- they would n't get me off the body again . " " i 'll take care of that myself , " says the boy . when he came home that night the coopers were not able to make enough of vessels for them to hold the quantity of milk that the cows had , and the pigs were not able to eat with the quantity of apples that they had eaten before that . he was a while in that way herding the cows and everything that was in the castle , he had it . there was no one at all going near the castle , for there was fear on them .
