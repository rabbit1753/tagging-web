' to despoil thee , ' replied the bishop . ' it is i who cast the charm over thy lands , to avenge gwawl the son of clud my friend . and it was i who threw the spell upon pryderi to avenge gwawl for the trick that had been played on him in the game of badger in the bag . and not only was i wroth , but my people likewise . when it was known that thou wast come to dwell in the land , they besought me much to change them into mice , that they might eat thy corn . the first and the second nights it was the men of my own house that destroyed thy two fields . on the third night my wife and her ladies came to me . they begged me to change them also into the shape of mice , that they might take part in avenging gwawl . therefore i changed them . yet had she not been ill and slow of foot , thou couldst not have overtaken her . still , since she was caught , i will restore thee pryderi and rhiannon . i will take the charm from off thy lands . i have told thee who she is ; so now set her free .
