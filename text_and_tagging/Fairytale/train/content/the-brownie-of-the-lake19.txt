it was the spring , and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their fete , so one day the brownie asked jegu if he might bring his friends to have supper in the great barn , and whether he would allow them to dance there . of course , jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for the brownie , and he ordered barbaik to spread her best table - cloths in the barn , and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes , and , besides , to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning . he expected she would refuse , as he knew she hated the dwarfs , but she said nothing , and prepared the supper as he had bidden her .
