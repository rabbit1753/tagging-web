all that day the man lay in bed , and whenever his wife entered the room and asked him , with a shake of the head , how he felt , he always replied that he was getting worse . at last , in the evening , she burst into tears , and when he inquired what was the matter , she sobbed out : ' oh , my poor , poor husband , are you really dead ? i must go to - morrow and order your coffin . ' now , when the man heard this , a cold shiver ran through his body , and all at once he knew that he was as well as he had ever been in his life . ' oh , no , no ! ' he cried , ' i feel quite recovered ! indeed , i think i shall go out to work . ' ' you will do no such thing , ' replied his wife . ' just keep quite quiet , for before the sun rises you will be a dead man . '
