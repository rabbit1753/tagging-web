so the cock ran to the bride and said , " bride , give me some red silk ; the brook wants me to give him some red silk ; i want him to give me some water , for the hen lies yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat . " but the bride answered , " first go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow . " and the cock ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it to the bride , and the bride gave him red silk , and he brought it to the brook , and the brook gave him water . so then the cock brought the water to the hen , but alas , it was too late ; the hen had choked in the meanwhile , and lay there dead . and the cock was so grieved that he cried aloud , and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen ; and six mice built a little waggon , on which to carry the poor hen to her grave , and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it , and the cock drove . on the way they met the fox .
