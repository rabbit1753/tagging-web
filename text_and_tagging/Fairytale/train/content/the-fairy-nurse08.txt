it is hard to have anything to do with the good people without getting a mark from them . my brave nurse did n't escape no more than another . she was one thursday at the market of enniscorthy , when what did she see walking among the tubs of butter but the dark man , very hungry - looking , and taking a scoop out of one tub and out of another . ' oh , sir , ' says she , very foolish , ' i hope your lady is well , and the baby . ' ' pretty well , thank you , ' says he , rather frightened like . ' how do i look in this new suit ? ' says he , getting to one side of her . ' i ca n't see you plain at all , sir , ' says she . ' well , now ? ' says he , getting round her back to the other side . ' musha , indeed , sir , your coat looks no better than a withered dock - leaf . ' ' maybe , then , ' says he , ' it will be different now , ' and he struck the eye next him with a switch . friends , she never saw a glimmer after with that one till the day of her death .
