very well ; that suited the prince . the next morning at the rising of the sun he started off to find the fir - tree , and there was no trouble in the finding i can tell you , for it was more than a hundred feet high , and as smooth as glass from root to tip . as for climbing it , he might as well have tried to climb a moonbeam , for in spite of all his trying he did nothing but slip and slip . by and by came the swan maiden as she had come before . " do you climb the fir - tree ? " said she . " none too well , " said the king 's son . " then i may help you in a hard task , " said she . she let down the braids of her golden hair , so that it hung down all about her and upon the ground , and then she began singing to the wind . she sang and sang , and by and by the wind began to blow , and , catching up the maiden 's hair , carried it to the top of the fir - tree , and there tied it to the branches .
