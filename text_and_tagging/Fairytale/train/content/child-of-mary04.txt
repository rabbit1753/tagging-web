after this the foster - mother wished to take another journey , and she told the girl , who was now more than half - grown , that she must take her request not to go , or even so much as peep into the third room , seriously to heart . but when the foster - mother had been away for some time , and the girl was all alone and bored , she could at last resist no longer . " o , " thought she , " how pleasant it would be to take a peep into that third room ! " it is true , that at first she thought she would not do it , because of her foster - mother ; yet when the thought returned to her , she could not hold back , after all ; but decided that she should and must by all means take a peep . so she opened the door the least little bit and swish ! out flew the sun . when the foster - mother then returned , and saw that the sun had flown out , she grieved greatly , and told the girl that now she could positively stay with her no longer . the foster - daughter cried and pleaded even more touchingly than before ; but all to no avail . " no , i must now punish you , " said the foster - mother . " but you shall have your choice of either becoming the most beautiful of all maidens , without the power of speech , or the most homely , yet able to talk . but you must leave this place . " the girl said : " then i would rather be the most beautiful of maidens without the power of speech"and such she became , but from that time on she was dumb .
