" nay , " said jack , " if this be the case i 'd better dispatch you ! " so , jumping upon the block , he stabbed him in the back , when he dropped down dead . jack then proceeded on his journey , and traveled over hills and dales , till arriving at the foot of a high mountain he knocked at the door of a lonely house , when an old man let him in . when jack was seated the hermit thus addressed him : " my son , on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle , kept by the giant galligantus and a vile magician . i lament the fate of a duke 's daughter , whom they seized as she was walking in her father 's garden , and brought hither transformed into a deer .
