then arthur 's men set forth , and kilweh with them , and journeyed till they reached the largest castle in the world , and a black man came out to meet them . ' where did you come from , o man ? ' asked they , ' and whose is that castle ? ' ' that is the castle of gwrnach the giant , as all the world knows , ' answered the man , ' but no guest ever returned thence alive , and none may enter the gate except a craftsman , who brings his trade . ' but little did arthur 's men heed his warning , and they went straight to the gate .
