the lamp had very great anxiety about the next day , for it knew that it had to appear for the first time at the town hall to be inspected by the mayor and the council , who were to decide whether it was fit for further service ; whether it was good enough to be used to light the inhabitants of one of the suburbs , or in the country , at some factory . if the lamp could not be used for one of these purposes , it would be sent at once to an iron foundry to be melted down . in this latter case it might be turned into anything , and it wondered very much whether it would then be able to remember that it had once been a street lamp . this troubled it exceedingly .
