as soon as the first buds of spring appeared , and the delicious fragrance of the young year began to sweeten the air , his father , with the help of his younger brothers , built for wunzh the customary little lodge . it was at a retired spot at some distance from their own , where he would not be disturbed during the solemn rite . to prepare himself , wunzh sought to clear his heart of every evil thought , and to think of nothing that was not good , and beautiful , and kindly . that he might store his mind with pleasant ideas for his dreams , for the first few days he amused himself by walking in the woods and over the mountains , examining the early plants and flowers . as he rambled far and wide , through the wild country , he felt a strong desire to know how the plants and herbs and berries grew , without any aid from man . he wondered why it was that some kinds were good to eat , and that others were possessed of medicinal or poisonous power . after he had become too weak to walk about , and confined himself strictly to the lodge , he recalled these thoughts , and turning them in his mind , he wished he could dream of something that would prove a benefit to his father and family , and to all others of his fellow - creatures .
