" i should like to have that fellow , " said the peasant to himself . " there is plenty of grass for him by our palings , and in the winter we could keep him in the room with us . perhaps it would be more profitable to have a sheep than a cow . shall i exchange ? " the man with the sheep was quite ready , and the bargain was quickly made . and then our peasant continued his way on the highroad with his sheep . soon after this , he overtook another man , who had come into the road from a field , and was carrying a large goose under his arm .
