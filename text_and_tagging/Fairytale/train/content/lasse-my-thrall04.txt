no sooner had he spoken these words than something answered , close to his ear : " what does my master command ? " he looked around , but saw no one . that 's strange , thought he , and once more read aloud : " lasse , my thrall ! " and just as before came the answer : " what does my master command ? " " if there be some one about who hears what i say , he might be kind enough to get me a little something to eat , " said he ; and at that very moment a table , covered with all the good things to eat that one could imagine , was standing in the hut . he at once began to eat and drink and did well by himself . i have never had a better meal in my life , thought he . and when his hunger was completely satisfied , he grew sleepy and took up his scrap of paper again . " lasse , my thrall ! " " what does my master command ? " " now that you have brought me food and drink , you must also bring me a bed in which to sleep . but it must be a very fine bed , " said he ; for as you may well imagine , his ideas were more top - lofty now that he had eaten well . his command was at once obeyed ; and a bed so fine and handsome stood in the hut , that a king might have been glad to have found such sleeping accommodations . now this was all very well and good ; but the good can always be bettered , and when he had lain down , he decided that , after all , the hut was far too wretched for such a fine bed . he took up the scrap of paper : " lasse , my thrall ! " " what does my master command ? " " if you can produce such a meal , and such a bed here in the wild wood , you must surely be able to give me a better room ; for you know i am one of those who are used to sleeping in a castle , with golden mirrors and rugs of gold brocade and luxuries and conveniences of every kind , " said he . and no sooner had he spoken the words , than he was lying in the most magnificent room he had ever seen .
