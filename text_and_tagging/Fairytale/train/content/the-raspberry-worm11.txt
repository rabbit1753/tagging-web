the worst of it was that the shadows of the tress were becoming so long in the evening sunlight , the birds were beginning to fly home , and the day was closing in . at last the sun went down behind the pine tops , and it was cool and dusky in the great wood . the girls became anxious but went steadily on , expecting that the wood would soon end , and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of their home . after they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark . at last they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes , and when they looked around them , they saw , as much as they could in the darkness , that they were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they had picked their baskets and their aprons full . then they were so tired that they sat down on a stone and began to cry .
