towards christmas - time quite little trees were cut down , some not as big as the young fir - tree , or just the same age , and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away . these little trees , which were chosen for their beauty , kept all their branches ; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses . ' whither are those going ? ' asked the fir - tree ; ' they are no bigger than i , and one there was much smaller even ! why do they keep their branches ? where are they taken to ? ' ' we know ! we know ! ' twittered the sparrows . ' down there in the city we have peeped in at the windows , we know where they go ! they attain to the greatest splendour and magnificence you can imagine ! we have looked in at the windows and seen them planted in the middle of the warm room and adorned with the most beautiful things - golden apples , sweet - meats , toys and hundreds of candles . ' ' and then ? ' asked the fir - tree , trembling in every limb with eagerness , ' and then ? what happens then ? ' ' oh , we have n't seen anything more than that . that was simply matchless ! '
