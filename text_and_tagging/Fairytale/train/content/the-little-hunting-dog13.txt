he tried to feed it a few bread - crumbs , but the little dog only sniffed at them and let them lie . then it leaped into the bed and hunted up some nits and gnats in the folds of the linen , which it devoured . then it returned and lay down . when the night had passed the scholar feared it might have run away ; but there it lay , curled up as before . whenever the scholar went to bed , the dog climbed into it and bit to death any vermin it could find . not a fly or gnat dared alight while it was around . the scholar loved it like a jewel of price .
