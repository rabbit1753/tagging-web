once upon a time there was a peasant who had a wheat - field , which was trampled down every saturday night . now the peasant had three sons , and he told each one of them to spend a saturday night in the field , and to watch and see who trampled it down . the oldest was to make the first trial . so he lay down by the upper ridge of the field , and after he had lain there a while he fell asleep . the following morning the whole field had been trampled down , and the young fellow was unable to tell how it had happened .
