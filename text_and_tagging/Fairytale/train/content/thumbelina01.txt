there was once a woman who wanted to have quite a tiny , little child , but she did not know where to get one from . so one day she went to an old witch and said to her : ' i should so much like to have a tiny , little child ; can you tell me where i can get one ? ' ' oh , we have just got one ready!'said the witch . ' here is a barley - corn for you , but it 's not the kind the farmer sows in his field , or feeds the cocks and hens with , i can tell you . put it in a flower - pot , and then you will see something happen . ' ' oh , thank you!'said the woman , and gave the witch a shilling , for that was what it cost . then she went home and planted the barley - corn ; immediately there grew out of it a large and beautiful flower , which looked like a tulip , but the petals were tightly closed as if it were still only a bud .
