there were many other playthings on the table on which they were being set out , but the nicest of all was a pretty little castle made of cardboard , with windows through which you could see into the rooms . in front of the castle stood some little trees surrounding a tiny mirror which looked like a lake . wax swans were floating about and reflecting themselves in it . that was all very pretty ; but the most beautiful thing was a little lady , who stood in the open doorway . she was cut out of paper , but she had on a dress of the finest muslin , with a scarf of narrow blue ribbon round her shoulders , fastened in the middle with a glittering rose made of gold paper , which was as large as her head . the little lady was stretching out both her arms , for she was a dancer , and was lifting up one leg so high in the air that the tin - soldier could n't find it anywhere , and thought that she , too , had only one leg .
