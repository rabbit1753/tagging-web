when it came to jan . 1st there was still no money , and pickles was unable to buy a dog licence . " it is very unpleasant , i am afraid of the police , " said pickles . " it is your own fault for being a terrier ; _ i _ do not require a licence , and neither does kep , the collie dog . " " it is very uncomfortable , i am afraid i shall be summoned . i have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the post office ; " said pickles . " the place is full of policemen . i met one as i was coming home . " " let us send in the bill again to samuel whiskers , ginger , he owes 22/9 for bacon . "
