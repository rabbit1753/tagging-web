the customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities , especially the toffee customers . but there was always no money ; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints . but the sales were enormous , ten times as large as tabitha twitchit 's . as there was always no money , ginger and pickles were obliged to eat their own goods . pickles ate biscuits and ginger ate a dried haddock . they ate them by candle - light after the shop was closed .
