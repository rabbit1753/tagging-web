he went down to the green knight , and took the food from before him and put it before himself . then he took the lady , set her on his own knee , and he and she went on eating . after dinner he put his finger under her girdle , took her to the best chamber in the castle , and stood on guard upon it till morning . before dawn the lady said to lawn dyarrig : " if the green knight strikes the pole of combat first , he 'll win the day ; if you strike first , you 'll win if you do what i tell you . the green knight has so much enchantment that if he sees it is going against him the battle is , he 'll rise like a fog in the air , come down in the same form , strike you , and make a green stone of you . when yourself and himself are going out to fight in the morning , cut a sod a perch long , in the name of the father , son , and holy ghost ; you 'll leave the sod on the next little hillock you meet . when the green knight is coming down and is ready to strike , give him a blow with the sod . you 'll make a green stone of him .
