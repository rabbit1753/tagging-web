" oh , i would n't mind , " said the lamb again ; " i shall grow more wool by winter - time , and i 'm sure i do n't look any worse than you do . " some of the sheep looked at the ram and began to giggle , for he was old and thin , and looked very comical indeed without any wool . and this made him so angry that he went off by himself and began eating grass , and would not speak to the others at all . " i do n't know why sheep should feel badly about having their fleeces cut , " remarked the black sheep , thoughtfully , " for the farmer is very kind to us , and so is his dame , and i am glad my wool serves to keep them warm in the winter . for before the snow comes our wool will grow out again , and we shall not be any the worse for our loss .
