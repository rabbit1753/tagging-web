she thus followed in the pursuit , from valley to valley , and stream to stream , for many months and years ; when she came at length to the lodge of the last of the friendly old grandmothers , as they were called , who gave her the last instructions how to proceed . she told her that she was near the place where her son was to be found ; and she directed her to build a lodge of cedar - boughs , hard by the old toad - woman 's lodge , and to make a little bark dish , and to fill it with the juice of the wild grape . " then , " she said , " your first child ( meaning the dog ) will come and find you out . " these directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to her , and in a short time she heard her son , now grown up , going out to hunt , with his dog , calling out to him , " peewaubik -- spirit - iron -- twee ! twee ! " the dog soon came into the lodge , and she set before him the dish of grape - juice . " see , my child , " she said , addressing him , " the pretty drink your mother gives you . " spirit - iron took a long draught , and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open ; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are . he rose up when he got into the open air , stood upon his hind legs , and looked about . " i see how it is , " he said ; and marching off , erect like a man , he sought out his young master . approaching him in great confidence , he bent down and whispered in his ear ( having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was listening ) , " this old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours . i have found your real mother , and she is worth looking at . when we come back from our day 's sport , i 'll prove it to you .
