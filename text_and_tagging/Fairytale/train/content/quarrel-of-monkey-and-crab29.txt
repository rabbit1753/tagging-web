now the stone mortar had hidden himself with several other stones on the top of the crab 's gate , and as the monkey ran underneath , the mortar and all fell down on the top of the monkey 's head . was it possible for the monkey to bear the weight of the mortar falling on him from the top of the gate ? he lay crushed and in great pain , quite unable to get up . as he lay there helpless the young crab came up , and , holding his great claw scissors over the monkey , he said : " do you now remember that you murdered my father ? " " then you - are - my - enemy ? " gasped the monkey brokenly . " of course , " said the young crab . " it - was - your - father's - fault - not - mine ! " gasped the unrepentant monkey . " can you still lie ? i will soon put an end to your breath ! " and with that he cut off the monkey 's head with his pitcher claws . thus the wicked monkey met his well - merited punishment , and the young crab avenged his father 's death . this is the end of the story of the monkey , the crab , and the persimmon - seed .
