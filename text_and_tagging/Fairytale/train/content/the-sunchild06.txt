then the hares set out , taking letiko with them , and because it was a long way to her home they became hungry by the way . then they said to the little girl : ' climb this tree , dear letiko , and remain there till we have finished eating . ' so letiko climbed the tree , and the hares went grazing . it was not very long , however , before a lamia came under the tree and called out : ' letiko , letiko , come down and see what beautiful shoes i have on . ' ' oh ! my shoes are much finer than yours . ' ' come down . i am in a hurry , for my house is not yet swept . ' ' go home and sweep it then , and come back when you are ready . '
