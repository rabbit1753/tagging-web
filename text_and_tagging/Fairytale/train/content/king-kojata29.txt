when they approached the capital , all the people came out to meet them with great joy and acclamation , and when the king reached his palace the queen met him on the threshold ; beside her stood the prime minister , holding a little cradle in his hands , in which lay a new - born child as beautiful as the day . then the whole thing dawned on the king , and groaning deeply he muttered to himself ' so this is what i did not know about , ' and the tears rolled down his cheeks . all the courtiers standing round were much amazed at the king 's grief , but no one dared to ask him the cause of it . he took the child in his arms and kissed it tenderly ; then laying it in its cradle , he determined to control his emotion and began to reign again as before . the secret of the king remained a secret , though his grave , careworn expression escaped no one 's notice . in the constant dread that his child would be taken from him , poor kojata knew no rest night or day . however , time went on and nothing happened . days and months and years passed , and the prince grew up into a beautiful youth , and at last the king himself forgot all about the incident that had happened so long ago .
