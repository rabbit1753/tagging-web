as they looked round them with delight , a voice said suddenly : ' fish , and see what you will catch . ' now the king had always loved fishing , and never went anywhere without a fish - hook or two in his pocket , so he drew one out hastily , and the queen lent him her girdle to fasten it to , and it had hardly touched the water before it caught a big fish , which made them an excellent meal -- and not before they needed it , for they had found nothing until then but a few wild berries and roots . they thought that for the present they could not do better than stay in this delightful place , and the king set to work , and soon built a bower of branches to shelter them ; and when it was finished the queen was so charmed with it that she declared nothing was lacking to complete her happiness but a flock of sheep , which she and the little prince might tend while the king fished . they soon found that the fish were not only abundant and easily caught , but also very beautiful , with glittering scales of every imaginable hue ; and before long the king discovered that he could teach them to talk and whistle better than any parrot . then he determined to carry some to the nearest town and try to sell them ; and as no one had ever before seen any like them the people flocked about him eagerly and bought all he had caught , so that presently not a house in the city was considered complete without a crystal bowl full of fish , and the king 's customers were very particular about having them to match the rest of the furniture , and gave him a vast amount of trouble in choosing them . however , the money he obtained in this way enabled him to buy the queen her flock of sheep , as well as many of the other things which go to make life pleasant , so that they never once regretted their lost kingdom .
