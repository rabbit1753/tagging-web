" jamie , " said the lady , " be pleased to get me paper and pen and ink that i may write to my father and tell him what has become of me . " she wrote , but weeks passed and she received no answer . again and again she wrote , and still no answer . at length she said , " you must come with me to dublin , jamie , to find my father . " " i have no money to hire a car for you , " he answered . " and how can you travel to dublin on your foot ? " but she implored him so much that he consented to set out with her and walk all the way from fannet to dublin . it was not as easy as the fairy journey . but at last they rang the bell at the door of the house in stephen 's green . " tell my father that his daughter is here , " said she to the servant who opened the door . " the gentleman that lives here has no daughter , my girl . he had one , but she died better nor a year ago . " " do you not know me , sullivan ? " " no , poor girl , i do not . " " let me see the gentleman . i only ask to see him . " " well , that 's not much to ax . we 'll see what can be done . " in a few moments the lady 's father came to the door . " how dare you call me your father ? " cried the old gentleman angrily . " you are an impostor . i have no daughter . "
