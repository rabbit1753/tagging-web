at this the old witch shook her head . " no , " said she , " there is more to be done yet before you can have what you ask for . if you can thatch the roof of the stable with bird feathers , no two of which shall be of the same color , and can do it between the rise and the set of sun to - morrow , then you shall have your sweetheart and welcome . but if you fail your bones shall be ground as fine as malt in the mill . " very well ; that suited the king 's son well enough . so at sunrise he arose and went into the fields with his gun ; but if there were birds to be shot , it was few of them that he saw ; for at noontide he had but two , and they were both of a color . at that time who should come to him but the swan maiden . " one should not tramp and tramp all day with never a bit of rest , " said she ; " come hither and lay your head in my lap for a while . "
