one day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to a pond . here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought . it was autumn . the trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves , which floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond . by and by , kotei 's attention was attracted to a spider on the brink of the water . the little insect was trying to get on to one of the floating leaves near by . it did so at last , and was soon floating over the water to the other side of the pond .
