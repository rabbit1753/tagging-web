once there was a gentleman who married , for his second wife , the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen . she had , by a former husband , two daughters of her own humor , who were , indeed , exactly like her in all things . he had likewise , by another wife , a young daughter , but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper , which she took from her mother , who was the best creature in the world .
