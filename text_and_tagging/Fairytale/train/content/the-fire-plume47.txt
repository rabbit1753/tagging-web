they then took an affectionate leave of each other , wassamo enjoining it upon his cousin , at risk of his life , to not look back when he had once started to return . the cousin , sore at heart , but constrained to obey , parted from them , and as he walked sadly away , he heard a gliding noise as of the sound of waters that were cleaved . he returned home , and told his friends that wassamo and his wife had disappeared , but that he knew not how . no one doubted his word in any thing now . wassamo with his wife soon reached their home at the hills . the old sand - spirit was in excellent health , and delighted to see them . he hailed their return with open arms ; and he opened his arms so very wide , that when he closed them he not only embraced wassamo and his wife , but all of the tobacco - sacks which they had brought with them . the requests of the indian people were made known to him ; he replied that he would attend to all , but that he must first invite his friends to smoke with him . accordingly he at once dispatched his pipe - bearer and confidential aid to summon various spirits of his acquaintance , and set the time for them to come .
