then he grew angry , stood up , took his club , pounded the ground with it , and asked whether they wanted to take the food from his mouth with the blueberries they were blowing out at him from their clumsy blow - pipes . then he struck a few more blows , so that the hills and valleys round about trembled , and all the enemy flew up into the air like chaff , and that was the end of the war . when murmur came back and asked for more work , the king was at a loss , for he had felt sure that now he was rid of him . so he knew of nothing better to do than to send him to the devil 's place .
