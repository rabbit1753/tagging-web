" it is i that should kneel to you , sweetheart , " he said , turning to the blushing girl . " for you have delivered me from a fearful spell , which was cast over me in my infancy by a wicked fairy , who at the same time slew my father . for long years i have lived in that well , the well of the world 's end , waiting for a maiden to appear , who should take pity on me , even in my loathsome disguise . she who would promise to be my wife , and who would also have the kindness to let me into her house , and the courage , at my bidding , to cut off my head . " " now i can return and claim my father 's kingdom , and you , most gracious maiden , will go with me , and be my bride , for you well deserve the honour . " and this was how the girl who went to fetch water from the well of the world 's end became a princess .
