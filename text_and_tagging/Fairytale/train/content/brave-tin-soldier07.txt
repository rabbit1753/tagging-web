" suddenly there appeared a great water - rat , who lived in the drain . " have you a passport ? " asked the rat , " give it to me at once . " but the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever . the boat sailed on and the rat followed it . how he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw , " stop him , stop him ; he has not paid toll , and has not shown his pass . " but the stream rushed on stronger and stronger . the tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended . then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man .
