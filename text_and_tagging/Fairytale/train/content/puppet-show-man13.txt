" plays that are neglected now - a - days by the great public were ran after thirty years ago , and listened to till the tears ran down the cheeks of the audience . these are the pieces i bring forward . i place them before the little ones , who cry over them as papa and mamma used to cry thirty years ago . but i make them shorter , for the youngsters do n't like long speeches . and if they have anything mournful , they like it to be over quickly .
