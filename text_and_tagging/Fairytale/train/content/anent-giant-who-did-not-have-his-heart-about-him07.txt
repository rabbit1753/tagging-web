" well , since i do happen to be here , i will at least make the attempt , " said the prince . " and i want to try to deliver my brothers , who stand outside , turned to stone , and i would like to save you as well . " " well , if you insist upon it , we must see what we can do , " replied the princess . " now you must crawl under the bed here , and must listen carefully when i talk to the giant . but you must not make a sound . " the prince slipped under the bed , and no sooner was he there than the giant came home . " hu , it smells like the flesh of a christian here ! " he cried . " yes , " said the princess , " a jackdaw flew by with a human bone , and let it fall down the chimney . i threw it out again at once , but the odor does not disappear so quickly . " then the giant said no more about it . toward evening he went to bed , but after he had lain there a while , the princess , who sat looking out of the window , said : " there is something i would have asked you about long ago , if only i had dared . " " and what may that be ? " inquired the giant . " i would like to know where you keep your heart , since you do not have it about you ? " said the princess . " o , that is something you need not ask about ; at any rate , it lies under the threshold of the door , " was the giant 's reply . " aha , " thought the prince under the bed , " that is where we will find it ! "
