at length the next day he was seen coming across the valley , and oonagh knew that it was time to commence operations . she immediately made the cradle , and desired finn to lie down in it and cover himself up with the clothes . " you must pass for your own child , " said she , " so just lie there snug and say nothing , but be guided by me . " this , to be sure , was wormwood to finn -- i mean going into the cradle in such a cowardly manner -- but he knew oonagh very well ; and finding that he had nothing else for it , with a very rueful face he gathered himself into it and lay snug , as she had desired him . about two o'clock , as he had been expected , far rua came in . " god save all here ! " said he . " is this where the great finn m'coul lives ? " " indeed it is , honest man , " replied oonagh . " god save you kindly -- won't you be sitting ? " " thank you , ma'am , " says he , sitting down . " you 're mrs . m'coul , i suppose ? " " i am , " says she , " and i have no reason , i hope , to be ashamed of my husband . " " no , " said the other ; " he has the name of being the strongest and bravest man in ireland . but , for all that , there 's a man not far from you that 's very anxious of taking a shake with him . is he at home ? " " why , no , then , " she replied ; " and if ever a man left in a fury he did . it appears that someone told him of a big bosthoon of a giant called far rua being down at the causeway to look for him , and so he set out there to try if he could catch him . troth , i hope , for the poor giant 's sake , he wo n't meet with him , for if he does finn will make paste of him at once . " " well , " said the other , " i am far rua , and i have been seeking him these twelve minths , but he always kept clear of me ; and i will never rest day or night till i lay my hands on him . "
