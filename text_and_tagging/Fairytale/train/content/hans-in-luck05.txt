and hans , as he sat upon his horse , was glad at heart , and rode off with merry cheer . after a while he thought he should like to go quicker , so he began to click with his tongue and to cry " gee - up ! " and the horse began to trot , and hans was thrown before he knew what was going to happen . there he lay in the ditch by the side of the road . the horse would have got away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that way and driving a cow before him . and hans pulled himself together and got upon his feet , feeling very vexed . " poor work , riding , " said he . " especially on a jade like this , who starts off and throws you before you know where you are , going near to break your neck . never shall i try that game again . now , your cow is something worth having . one can jog on comfortably after her and have her milk , butter , and cheese every day , into the bargain . what would i not give to have such a cow ! " " well now , " said the peasant , " since it will be doing you such a favour , i do n't mind exchanging my cow for your horse . " hans agreed most joyfully , and the peasant , swinging himself into the saddle , was soon out of sight . and hans went along driving his cow quietly before him , and thinking all the while of the fine bargain he had made . " with only a piece of bread i shall have everything i can possibly want , for i shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it . if i am thirsty i have nothing to do but to milk my cow . what more is there for heart to wish !
