when they had traveled for some time they reached a cross - road . then silverwhite said : " it seems to me that it would be the best for us to try our luck singly , so let us part . " lillwacker answered : " your advice is good , but how am i to know whether or not you are doing well out in the world ? " " i will give you a token by which you may tell , " said silverwhite , " so long as the water runs clear in this spring you will know that i am alive . if it turns red and roiled , it will mean that i am dead . " silverwhite then drew runes in the water of the spring , said farewell to his brother , and each of them went on alone . lillwacker soon came to a king 's court , and took service there , but every morning he would go to the spring to see how his brother fared .
