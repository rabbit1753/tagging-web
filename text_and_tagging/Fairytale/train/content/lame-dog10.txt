and when evening came and it grew late , everything happened as before . the dog came home from the forest and was very tired . but no sooner had he fallen asleep than the princess rose carefully , lit her lamp and came over to look at him . and when she cast the light on his bed it seemed to her as though the youth had grown even handsomer than the day before , and the longer she looked the more handsome he became ; until she had to laugh and weep from sheer love and longing . she could not take her eyes from him , and sat all night long bent over his pillow , forgetful of her promise and all else , only to be able to look at him . with the first ray of dawn the youth began to stir and awake . then the princess was again frightened , quickly blew out her lamp and lay down in her bed . the youth thought she was sleeping , and not wishing to waken her , rose softly , assumed his other shape , went away and was gone for the entire day .
