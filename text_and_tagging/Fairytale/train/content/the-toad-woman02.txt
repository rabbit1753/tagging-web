after a short time , the woman heard the cry of the dog , and running home as fast as she could , she found her child gone , and the dog too . on looking around , she saw scattered upon the ground pieces of the wampum of her child 's cradle , and she knew that the dog had been faithful , and had striven his best to save her child from being carried off , as he had been , by an old woman , from a distant country , called mukakee mindemoea , or the toad - woman . the mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit , and as she flew along , she came , from time to time , to lodges inhabited by old women , who told her at what time the child - thief had passed ; they also gave her shoes that she might follow on . there was a number of these old women who seemed as if they were prophetesses , and knew what was to come long beforehand . each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at the next lodge , she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given her pointing homeward , and that they would return of themselves . the young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes she borrowed .
