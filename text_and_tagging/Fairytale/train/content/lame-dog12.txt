at that a little toad hopped out from under the stone , and said : " lovely maiden , why do you sit here and weep ? " and the princess answered : " it is my hard fate to weep and never be happy again . first of all i have lost the love of my heart , and now i can no longer find my way back to the castle . so i must perish of hunger here , or else be devoured by wild beasts . " " o , " said the toad , " if that is all that troubles you , i can help you ! if you will promise to be my dearest friend , i will show you the way . " but that the princess did not want to do . she replied : " ask of me what you will , save that alone . i have never loved any one more than my lame dog , and so long as i live will never love any one else better . " with that she rose , wept bitterly , and continued her way . but the toad looked after her in a friendly manner , laughed to himself , and once more crept under his stone .
