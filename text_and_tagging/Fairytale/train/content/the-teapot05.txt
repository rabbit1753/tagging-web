" earth was placed in me . for a teapot , this is the same as being buried , but in the earth was placed a flower bulb . who placed it there , who gave it , i know not ; but given it was , and it became a compensation for the chinese leaves and the boiling water , a compensation for the broken handle and spout . " and the bulb lay in the earth , the bulb lay in me ; it became my heart , my living heart , such as i had never before possessed . there was life in me , power and might . the heart pulsed , and the bulb put forth sprouts ; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower . " i saw it , i bore it , i forgot myself in its delight . blessed is it to forget oneself in another . the flower gave me no thanks ; it did not think of me . it was admired and praised , and i was glad at that . how happy it must have been ! one day i heard some one say that the flower deserved a better pot . i was thumped hard on my back , which was a great affliction , and the flower was put into a better pot . i was thrown out into the yard , where i lie as an old potsherd . but i have the memory , and that i can never lose .
