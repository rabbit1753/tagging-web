when the dance was over , the king asked the youth what he asked as a reward for having given him such a pleasure . the youth answered : " my lord king , i did not come to you to win gold and gear . but i have another request to make : that you allow me to set out and search for your three daughters , carried away by a mountain troll . " when the king heard this his thoughts once more grew gloomy , and he replied : " you need not even think of delivering my daughters . it is no child 's play , and your betters have already attempted it in vain . yet should it really come to pass that you deliver one of the princesses , you may be sure that i will not break my word . " so he took leave of the king and set forth . and he decided to take no rest until he had found what he sought .
