" just wait a little while , " said the old woman to halvor . " the west wind will be right along , and he is sure to know , for he sweeps and blows about in every corner . well , i declare , you have a horse , too ! " said the old woman when she came in again . " now do n't let the poor beast stand by the door there and starve to death ; but take it out to the pasture instead . or would you like to change with me ? we have a pair of old boots , that carry you twelve miles further with every step . i will give them to you in exchange for the horse , and then you will reach soria - moria castle more quickly . " halvor at once agreed , and the old woman was so pleased with the horse , that she almost started dancing then and there . " for now i can ride to church , too , " said she .
