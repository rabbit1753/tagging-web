hase - hime listened in an attitude of respect while her mother spoke , and promised to do all that she was told . there is a proverb which says " as the soul is at three so it is at one hundred , " and so hase - hime grew up as her mother had wished , a good and obedient little princess , though she was now too young to understand how great was the loss of her mother . not long after the death of his first wife , prince toyonari married again , a lady of noble birth named princess terute . very different in character , alas ! to the good and wise princess murasaki , this woman had a cruel , bad heart . she did not love her step - daughter at all , and was often very unkind to the little motherless girl , saving to herself : " this is not my child ! this is not my child ! " and never having learned to control herself , she allowed this wicked thought to grow into the awful desire of taking her step - daughter 's life . so one day she secretly ordered some poison and poisoned some sweet wine . this poisoned wine she put into a bottle . into another similar bottle she poured some good wine . it was the occasion of the boys ' festival on the fifth of may , and hase - hime was playing with her little brother . all his toys of warriors and heroes were spread out and she was telling him wonderful stories about each of them . they were both enjoying themselves and laughing merrily with their attendants when his mother entered with the two bottles of wine and some delicious cakes .
