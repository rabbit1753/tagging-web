apparently she was bent on the chase , for she carried a hunting - horn and a sheaf of arrows ; and she led seven greyhounds along in a leash , while as many scenting hounds ran loose at her horse 's side . as she rode down the glen , she lilted a bit of an old scotch song ; and she carried herself with such a queenly air , and her dress was so magnificent , that thomas was like to kneel by the side of the path and worship her , for he thought that it must be the blessed virgin herself . but when the rider came to where he was , and understood his thoughts , she shook her head sadly .
