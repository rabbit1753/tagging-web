in this fashion the two friends provided themselves with all the game to be found in the woods and in the water , and spread terror and destruction throughout the countryside . but one evening , when they were just returning to the sea from an excursion , a black cloud came up , and a tempest broke . they hurried along as fast as they could ; but got no further than vattjom , where a flash of lightning struck starkad and flung him to the ground . his friend and companion - at - arms buried him beneath a stone cairn , about which he set five rocks : two at his feet , two at his shoulders , and one at his head ; and that grave , measuring twenty ells in length , may still be seen near the river .
