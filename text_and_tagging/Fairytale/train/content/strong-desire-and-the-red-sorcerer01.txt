there was a man called odshedoph , or the child of strong desires , who had a wife and one son . he had withdrawn his family from the village , where they had spent the winter , to the neighborhood of a distant forest , where game abounded . this wood was a day 's travel from his winter home , and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge , while the husband went out to hunt . early in the evening he returned with a deer , and , being weary and athirst , he asked his son , whom he called strong desire , to go to the river for some water . the son replied that it was dark , and he was afraid . his father still urged him , saying that his mother , as well as himself , was tired , and the distance to the water very short . but no persuasion could overcome the young man 's reluctance . he refused to go .
