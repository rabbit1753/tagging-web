one day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting expedition , and looked about for a nice , cool spot in which to pitch their camp . it was very hot , and they thought that they could not find a more comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which grew by the bank of a river . so they made their fire to cook some food , right on the edge of a steep bank , which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it at the bottom . while the food was cooking they all stretched themselves lazily out under the tree , and were just dropping off to sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun , and heavy drops of rain began to fall , so that the fire was almost put out , and that , you know , is a very serious thing in savage countries where they have no matches , for it is very hard to light it again . to make matters worse , an icy wind began to blow , and the poor fishes were chilled right through their bodies . ' this will never do , ' said thuggai , the oldest of the fish tribe . ' we shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again , ' and he bade his sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame , but though they rubbed till they were tired , not a spark could they produce .
