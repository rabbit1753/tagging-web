with the speed of lightning the cousin rushed forward . " netawis ! netawis ! " he cried , " is it indeed you ? whence have you come , oh , my cousin ? " they fell upon each other 's necks , and wept aloud . and then , without further delay or question , the cousin ran off with breathless dispatch to the village . he seemed like a shadow upon the open ground , he sped so fast . he entered the lodge where sat the mother of wassamo in mourning for her son . " hear me , " said the cousin . " i have seen him whom you accuse me of having killed . he will be here even while we speak . " he had scarcely uttered these words when the whole village was astir in an instant . all ran out and strained their eyes to catch the first view of him whom they had thought dead . and when wassamo came forward , they at first fell from him as though he had been in truth one returned from the spirit - land . he entered the lodge of his parents . they saw that it was wassamo , living , breathing and as they had ever known him . and joy lit up the lodge - circle as though a new fire had been kindled in the eyes of his friends and kinsfolk .
