the wise man said : " there are four paths in this cave . one path leads to the south - west shore of the sea of dungting , the second path leads to a valley in the land of the four rivers , the third path ends in a cave on the mountain of lo - fu and the fourth in an island of the eastern sea . in this cave dwells the seventh daughter of the dragon - king of the eastern sea , who guards his pearls and his treasure . it happened once in the ancient days , that a fisherboy dived into the water and brought up a pearl from beneath the chin of a black dragon . the dragon was asleep , which was the reason the fisherboy brought the pearl to the surface without being harmed . the treasure which the daughter of the dragon - king has in charge is made up of thousands and millions of such jewels . several thousands of small dragons watch over them in her service . dragons have the peculiarity of fighting shy of wax . but they are fond of beautiful jade - stones , and of kung - tsing , the hollowgreen wood , and like to eat swallows . if one were to send a messenger with a letter , it would be possible to obtain precious pearls .
