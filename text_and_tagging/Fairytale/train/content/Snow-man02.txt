" there it comes again , from the other side , " said the snow man , who supposed the sun was showing himself once more . " ah , i have cured him of staring , though . now he may hang up there , and shine , that i may see myself . if i only knew how to manage to move away from this place,--i should so like to move . if i could , i would slide along yonder on the ice , as i have seen the boys do . but i do n't understand how . i do n't even know how to run . " " away , away , " barked the old yard - dog . he was quite hoarse , and could not pronounce " bow wow " properly . he had once been an indoor dog , and lay by the fire , and he had been hoarse ever since . " the sun will make you run some day . i saw him , last winter , make your predecessor run , and his predecessor before him . away , away , they all have to go . " " i do n't understand you , comrade , " said the snow man . " is that thing up yonder to teach me to run ? i saw it running itself a little while ago , and now it has come creeping up from the other side . "
