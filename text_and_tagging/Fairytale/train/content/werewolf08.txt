as time passed on , the king 's daughter had grown to be the most beautiful maiden to be found far and wide . the queen 's daughters , on the other hand , were homely , evil of disposition , and no one knew any good of them . hence it was not surprising that many youths came from east and west to sue for the princess 's hand ; but that none of them took any interest in the queen 's daughters . this made the step - mother very angry ; . she concealed her rage , and was as sweet and friendly as ever . among the wooers was a king 's son from another country . he was young and brave , and since he loved the princess dearly , she accepted his proposal and they plighted their troth . the queen observed this with an angry eye , for it would have pleased her had the prince chosen one of her own daughters . she therefor made up her mind that the young pair should never be happy together , and from that time on thought only of how she might part them from each other .
