west of gingdschou , two hundred miles away , is another lake , whose god is named tschauna , and who performs many miracles . during the time of the tang dynasty there lived in gingdschou a mandarin by name of dschou bau . while he was in office it chanced that in the fifth month clouds suddenly arose in the sky , piling themselves up like mountains , among which wriggled dragons and serpents ; they rolled up and down between the two seas . tempest and rain , thunder and lightning arose so that houses fell to pieces , trees were torn up by the roots , and much damage was done the crops . dschou bau took the blame upon himself , and prayed to the heavens that his people might be pardoned .
