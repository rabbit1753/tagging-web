there was a man called odshedoph , or the child of strong desires , who had a wife and one son . he had withdrawn his family from the village , where they had spent the winter , to the neighborhood of a distant forest , where game abounded . this wood was a day 's travel from his winter home , and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge , while the husband went out to hunt . early in the evening he returned with a deer , and , being weary and athirst , he asked his son , whom he called strong desire , to go to the river for some water . the son replied that it was dark , and he was afraid . his father still urged him , saying that his mother , as well as himself , was tired , and the distance to the water very short . but no persuasion could overcome the young man 's reluctance . he refused to go . " ah , my son , " said the father , at last , " if you are afraid to go to the river , you will never kill the red head . " the stripling was deeply vexed by this observation ; it seemed to touch him to the very quick . he mused in silence . he refused to eat , and made no reply when spoken to . he sat by the lodge door all the night through , looking up at the stars , and sighing like one sorely distressed . the next day he asked his mother to dress the skin of the deer , and to make it into moccasins for him , while he busied himself in preparing a bow and arrows . as soon as these were in readiness , he left the lodge one morning , at sunrise , without saying a word to his father or mother . as he passed along , he fired one of his arrows into the air , which fell westward . he took that course , and coming to the spot where the arrow had fallen , he was rejoiced to find it piercing the heart of a deer .
