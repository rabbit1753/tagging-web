after he had traveled a way , he grew very warm and thirsty . there was no water to be found , and he did not know how he was to refresh himself . then the lemons occurred to him , and he took one and bit into it . but in it sat a princess , visible up to her arms , and cried : " water , water ! " if she could not have some water , said she , she must die . the youth ran about everywhere like mad , looking for water ; but there was no water there , and none to be found , and when he returned she was dead . after he had gone on again a while , he grew still more thirsty , and since he found nothing with which to refresh himself , he took another lemon and bit into it . and another princess looked out , up to her shoulders , and she was even more beautiful than the first . she cried for water , and said that if she could not have some water she must die on the spot . mike by the stove ran about and looked under stones and moss ; but he found no water , so this princess also died .
