' the princess in her fright exclaimed , ' that is the crab himself ! ' her mother was still more angry because she had not been told sooner , ran into her daughter 's room where the crab - shell was still lying , took it up and threw it into the fire . then the poor princess cried bitterly , but it was of no use ; her husband did not come back .
