the man hesitated . it did seem a ' little thing . ' if it was to make his wife contented and happy it was well worth the risk . so he took hold of the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully , while the woman stooped down to peep . suddenly she startled back with a scream . for a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen , and had nearly hit her in the eye . round and round the room it ran . round and round they both ran after it , knocking down chairs and vases in their efforts to catch the mouse and put it back in the tureen . in the middle of all the noise the door opened . the mouse ran out between the feet of the king . in one instant both the man and his wife were hiding under the table . to all appearance the room was empty . ' you may as well come out , ' said the king , ' and hear what i have to say . ' ' i know what it is , ' answered the charcoal - burner , hanging his head . ' the mouse has escaped . ' ' a guard of soldiers will take you back to your hut , ' said the king . ' your wife has the key . ' ' were n't they silly ? ' cried the grandchildren of the charcoal - burners when they heard the story . ' how we wish that we had had the chance ! we should never have wanted to know what was in the soup - tureen ! '
