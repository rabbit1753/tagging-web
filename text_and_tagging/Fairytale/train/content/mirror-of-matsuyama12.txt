in the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold , and were not particularly anxious . but the days went by and still the mother did not get better . she only grew worse , and the doctor was puzzled , for in spite of all he did the poor woman grew weaker day by day . the father and daughter were stricken with grief , and day or night the girl never left her mother 's side . but in spite of all their efforts the woman 's life was not to be saved . one day as the girl sat near her mother 's bed , trying to hide with a cheery smile the gnawing trouble at her heart , the mother roused herself and taking her daughter 's hand , gazed earnestly and lovingly into her eyes . her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty : " my daughter . i am sure that nothing can save me now . when i am dead , promise me to take care of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman . " " oh , mother , " said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes , " you must not say such things . all you have to do is to make haste and get well - that will bring the greatest happiness to father and myself . " " yes , i know , and it is a comfort to me in my last days to know how greatly you long for me to get better , but it is not to be . do not look so sorrowful , for it was so ordained in my previous state of existence that i should die in this life just at this time . knowing this , i am quite resigned to my fate . and now i have something to give you whereby to remember me when i am gone .
