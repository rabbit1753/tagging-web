when they came into the palace yard , the king himself opened the carriage door , for respect to his new son - in - law . as soon as he turned the handle , a shower of small stones fell on his powdered wig and his silk coat , and down he fell under them . there was great fright and some laughter , and the king , after he wiped the blood from his forehead , looked very cross at the eldest prince . ' my lord , ' says he , ' i 'm very sorry for this accident , but i 'm not to blame . i saw the young smith get into the carriage , and we never stopped a minute since . ' ' it 's uncivil you were to him . go , ' says he to the other prince , ' and bring the young smith here , and be polite . ' ' never fear , ' says he . but there 's some people that could n't be good - natured if they tried , and not a bit civiller was the new messenger than the old , and when the king opened the carriage door a second time , it 's shower of mud that came down on him . ' there 's no use , ' says he , ' going on this way . the fox never got a better messenger than himself . '
