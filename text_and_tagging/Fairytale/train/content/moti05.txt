now the afghans began to look a little uncomfortable , but moti seemed so determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law , so they went off and laid a complaint before the king that moti had stolen one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it . presently a soldier came to summon moti to the king ; and , when he arrived and made his obeisance , the king began to question him as to why he had galloped off with the horse in this fashion . but moti declared that he had got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver , whilst the horse merchants vowed that the money they had on them was what they had received for the sale of other horses ; and in one way and another the dispute got so confusing that the king ( who really thought that moti had stolen the horse ) said at last , ' well , i tell you what i will do . i will lock something into this box before me , and if he guesses what it is , the horse is his , and if he does n't then it is yours . ' to this moti agreed , and the king arose and went out alone by a little door at the back of the court , and presently came back clasping something closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe , slipped it into the little box , locked the box , and set it up where all might see .
