once upon a time there were three brothers who had lost their parents , and since the latter had left their sons nothing upon which to live , they had to wander out into the world , and seek their fortune . the two older brothers prepared for the journey as well as they were able ; but the youngest , whom they called " mike by the stove , " because he was always sitting behind the stove whittling , they did not want to take with them . so they set out at early dawn ; yet for all their hurrying mike by the stove reached the king 's court as soon as they did . when they got there , they asked to be taken into the king 's service . well , said the king , he really had no work for them to do ; but since they were so poor , he would see that they were kept busy ; there was always something or other to do in such a big establishment : they could drive nails into the wall , and when they were through , they could pull them out again . and when that was done , they could carry wood and water into the kitchen . mike by the stove was quickest at driving his nails into the wall , and pulling them out again , and he had been quick , too , about carrying his wood and water . therefore his brothers grew jealous , and said he had declared he could obtain the most beautiful princess in twelve kingdoms for the king -- for the king 's wife had died and he was a widower . when the king heard this , he told mike by the stove he had better do as he had said , else he would have him brought to the block , and his head chopped off .
