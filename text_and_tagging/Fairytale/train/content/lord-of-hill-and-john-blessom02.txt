" you are walking very fast , " said john . " yes , but then i 'm in a hurry , " answered the man . " i have to get back to vaage this very evening . " " i only wish that i could get there ! " sighed john . " you can stand on the runner of my sledge , " said the man , " for i have a horse that covers a mile in twelve steps . " so they set out , and blessom had all that he could do to hold fast to the runner of the sledge ; for they went through weather and wind , and he could see neither heaven nor earth . once they stopped and rested . he could not tell exactly where it was , but when they began to hurry on again , he thought that he spied a skull on a pole . after they had gone on a while , john blessom began to freeze .
