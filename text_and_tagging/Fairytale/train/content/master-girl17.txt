on the third day the magistrate came by , and also saw the little golden house in the forest . and he , too , went in to see who lived in it . and when he saw the master girl , he fell so deeply in love with her that he sued for her hand as soon as he bade her good - day . but she told him just what she had told the others , that if he had plenty of money she would take him . he had money enough , said the magistrate , and he went straight home to fetch it . when he came back in the evening , he had a much bigger sack of money with him than the clerk had had , and he stood it on the bench . then the master girl said she would take him . but first she asked him to go fetch the calf , which she had forgotten to bring to the stable . and when he had the calf by the tail she cried : " may god grant that you hold the calf 's tail , and the calf 's tail hold you , and that you fly about the world together until morning ! " and with that the race began , over stick and stone , over hill and dale , and the more the magistrate cursed and yelled , the more madly the calf ran away . when it dawned there was hardly a whole bone in the magistrate 's body , and he was so happy to be able to let go the calf 's tail that he forgot his bag of money , and the whole occurrence . it is true that he went home more slowly than the bailiff and the clerk ; but the slower he went the more time the people had to stare and grin at him , so ragged and badly beaten did he appear after his dance with the calf .
