in a little lodge at a beautiful spot on a lake shore , alone with his sister , lived a boy remarkable for the smallness of his stature . many large rocks were scattered around their habitation , and it had a very wild and out - of - the - way look . the boy grew no larger as he advanced in years . yet , small as he was , he had a big spirit of his own , and loved dearly to play the master in the lodge . one day in winter he told his sister to make him a ball to play with . he meant to have some sport along the shore on the clear ice . when she handed him the ball , his sister cautioned him not to go too far . he laughed at her , and ran off in high glee , throwing his ball before him and running after it at full speed . he went as fast as his ball . at last his ball flew to a great distance . he followed as fast as he could . after he had run forward for some time , he saw what seemed four dark spots upon the ice , straight before him .
