by and bye they arrived at the house in a tree where the snake lived , when he was not travelling with his father and mother . and he told them all his adventures , and how he had escaped from his enemy . the father and mother snake could not do enough to show their gratitude . they made their guest lie down on a hammock woven of the strong creepers which hung from bough to bough , till she was quite rested after her wanderings , while they watched the baby and gave him milk to drink from the cocoa - nuts which they persuaded their friends the monkeys to crack for them . they even managed to carry small fruit tied up in their tails for the baby 's mother , who felt at last that she was safe and at peace . not that she forgot her husband , for she often thought of him and longed to show him her son , and in the night she would sometimes lie awake and wonder where he was .
