now once , at the time of the hay harvest , he was home at baekkjen , and had lain down to take a little after - dinner nap under the penthouse . and he was taken into the hill , which happened in the following way : a man with a pair of gilded goat 's horns came along and butted ola , but ola fell upon him so that the man had to duck back , again and again . but the stranger stood up once more , and began to butt again . finally he took ola under his arm like a glove , and then both of them flew straight off into the hill .
