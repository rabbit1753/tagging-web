just such a farmhouse as this stood in a country lane , and in it dwelt an old couple , a peasant and his wife . small as their possessions were , they had one thing they could not do without , and that was a horse , which contrived to live upon the grass found by the side of the highroad . the old peasant rode into the town upon this horse , and his neighbors often borrowed it of him and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple . yet after a time the old people thought it would be as well to sell the horse or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them . but what should this _ something _ be ?
