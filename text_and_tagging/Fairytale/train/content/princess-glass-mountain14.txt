and now our story turns to the king who was reigning at the splendid castle . he had been married , and he had an only daughter . she was lovelier by far than other maidens , and had so kind and cheerful a disposition that whoever could some day take her to his home might well consider himself fortunate . now when the princess had completed her fifteenth year , a quite unheard of swarm of suitors made their appearance , as may well be imagined ; and for all that she said no to all of them , they only increased in number . at last the princess said : " none other shall win me save he who can ride up the high glass mountain in full armor ! " the king thought this a good suggestion . he approved of his daughter 's wish , and had proclaimed throughout the kingdom that none other should have the princess save he who could ride up the glass mountain .
