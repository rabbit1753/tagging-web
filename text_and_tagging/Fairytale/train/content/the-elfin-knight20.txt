as he retraced his steps , awesome and terrible were the sounds that he heard around him . the ravens shrieked , and the frozen goblins screamed ; and up from the hidden lake below came the sound of the deep breathing of the awful monster who was lurking there , eager for prey . but the brave earl heeded none of these things , but kept steadily onwards , trusting in the might of the sign he bore . and it carried him safely through all the dangers ; and just as the sound of the matin bell was dying away in the morning air he stepped on to solid ground once more , and flung the enchanted goblet from him . and lo ! every one of the frozen elves vanished , along with their king and his marble table , and nothing was left on the rank green grass save earl gregory , who slowly woke from his enchanted slumber , and stretched himself , and stood up , shaking in every limb . he gazed vaguely round him , as if he scarce remembered where he was . and when , after earl st . clair had run to him and had held him in his arms till his senses returned and the warm blood coursed through his veins , the two friends returned to the spot where earl st . clair had thrown down the wondrous goblet , they found nothing but a piece of rough grey whinstone , with a drop of dew hidden in a little crevice which was hollowed in its side .
