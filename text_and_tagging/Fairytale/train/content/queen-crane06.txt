the following day the king once more had to take the field . and sheep - peter came to him and said he wanted to go along . so they gave him an old nag to ride , and he rode into a swamp beside the highway . then he sat down and clicked with his tongue ; but the horse would not move . when the people rode by they had their sport with him ; but the youth pretended to feel sad , so sad . when the people had gone by , he went to the oak in which the queen crane dwelt , and was given a white steed , a suit of silver armor , and a golden sword . thus equipped he rode to battle . when he arrived he said : " god aid me , and queen crane ... and i will succeed ! " but he had forgotten to say " stay by me , " and so he was shot in the leg . but the king took out his handkerchief , and tied up his leg . then the youth said once more : " god aid me , and queen crane stay by me , and i will succeed ! " and he slew all of the enemy . then the king thought he was an angel from heaven , and wanted to hold him . but the youth rode quickly to the oak , took off his armor , and then went down to his nag in the swamp and tried to get it to move , while the soldiers were passing . they laughed and said : " you were not along to - day , and did not see how an angel came from heaven and killed all of the enemy . " the youth pretended to be very sad .
