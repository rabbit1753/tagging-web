' comfort yourself , ' said the stranger kindly ; ' they shall neither send your husband to prison nor sell your goods . i will not only pay his debts but , if he dies , the cost of his burial also . and now go home , and nurse him as well as you can . ' and so she did ; but , in spite of her care , the husband died , and was buried by the stranger . but everything cost more than he expected , and when all was paid he found that only three gold pieces were left . ' what am i to do now ? ' said he to himself . ' i think i had better go to court , and enter into the service of the king . '
