he sprang up , and discovered at a distance the figure of a human being , walking with a stick . he looked attentively , and saw that the figure was walking in a wide beaten path in a prairie , leading from a dusky lodge to a lake , whose waters were black and turbid . to his surprise , this lodge , which had not been in view when he cast himself upon the ground , was now near at hand . he approached a little nearer , and concealed himself ; and in a moment he discovered that the figure was no other than that of the terrible witch , the little old woman who makes war . her path to the lake was perfectly smooth and solid , and the noise strong desire had heard was caused by the striking of her walking staff upon the ground . the top of this staff was decorated with a string of the toes and bills of birds of every kind , who , at every stroke of the stick , fluttered and sung their various notes in concert .
