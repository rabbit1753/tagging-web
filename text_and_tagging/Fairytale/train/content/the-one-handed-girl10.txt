for seven days she wandered about , eating only the fruit that hung from the trees above her , and every night she climbed up and tucked herself safely among the creepers which bound together the big branches , so that neither lions nor tigers nor panthers might get at her . when she woke up on the seventh morning she saw from her perch smoke coming up from a little town on the edge of the forest . the sight of the huts made her feel more lonely and helpless than before . she longed desperately for a draught of milk from a gourd , for there were no streams in that part , and she was very thirsty , but how was she to earn anything with only one hand ? and at this thought her courage failed , and she began to cry bitterly . it happened that the king 's son had come out from the town very early to shoot birds , and when the sun grew hot he left tired .
