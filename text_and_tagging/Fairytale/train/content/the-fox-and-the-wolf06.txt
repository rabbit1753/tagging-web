so that evening the fox was absent , and the wolf was alone in the cave . but it was not to a christening that the sly fox went ; it was to the keg of butter that was buried in the sand . about midnight he returned , looking fat and sleek , and well pleased with himself . the wolf had been dozing , but he looked up drowsily as his companion entered . " well , how did they name the bairn ? " he asked . " they gave it a queer name , " answered the fox . " one of the queerest names that i ever heard . " " and what was that ? " questioned the wolf . " nothing less than ' blaisean ' ( let - me - taste ) , " replied the fox , throwing himself down in his corner . and if the wolf could have seen him in the darkness he would have noticed that he was laughing to himself .
