if she found the rye bread too hard to bake , or the oven taking too long to heat , she just murmured , ' i should like to see my six loaves on the shelf above the bread box , ' and two hours after there they were . if she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road , she would say out loud the night before , ' why am i not already back from morlaix with my milk pot empty , my butter bowl inside it , a pound of wild cherries on my wooden plate , and the money i have gained in my apron pocket ? ' and in the morning when she got up , lo and behold ! there were standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter bowl inside , the black cherries on the wooden plate , and six new pieces of silver in the pocket of her apron . and she believed that all this was owing to jegu , and she could no longer do without him , even in her thoughts .
