for some hours all went well ; and in the heat of the chase the young men forgot their fears . then suddenly both of them reined in their steeds and sat gazing in front of them with affrighted faces . for a horseman had crossed their track , and they both would fain have known who he was and whence he came . " by my troth , but he rideth in haste , whoever he may be , " said earl gregory at last , " and though i always thought that no steed on earth could match mine for swiftness , i reckon that for every league that mine goeth , his would go seven . let us follow him , and see from what part of the world he cometh . " " the lord forbid that thou shouldst stir thy horse 's feet to follow him , " said earl st . clair devoutly . " why , man , it is the elfin knight ! canst thou not see that he doth not ride on the solid ground , but flieth through the air , and that , although he rideth on what seemeth a mortal steed , he is really craried by mighty pinions , which cleave the air like those of a bird ? follow him forsooth ! it will be an evil day for thee when thou seekest to do that .
