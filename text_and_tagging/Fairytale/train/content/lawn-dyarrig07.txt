" who will go now ? " said lawn dyarrig . " who will go but me ? " answered arthur . whatever length ur went , arthur did n't go the half of it . " by my father , and the tooth of my father , i would n't give another look at terrible valley for all that 's in erin , dead or alive ! " " i will go now , " said lawn dyarrig , " and as i put no foul play on you , i hope ye'll not put foul play on me . " " we will not , indeed , " said they . whatever length the other two went , lawn dyarrig did n't go the half of it , till he stepped out of the basket and went down on his own feet . it was not far he had travelled in terrible valley when he met seven hundred heroes guarding the country . " in what place here has the green king his castle ? " asked he of the seven hundred . " what sort of a sprisawn goat or sheep from erin are you ? " asked they . " if we had a hold of you , the two arms of me , that 's a question you would not put a second time ; but if we have n't you , we 'll not be so long . " they faced lawn dyarrig then and attacked him ; but he went through them like a hawk or a raven through small birds . he made a heap of their feet , a heap of their heads , and a castle of their arms .
