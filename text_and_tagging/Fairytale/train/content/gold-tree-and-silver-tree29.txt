that one thing was that there was one room in the castle -- a room which stood at the end of a passage by itself -- which she could never enter , as her husband always carried the key . and as , when she asked him the reason of this , he always made an excuse of some kind . she made up her mind that she would not seem as if she did not trust him , so she asked no more questions about the matter . but one day the prince chanced to leave the door unlocked . as he had never told her not to do so , she went in . there she saw princess gold - tree lying on the silken couch , looking as if she were asleep . " is she dead , or is she only sleeping ? " she said to herself . she went up to the couch and looked closely at the princess . and there , sticking in her little finger , she discovered a curiously shaped needle . " there hath been evil work here , " she thought to herself . " if that needle be not poisoned , then i know naught of medicine . " and , being skilled in leechcraft , she drew it carefully out .
