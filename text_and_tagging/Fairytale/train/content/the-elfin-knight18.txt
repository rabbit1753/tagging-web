so saying the grisly goblin stepped back among his companions , leaving earl st . clair standing alone on the outskirts of the charmed ring . there he waited , shivering with cold , through the long , dark hours , till the grey dawn began to break over the hill tops , and , with its coming , the elfin forms before him seemed to dwindle and fade away . and at the hour when the sound of the matin bell came softly pealing from across the moor , he began his solemn walk . round and round the ring he paced , keeping steadily on his way , although loud murmurs of anger , like distant thunder , rose from the elfin shades , and even the very ground seemed to heave and quiver , as if it would shake this bold intruder from its surface . but through the power of the blessed sign on his arm earl st . clair went on unhurt .
