the first time they put out a great storm was raging . one of the sons sat at the rudder , the second at the bow , and the third in the middle . isaac had to work with the bailing - can until he dripped perspiration . they sailed as though they were mad . they never reefed a sail , and when the boat was full of water , they danced on the crests of the waves , and slid down them so that the water in the stern spurted up like a fountain . after a time the storm subsided , and they began to fish . and the sea was so full of fish that they could not even put out an anchor , since mountains of fish were piled up beneath them . the sons of udrost drew up one fish after another . isaac knew his business ; but he had taken along his own fishing - tackle , and as soon as a fish bit he let go again , and at last he had caught not a single one . when the boat was filled , they sailed home again to udrost , and the sons cleaned the fish , and laid them on the stands . meanwhile isaac had complained to their father of his poor luck . the man promised that he should do better next time , and gave him a couple of hooks . the next time they went out to fish , isaac caught just as many as the others , and when they reached home , he was given three stands of fish as his share .
