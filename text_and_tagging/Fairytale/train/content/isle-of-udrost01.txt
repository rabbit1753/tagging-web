once upon a time there lived at vaero , not far from rost , a poor fisherman , named isaac . he had nothing but a boat and a couple of goats , which his wife fed as well as she could with fish leavings , and with the grass she was able to gather on the surrounding hills . but his whole hut was full of hungry children . yet he was always satisfied with what god sent him . the only thing that worried him was his inability to live at peace with his neighbor . the latter was a rich man , thought himself entitled to far more than such a beggarly fellow as isaac . he wanted to get him out of the way , in order to take for himself the anchorage before isaac 's hut .
