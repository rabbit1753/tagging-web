" look in my face , father , and surely you 'll remember me . " " my daughter is dead and buried . she died a long , long time ago . " the old gentleman 's voice changed from anger to sorrow . " you can go , " he concluded . " stop , dear father , till you look at this ring on my finger . look at your name and mine engraved on it . " " it certainly is my daughter 's ring , but i do not know how you came by it . i fear in no honest way . " " call my mother -- she will be sure to know me , " said the poor girl , who by this time was weeping bitterly . " my poor wife is beginning to forget her sorrow . she seldom speaks of her daughter now . why should i renew her grief by reminding her of her loss ? " but the young lady persevered till at last the mother was sent for . " mother , " she began , when the old lady came to the door , " do n't you know your daughter ? " " i have no daughter . my daughter died , and was buried a long , long time ago . " " only look in my face and surely you 'll know me . " the old lady shook her head . " you have all forgotten me . but look at this mole on my neck . surely , mother , you know me now ? " " yes , yes , " said her mother , " my gracie had a mole on her neck like that . but then i saw her in the coffin , and saw the lid shut down upon her . "
