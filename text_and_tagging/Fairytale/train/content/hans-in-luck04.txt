" well now , " said the peasant , " since it will be doing you such a favour , i do n't mind exchanging my cow for your horse . " hans agreed most joyfully , and the peasant , swinging himself into the saddle , was soon out of sight . and hans went along driving his cow quietly before him , and thinking all the while of the fine bargain he had made . " with only a piece of bread i shall have everything i can possibly want , for i shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it . if i am thirsty i have nothing to do but to milk my cow . what more is there for heart to wish !
