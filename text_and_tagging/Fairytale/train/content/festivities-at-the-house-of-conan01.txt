" win victory and blessings , o fionn , " said conan , " and tell me who was the man that , having only one leg , one arm , and one eye , escaped from you in consequence of his swiftness . who outstripped the fenians of eire , and why is this proverb used , ' as roc came to the house of fionn ' ? " " i will tell you that , " said fionn . " one day the chief of the fenians and i went to teamhair luachra . we took nothing in the chase that same day but one fawn . when it had been cooked it was fetched to me for the purpose of dividing it . i gave a portion of it to each of the fenian chiefs , and there remained none for my own share but a haunch bone . gobha gaoithe , son of ronan , presented himself , and requested me to give him the haunch . i accordingly gave it to him . he then declared that i gave him that portion on account of his swiftness of foot . he went out on the plain , but he had only gone a short distance when caoilte , son of ronan , his own brother , overtook him , and brought the haunch back again to me , and we had no further dispute about the matter . we had not been long so when we saw a huge , obnoxious , massy - boned , black , detestable giant , having only one eye , one arm , and one leg , hop forward towards us . he saluted us . i returned the salutation , and asked him whence he came .
