the sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest . at last he perceived a narrow foot - path , which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut . the maidens , who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness , saw him approaching , and the two elder were much alarmed , for they remembered the old woman 's warning ; but the youngest said : " never before have i seen anyone like him ; let me have one look . " they entreated her to come in , but , seeing that she would not , left her , and the prince , coming up , courteously greeted the maiden , and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary . she set food before him , and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman 's caution , and lingered for hours . in the meantime the prince 's companions sought him far and wide , but to no purpose , so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the king , who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him .
