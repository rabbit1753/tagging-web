there was also in the house a ram with a white belly , a jet - black head , dark - green horns , and green feet ; and there was in the end of the house a hag covered with a dark ash - coloured garment . there were no persons in the house except these . the man at the door - post welcomed us ; and we five , having our five hounds with us , sat on the floor of the bruighean . ' let submissive homage be done to fionn mac cumhaill and his people , ' said the man at the door - post . ' my case is that of a man begging a request , but obtaining neither the smaller nor the greater part of it , ' said the giant . nevertheless , he rose up and did respectful homage to us . after a while i became suddenly thirsty , and no person present perceived it but caoilte , who began to complain bitterly on that account . ' you have no cause to complain , caoilte , ' said the man of the door - post , ' but only to step outside and fetch a drink for fionn from whichever of the fountains you please . ' caoilte did so , and fetched the bronze vessel brimful to me and gave me to drink . i took a drink from it , and the water tasted like honey while i was drinking , but bitter as gall when i put the vessel from my lips ; so that darting pains and symptoms of death seized me and agonising pangs from the poisonous draught . i could be but with difficulty recognised ; and the lamentation of caoilte on account of my being in that condition was greater than that he had before given vent to on account of my thirst . the man at the door - post desired caoilte to go out and bring me a drink from the other fountain . caoilte obeyed , and brought me the iron vessel brimful . i never underwent so much hardship in battle or conflict as i then suffered while drinking , in consequence of the bitterness of the draught ; but as soon as i put the vessel from my lips i recovered my own colour and appearance , and that gave joy and happiness to my people .
