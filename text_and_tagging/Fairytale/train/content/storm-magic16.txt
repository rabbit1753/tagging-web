" if they buy three cords of birch - wood , " said the witch,--"but it must be full measure , and they must not bargain for it -- and throw the first cord into the water , billet by billet , when the first breaker strikes , and the second cord , billet by billet , when the second breaker strikes , and the third cord , billet by billet , when the third breaker strikes , then it is all up with us ! " " yes , that 's true , sister , then it is all up with us ! then it is all up with us ! " said the wives of the quartermasters ; " but there is no one who knows it , " they cried , and laughed loudly , and with that they flew out of the hatchway , screaming and croaking like ravens . the boy ordered them to throw the first cord of birch - wood overboard , billet by billet , one at a time and never two , and he did not let them touch the other two cords . now they obeyed him to the letter , and did not laugh ; but cast out the birch - wood billet by billet . when the last billet fell they heard a groaning , as though some one were wrestling with death , and then the squall had passed . " heaven be praised ! " said the crew -- and the captain added : " i am going to let the company know that you saved ship and cargo . "
