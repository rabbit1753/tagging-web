cinderella brought the trap to her , and in it there were three huge rats . the fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard , and , having touched him with her wand , he was turned into a fat , jolly coachman , who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld . after that , she said to her : " go again into the garden , and you will find six lizards behind the watering - pot , bring them to me . " she had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen , who skipped up immediately behind the coach , with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver , and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives . the fairy then said to cinderella : " well , you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with ; are you not pleased with it ? " " oh ! yes , " cried she ; " but must i go there as i am , in these nasty rags ? "
