at the time of the seven empires there lived a man by the name of si - men bau , who was a governor on the yellow river . in this district the river - god was held in high honor . the sorcerers and witches who dwelt there said : " every year the river - god looks for a bride , who must be selected from among the people . if she be not found then wind and rain will not come at the proper seasons . there will be scanty crops and floods ! " and then , when a girl came of age in some wealthy family , the sorcerers would say that she should be selected . whereupon her parents , who wished to protect their daughter , would bribe them with large sums of money to look for some one else , till the sorcerers would give in . they would order the rich folk to share the expense of buying some poor girl to be cast into the river . the remainder of the money they would keep for themselves as their profit on the transaction . but whoever would not pay , their daughter was chosen to be the bride of the river - god . she was forced to accept the wedding gifts which the sorcerers brought her . the people of the district chafed grievously under this custom .
