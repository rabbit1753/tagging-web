but the spiritual part of notscha , his soul , fluttered about in the air , and was driven by the wind to the cave of the great one . he took it in and said to it : " you must appear to your mother ! forty miles distant from your home rises a green mountain cliff . on this cliff she must build a shrine for you . and after you have enjoyed the incense of human adoration for three years , you shall once more have a human body . " notscha appeared to his mother in a dream , and gave her the whole message , and she awoke in tears . but li dsing grew angry when she told him about it . " it serves the accursed boy right that he is dead ! it is because you are always thinking of him that he appears to you in dreams . you must pay no attention to him . " the woman said no more , but thenceforward he appeared to her daily , as soon as she closed her eyes , and grew more and more urgent in his demand . finally all that was left for her to do was to erect a temple for notscha without li dsing 's knowledge . and notscha performed great miracles in his temple . all prayers made in it were granted . and from far away people streamed to it to burn incense in his honor .
