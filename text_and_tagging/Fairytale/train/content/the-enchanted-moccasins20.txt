this is the wigwam , said ko - ko , and this is the old woman . " what are you looking for ? " asked the old woman . " i want to find the lodge with the wicked young women in it , who slay travellers and steal their trappings , " answered ko - ko . " you mean the two young women who lived in the flying lodge ? " said the old woman . " the same , " answered ko - ko . " i am going to kill them . " with this he gave a great flourish with his borrowed club , and looked desperate and murderous as he could . " they were slain yesterday by the wearer of the ball , " said the old woman . ko - ko looked around for the door in a very owlish way , and heaving a short hem from his chest , he acknowledged that he had heard something to that effect down in one of the villages . " but there 's the brother . i 'll have a chance at him , " said ko - ko . " he is dead too , " said the old woman . " is there nobody then left for me to kill ? " cried ko - ko . " must i then go back without any blood upon my hands ? " he made as if he could shed tears over his sad mishap . " the father is still living ; and you will find him in the lodge , if you have a mind to call on him . he would like to see the owl , " the old woman added . " he shall , " replied ko - ko . " have you any bones about the house ; for i suppose i shall have to climb that tree . " " oh , yes ; plenty , " answered the old woman . " you can have as many as you want . "
