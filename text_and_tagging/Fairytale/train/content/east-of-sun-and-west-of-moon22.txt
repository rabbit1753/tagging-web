the maiden now rode for many days and weeks , and it took a long , long time before she came to the east wind . but at last she did find him.then she asked the east wind whether he could show her the road that led to the prince who lived in the castle that was east of the sun and west of the moon . o , yes , he had heard tell of the prince , and of the castle as well , said the east wind . but he did not know the road that led to it , for he had never blown so far . " but if you wish , i will take you to my brother , the west wind , and perhaps he can tell you , for he is much stronger than i am . just sit down on my back , and i will carry you to him . "
