she was wholly occupied in this employment , without a thought of danger , when , all of a sudden , the king of the buffalos came dashing on with his herd of followers , and making sure of her by means of her drooping tresses , he placed her upon the back of one of his favorite buffalos , and away he cantered over the plains . plunging into a river that bounded his land , he bore her safely to his lodge on the other side . and now the buffalo - king having secured the beautiful person of aggo dah gauda 's daughter , he set to work to make her heart his own -- a little ceremony which it would have been , perhaps , wiser for his majesty , the king of the buffalos , to have attended to before , for he now worked to little purpose . although he labored with great zeal to gain her affections , she sat pensive and disconsolate in the lodge , among the other females , and scarcely ever spoke , nor did she take the least interest in the affairs of the king 's household . to the king himself she paid no heed , and although he breathed forth to her every soft and gentle word he could think of , she sat still and motionless for all the world like one of the lowly bushes by the door of her father 's lodge , when the summer wind has died away .
