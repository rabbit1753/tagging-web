after that he went his way walking , and had not gone far when he came to a spring . " i 'll have a drink before i go further , " thought he . with that he stooped down and took a drink of the water . when he had drunk he lay on the ground and fell asleep . now , there was n't a morning that the lady in the green knight 's castle did n't wash in the water of that spring , and she sent a maid for the water each time . whatever part of the day it was when lawn dyarrig fell asleep , he was sleeping in the morning when the girl came . she thought it was dead the man was , and she was so in dread of him that she would not come near the spring for a long time . at last she saw he was asleep , and then she took the water . her mistress was complaining of her for being so long . " do not blame me , " said the maid . " i am sure that if it was yourself that was in my place you 'd not come back so soon . " " how so ? " asked the lady . " the finest hero that ever a woman laid eyes on is sleeping at the spring . " " that 's a thing that can not be till lawn dyarrig comes to the age of a hero . when that time comes he 'll be sleeping at the spring . " " he is in it now , " said the girl .
