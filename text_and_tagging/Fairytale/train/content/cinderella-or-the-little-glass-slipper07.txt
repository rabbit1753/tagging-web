cinderella brought the trap to her , and in it there were three huge rats . the fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard , and , having touched him with her wand , he was turned into a fat , jolly coachman , who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld . after that , she said to her : " go again into the garden , and you will find six lizards behind the watering - pot , bring them to me . " she had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen , who skipped up immediately behind the coach , with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver , and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives . the fairy then said to cinderella : " well , you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with ; are you not pleased with it ? " " oh ! yes , " cried she ; " but must i go there as i am , in these nasty rags ? " her godmother only just touched her with her wand , and , at the same instant , her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver , all beset with jewels . this done , she gave her a pair of glass slippers , the prettiest in the whole world . being thus decked out , she got up into her coach ; but her godmother , above all things , commanded her not to stay till after midnight , telling her , at the same time , that if she stayed one moment longer , the coach would be a pumpkin again , her horses mice , her coachman a rat , her footmen lizards , and her clothes become just as they were before .
