the man was very frightened at her words , and lay absolutely still while the undertaker came and measured him for his coffin ; and his wife gave orders to the gravedigger about his grave . that evening the coffin was sent home , and in the morning at nine o'clock the woman put him on a long flannel garment , and called to the undertaker 's men to fasten down the lid and carry him to the grave , where all their friends were waiting them . just as the body was being placed in the ground the other woman 's husband came running up , dressed , as far as anyone could see , in no clothes at all . everybody burst into shouts of laughter at the sight of him , and the men laid down the coffin and laughed too , till their sides nearly split . the dead man was so astonished at this behaviour , that he peeped out of a little window in the side of the coffin , and cried out : ' i should laugh as loudly as any of you , if i were not a dead man .
