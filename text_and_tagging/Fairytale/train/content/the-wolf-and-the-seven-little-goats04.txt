the wolf then ran to a baker . " baker , " said he , " i am hurt in the foot ; pray spread some dough over the place . " and when the baker had plastered his feet , he ran to the miller . " miller , " said he , " strew me some white meal over my paws . " but the miller refused , thinking the wolf must be meaning harm to some one . " if you do n't do it , " cried the wolf , " i 'll eat you up ! " and the miller was afraid and did as he was told . and that just shows what men are .
