the hours slid by , and all was still , so still that manawyddan well - nigh dropped asleep . but at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the world , and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice , which could neither be numbered nor measured . each mouse climbed up a straw till it bent down with its weight . then it bit off one of the ears , and carried it away . there was not one of the straws that had not got a mouse to it . full of wrath he rushed at the mice . he could no more come up with them than if they had been gnats , or birds of the air , save one only which lingered behind the rest , and this mouse manawyddan came up with . stooping down he seized it by the tail , and put it in his glove , and tied a piece of string across the opening of the glove , so that the mouse could not escape . when he entered the hall where kieva was sitting , he lighted a fire , and hung the glove up on a peg .
