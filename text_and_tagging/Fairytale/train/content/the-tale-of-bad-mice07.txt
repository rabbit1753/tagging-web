so that is the story of the two bad mice . but they were not so very , very naughty after all , because tom thumb paid for everything he broke . he found a crooked sixpence under the hearth - rug ; and upon christmas eve he and hunca munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of lucinda and jane . and very early every morning -- before anybody is awake -- hunca munca comes with her dust - pan and her broom to sweep the dollies ' house !
