momotaro now hurried on his way till it was midday . he began to feel hungry , so he opened his bag and took out one of the rice - cakes and sat down under a tree by the side of the road to eat it . while he was thus having his lunch a dog almost as large as a colt came running out from the high grass . he made straight for momotaro , and showing his teeth , said in a fierce way : " you are a rude man to pass my field without asking permission first . if you leave me all the cakes you have in your bag you may go ; otherwise i will bite you till i kill you !
