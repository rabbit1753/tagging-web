now all the princesses met at the castle , and were happy as they never had been before , in all their lives , and they fell in love with halvor and he with them , and he was to choose the one whom he loved best ; but it was the youngest who loved him the most of all . yet halvor acted strangely , and grew quite silent and uncommunicative ; so the princess asked him what he was longing for , and whether he did not enjoy being with them . yes , he enjoyed it very much , for they had enough to live on , and he was well enough off , but yet he was homesick , for his parents were still living , and he would like to see them again . that could easily be arranged , said the princess . " you shall go and return without harm , if you will follow our advice . " indeed , and he would surely do nothing against their wishes , said halvor . then they dressed him up until he looked as handsome as a king 's son , and put a ring on his finger that made it possible for the one wearing it to wish himself away , and back again . but he must not throw the ring away , and he must not mention their names , said the princesses , otherwise its power would be gone , all their joy would come to an end , and he would never see them again . at that moment halvor stepped in , and then the girls were so embarrassed that they ran out of the house without their caps . and when they came in again , they were so ashamed that they did not venture to look at halvor , whom they had always treated with such scorn and contempt . " well , you always acted as though you were so fine and handsome that no one on earth could compare with you . but you ought to see the oldest princess , whom i delivered , " said halvor . " compared to her you look like dairy - maids , and the middle princess is still handsomer ; while the youngest princess , who is my sweetheart , is more beautiful than the sun and moon . would to god she were here , so that you might see her ! " said halvor .
