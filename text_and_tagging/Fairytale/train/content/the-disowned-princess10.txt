" he is my beloved brother , " answered the king . " formerly he was the ruler of the tsian - tang river , but now he has been deposed . " liu i asked : " why should the matter be kept from him ? " " he is so wild and uncontrollable , " was the reply , " that i fear he would cause great damage . the deluge which covered the earth for nine long years in the time of the emperor yau was the work of his anger . because he fell out with one of the kings of heaven , he caused a great deluge that rose and covered the tops of five high mountains . then the king of heaven grew angry with him , and gave him to me to guard . i had to chain him to a column in my palace .
