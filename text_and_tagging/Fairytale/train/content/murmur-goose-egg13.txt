when murmur goose - egg had nearly finished threshing , the enemy broke into the land , and war began . then the king told him to gather people about him , and go to meet the foe , and do battle with him , for he thought the enemy would probably kill him . no , said murmur goose - egg , he did not want to have the king 's people killed . he would see that he dealt with the enemy himself . all the better , thought the king , then i am sure to get rid of him . but he would need a proper club , said murmur .
