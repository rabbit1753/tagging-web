that was the first day , and as time went on it got worse and worse . the wretched duckling was chased about by everybody , and even his mother and sisters were nasty to him , and kept saying : " i wish the cat would get you , you ugly devil . " and his mother said : " i wish you 'd get right away " ; and the ducks bit him and the hens pecked him , and the maid who had to feed the creatures kicked at him . so he ran away , and flew over the fence . the little birds in the bushes shot up in the air in a fright . " that 's because i 'm so ugly , " the duckling thought , and shut his eyes , but ran on all the same , till he got out into the wide marsh where the wild - duck lived ; and there he lay all night , for he was very tired and very unhappy .
