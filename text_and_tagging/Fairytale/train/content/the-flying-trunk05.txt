she was lying on the sofa asleep , and was so beautiful that the young merchant had to kiss her . then she woke up and was very much frightened , but he said he was a turkish god who had come through the air to see her , and that pleased her very much . they sat close to each other , and he told her a story about her eyes . they were beautiful dark lakes in which her thoughts swam about like mermaids . and her forehead was a snowy mountain , grand and shining . these were lovely stories . then he asked the princess to marry him , and she said yes at once . ' but you must come here on saturday , ' she said , ' for then the sultan and the sultana are coming to tea with me . they will be indeed proud that i receive the god of the turks . but mind you have a really good story ready , for my parents like them immensely . my mother likes something rather moral and high - flown , and my father likes something merry to make him laugh .
