while the monkey and the hare wrestled , the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and were in danger of falling over . " red - back ! red - back ! stand your ground ! " called out the deer . " long - ears ! long - ears ! be strong , be strong - don't let the monkey beat you ! " grunted the bear . so the monkey and the hare , encouraged by their friends , tried their very hardest to beat each other . the hare at last gained on the monkey . the monkey seemed to trip up , and the hare giving him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound .
