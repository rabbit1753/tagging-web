toward morning the princess wanted to fly home again , but she did not venture to ride alone ; the troll must accompany her . he was quite ready to do so , took his goat from the stable -- he had one just like that of the princess -- and anointed him between the horns . when the troll had mounted , the comrade swung up in back of him , and off they were through the air in the direction of the king 's castle . but on the way the comrade beat away lustily at the troll and his goat , and gave him thump after thump , and blow after blow with his sword , until they were flying lower and lower , and at last nearly fell into the sea across which their journey led them . when the troll noticed how stormy the weather was , he accompanied the princess to the castle , and waited outside to make sure that she really came home safely . but the moment when the door closed on the princess , the comrade hewed off his head , and went up with it to the youth 's room .
