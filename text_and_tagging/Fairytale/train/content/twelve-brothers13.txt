but he left her no peace , till she went and unlocked the room and showed him the twelve coffins filled with shavings , and with the little pillow laid in each . then she said : ' my dearest benjamin , your father has had these coffins made for you and your eleven brothers , because if i bring a girl into the world you are all to be killed and buried in them . ' she wept bitterly as she spoke , but her son comforted her and said : ' do n't cry , dear mother ; we 'll manage to escape somehow , and will fly for our lives . ' ' yes , ' replied his mother , ' that is what you must do - go with your eleven brothers out into the wood , and let one of you always sit on the highest tree you can find , keeping watch on the tower of the castle . if i give birth to a little son i will wave a white flag , and then you may safely return ; but if i give birth to a little daughter i will wave a red flag , which will warn you to fly away as quickly as you can , and may the kind heaven have pity on you . every night i will get up and pray for you , in winter that you may always have a fire to warm yourselves by , and in summer that you may not languish in the heat .
