so he came up on deck , out of the cabin , and took a look at the weather . then he called the ship 's carpenter and several others , and told them to go down at once into the ship 's hold , and bore two holes in the ship 's bottom . then they were to take the pumps from out their frames , and set them closely over the holes , so that the water would rise quite high in the pipes . the men were surprised , and thought his orders passing strange , yet they did as he told them . they bored the holes , and set up the pumps closely over them , so that not even a drop of water could get at the cargo ; yet the north sea stood seven feet high in the pumps . no more had they cast overboard their chips and litter than sir urian came along in a squall , and grabbed the master mariner by the collar . " wait , old boy , the matter is not so terribly urgent ! " said he , and began to defend himself , and pry loose the claws that held him with an awl . " did you not bind yourself in your contract always to keep my ship tight and dry ? " said the master mariner . " you are a nice article ! just take a look at the pumps ! the water stands seven feet high in the pipes ! pump , devil , pump my ship dry , then you may take me to have and to hold as long as ever you wish ! " the devil was fool enough , and allowed himself to be hoaxed . he worked and sweat , and the perspiration ran down his cheeks in such streams that one might have run a mill with them , but he merely kept on pumping out of the north sea into the north sea . at last he had enough of it , and when he could pump no longer , he flew home to his grandmother to rest . he let the master mariner stay master mariner as long as he might choose , and if he has not died he is still sailing the seas at his own sweet will , and letting the wind blow according to how he turns his cap .
