" " ah ! " said the king , " you did not do that , it was an angel from heaven ; for you were sitting in the swamp . " then sheep - peter drew out the king 's handkerchief , and then the king recognized him . then the herdsman said : " i also delivered the princesses ! " but the king would not believe that , and laughed at him . and then the youngest princess came along and told how it all had happened .
