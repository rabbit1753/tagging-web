" that will not worry the troll , " said the princess . " he will seize you without any questions asked . yet , if you positively will not go , why , try and see whether you can swing the sword that the troll uses in war . " he could not swing it ; but then the princess told him to take a swallow from the bottle that hung beside it , and when he had done so he could swing the sword . suddenly the troll came , and he was so large and so fat that he had to move sideways in order to get through the door . when he had thrust in his first head , he cried : " huhu ! i smell the blood of a christian ! " and that very moment halvor hewed off his first head , and then all the rest . the princess was pleased beyond measure ; but then she happened to think of her sisters , and she wished that they also might be delivered . halvor thought this might be done , and wanted to start out at once . but first he had to help the princess get the dead troll out of the way and then , the following morning , he set out .
