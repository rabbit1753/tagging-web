momotaro now got a small ship , and they all got on board . the wind and weather were fair , and the ship went like an arrow over the sea . it was the first time they had ever been on the water , and so at first the dog , the monkey and the pheasant were frightened at the waves and the rolling of the vessel , but by degrees they grew accustomed to the water and were quite happy again . every day they paced the deck of their little ship , eagerly looking out for the demons ' island .
