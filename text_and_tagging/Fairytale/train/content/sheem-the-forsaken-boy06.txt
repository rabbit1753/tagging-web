now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old manito , mishosha by name , who looked at the brothers as they played . he was vastly pleased with their nimbleness and beauty . he thought to himself , what shall i do to get these lads to accompany me ? one of them shall hit the ball sideways , and it shall fall into my canoe . it so happened , and it somehow seemed as if owasso , the elder brother , had purposely given it that direction . when owasso saw the old man , he professed to be greatly surprised . as was the other , sheem by name , in truth , for he had not noticed the old manito before . " bring the ball to us , " they both cried out . " come to the shore . " " no , " answered the old magician . he , however , came near enough for either of them to wade out to him . " come , come , " he said . " come and get your ball . " they insisted that he should come ashore , but he sturdily declined to oblige them .
