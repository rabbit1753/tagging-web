now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to eat ; and , as for seasons , he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever he wanted it , and saw that he got it ; so to him moti 's guess was like a miracle , and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence , for it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box . of course when the king marvelled and praised moti 's wisdom , everybody else did so too ; and , whilst the afghans went off crestfallen , moti took the horse and entered the king 's service . very soon after this , moti , who continued to live in the serai , came back one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had strayed . nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord , and no one knew what had become of him . after inquiring of everyone who was likely to know , moti seized the cord and his big staff and sallied out to look for him . away and away he tramped out of the city and into the neighbouring forest , tracking hoof - marks in the mud . presently it grew late , but still moti wandered on until suddenly in the gathering darkness he came right upon a tiger who was contentedly eating his horse .
