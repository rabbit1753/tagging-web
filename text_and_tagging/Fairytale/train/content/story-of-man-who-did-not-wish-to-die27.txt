all this sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders . he found himself , according to his ideas , in the land of topsyturvydom . everything was upside down . he had wished to escape from dying . he had come to the land of perpetual life with great relief and joy , only to find that the inhabitants themselves , doomed never to die , would consider it bliss to find death . what he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food . all the things to which he had been accustomed as food they rejected . whenever any merchants from other countries arrived , the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons . these they swallowed eagerly , hoping for death to come so that they might go to paradise .
