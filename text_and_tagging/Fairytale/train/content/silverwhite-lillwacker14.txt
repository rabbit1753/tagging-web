suddenly the sea - troll rose from the deeps , setting the waves whirling and foaming far and near . when the troll saw silverwhite , he grew angry and said : " why do you sit there beside my princess ? " the youth replied : " it seems to me that she is my princess , not yours . " the sea - troll answered : " time enough to see which of us is right ; but first our dogs shall fight . " silverwhite was nothing loath , and set his dogs at the dogs of the troll . there was a fierce struggle . but at last the youth 's dogs got the upper hand and bit the dogs of the sea - troll to death . then silverwhite drew his sword with a great sweep , rushed upon the sea - troll , and gave him such a tremendous blow that the monster 's head rolled on the sand . the troll gave a fearsome cry , and flung himself back into the sea , so that the water spurted to the very skies . thereupon the youth drew out his silver - mounted knife , cut out the troll 's eyes and put them in his pocket . then he saluted the lovely princess and went away .
