" you have come just in the nick of time , " said he , " for to - morrow i am to marry the princess . i do not want the monster with the nose at all , and you are the only person who can save me . i will say that first i wish to see whether my bride is a capable housewife , and demand that she wash the three drops of tallow from my shirt . she will naturally agree to this , for she does not know that you made the spots , for only christian hands can wash them out again , but not the hands of this pack of trolls . then i will say i will marry none other than the maiden who can wash out the spots , and ask you to do so , " said the prince . and then both rejoiced and were happy beyond measure .
