liu i had waited for the king a long time . to all his questions the warrior replied : " our master is pleased at this moment to talk with the priest of the sun up on the coral - tower about the sacred book of the fire . he will , no doubt , soon be through . " liu i went on to ask : " why is he interested in the sacred book of the fire ? " the reply was : " our master is a dragon . the dragons are powerful through the power of water . they can cover hill and dale with a single wave . the priest is a human being . human beings are powerful through fire . they can burn the greatest palaces by means of a torch . fire and water fight each other , being different in their nature . for that reason our master is now talking with the priest , in order to find a way in which fire and water may complete each other . " before they had quite finished there appeared a man in a purple robe , bearing a scepter of jade in his hand .
