but she thought a great deal about ribby 's pie , and she read ribby 's letter over and over again . " i am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse ! " said duchess to herself--"i really could n't , could n't eat mouse pie . and i shall have to eat it , because it is a party . and my pie was going to be veal and ham . a pink and white pie - dish ! and so is mine ; just like ribby 's dishes ; they were both bought at tabitha twitchit 's . " duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it . " it is all ready to put into the oven . such lovely pie - crust ; and i put in a little tin patty - pan to hold up the crust ; and i made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam -- oh i do wish i could eat my own pie , instead of a pie made of mouse !
