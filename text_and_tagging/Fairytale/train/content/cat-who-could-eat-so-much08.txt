" good - day , cat ! have you had anything to eat yet to - day ? " said the bear . " o , only a little . my fast has hardly been broken , " said the cat . " i have had no more than a dish of mush and a little pot of fat and the man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell - cow at the manger and the leaf - sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the stone - pile and the squirrel in the hazel - bush and the fox , the sly - boots , and the hopping hare and the wild wolf , and i 'm thinking over whether i ought not to eat you up as well , " said she , and seized the little bear and ate him up .
