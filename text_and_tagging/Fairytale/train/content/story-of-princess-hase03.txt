when the little girl was five years old her mother fell dangerously ill and all the doctors and their medicines could not save her . a little before she breathed her last she called her daughter to her , and gently stroking her head , said : " hase - hime , do you know that your mother can not live any longer ? though i die , you must grow up a good girl . do your best not to give trouble to your nurse or any other of your family . perhaps your father will marry again and some one will fill my place as your mother . if so do not grieve for me , but look upon your father 's second wife as your true mother , and be obedient and filial to both her and your father . remember when you are grown up to be submissive to those who are your superiors , and to be kind to all those who are under you . do n't forget this . i die with the hope that you will grow up a model woman . "
