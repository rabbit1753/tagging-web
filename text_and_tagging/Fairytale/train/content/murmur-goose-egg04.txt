" i have not had a single full meal since the changling crawled out , " said one of them . when murmur goose - egg heard that , and the rest agreed , he said that he would gladly go his own gait , for " if they had no need of him , then he had no need of them , " and with that he went off . finally he came to a farmstead that lay in a rocky section , and asked for work . yes , they needed a workman , and the master told him to gather up the stones in the field . then murmur goose - egg gathered up the stones in the field . he picked up some that were so large that a number of horses could not have dragged them , and large and small , one and all , he put them in his pocket . before long he had finished his work , and wanted to know what he was to do next .
