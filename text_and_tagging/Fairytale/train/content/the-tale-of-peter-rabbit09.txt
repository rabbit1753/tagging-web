i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening . his mother put him to bed , and made some camomile tea ; and she gave a dose of it to peter ! " one table - spoonful to be taken at bed - time . " but flopsy , mopsy , and cotton - tail had bread and milk and blackberries , for supper .
