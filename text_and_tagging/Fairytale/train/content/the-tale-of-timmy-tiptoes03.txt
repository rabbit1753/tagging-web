they did collect quantities -- because they did not lose them ! squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half , because they can not remember the place . the most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called silvertail . he began to dig , and he could not remember . and then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him ; and there was a fight . and other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion ! unfortunately , just at this time a flock of little birds flew by , from bush to bush , searching for green caterpillars and spiders . there were several sorts of little birds , twittering different songs .
