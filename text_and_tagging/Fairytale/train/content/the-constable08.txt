he always came to visit at our house and he and my master would talk and drink together . one day my master said to him : " we administrative mandarins have a large salary and a good income besides . you are an officer , and have even reached the second step in rank , yet your salary is so small that you can not possibly make it do . have you any other income aside from it ? " the officer replied : " we are such good friends that i know i can speak openly to you . we officers are compelled to find some additional sources of revenue in order that our pockets may not be altogether empty . when we pay our men we make a small percentage of gains on the exchange ; and we also carry more soldiers on our rosters than there actually are present . if we had to live on our salaries we would die of hunger ! " when my husband heard him say this he could not rid himself of the idea that by disclosing these criminal proceedings the state would be indebted to him , and that it would surely aid his plans for advancement . on the other hand , he reflected that it would not be right to abuse his friend 's confidence . with these ideas in his mind he retired to his inner rooms . in the courtyard stood a round pavilion . lost in heavy thought , he crossed his hands behind his back , and for a long time walked round and round the pavilion . finally he said with a sigh : " charity begins at home ; i will sacrifice my friend ! " then he drew up his report , in which the officer was indicted .
