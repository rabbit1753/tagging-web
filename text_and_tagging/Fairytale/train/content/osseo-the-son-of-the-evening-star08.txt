" my son , " said the old man , " hang that cage of birds which you have brought along in your hand at the door , and i will inform you why you and your wife have been sent for . " osseo obeyed , and then took his seat in the lodge . " pity was shown to you , " resumed the king of the star , " on account of the contempt of your wife 's sister , who laughed at her ill fortune , and ridiculed you while you were under the power of that wicked spirit whom you overcame at the rock . that spirit lives in the next lodge , being the small star you see on the left of mine , and he has always felt envious of my family because we had greater power , and especially that we had committed to us the care of the female world . he failed in many attempts to destroy your brothers and sisters - in - law , but succeeded at last in transforming yourself and your wife into decrepid old persons . you must be careful and not let the light of his beams fall on you , while you are here , for therein lies the power of his enchantment . a ray of light is the bow and arrow he uses .
