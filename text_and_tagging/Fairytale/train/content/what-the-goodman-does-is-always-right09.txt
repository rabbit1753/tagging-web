the tail feathers of this fowl were very short , and it winked with both its eyes , and looked very cunning as it said , " cluck , cluck . " what were the thoughts of the fowl as it said this i can not tell you , but as soon as our good man saw it , he thought , " why , that 's the finest fowl i ever saw in my life ; it 's finer than our parson 's brood hen , upon my word . i should like to have that fowl . fowls can always pick up a few grains that lie about , and almost keep themselves . i think it would be a good exchange if i could get it for my goose . shall we exchange ? " he asked the toll keeper . " exchange ? " repeated the man . " well , it would not be a bad thing . "
