it was not long before the sisters , at their customary hour , came down and resumed their sport . " but see , " cried the younger sister , " that stump was not there before . " she ran off , frightened , toward the basket . her sisters only smiled , and gathering round the old tree - stump , they struck it , in jest , when out ran the mice , and among them waupee . they killed them all but one , which was pursued by the younger sister . just as she had raised a silver stick which she held in her hand to put an end to it , too , the form of the white hawk arose , and he clasped his prize in his arms . the other eleven sprang to their basket , and were drawn up to the skies . waupee exerted all his skill to please his bride and win her affections . he wiped the tears from her eyes . he related his adventures in the chase . he dwelt upon the charms of life on the earth . he was constant in his attentions , keeping fondly by her side , and picking out the way for her to walk as he led her gently toward his lodge . he felt his heart glow with joy as he entered it , and from that moment he was one of the happiest of men .
