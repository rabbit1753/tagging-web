owasso , being himself gifted with limited magical powers , spoke to the fish , and bade him swim toward the lodge , while he carried him along , which he did at great speed . once he directed the sturgeon to rise near the surface of the water , so that he might , if possible , get a view of the magician . the fish obeyed , and owasso saw the wicked old manito busy in another direction , fishing , as unconcerned as though he had not just lost a member of his family . on went the fish , and on went owasso , till they reached the shore , near the magician 's lodge , in advance of him . he then spoke kindly to the sturgeon , and told him he should not be angry with him for having speared him , as he was created to be meat for man . the sturgeon made no reply , or if he did , it has not been reported . owasso , drawing him on shore , went up and told his wife to dress and cook it immediately . by the time it was prepared the magician had come in sight . " your grandfather has arrived , " said the woman to her son . " go and see what he brings , and eat this as you go"--handing a piece of the fish . the boy went , and the magician no sooner saw him with the fish in his hand , than he asked him , " what are you eating ? and who brought it ?
