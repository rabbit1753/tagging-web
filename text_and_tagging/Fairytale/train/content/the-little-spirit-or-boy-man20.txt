although he provided for their support , the little spirit never performed household or hard work of any kind , and his sister obeyed . when she had made the weapons , which , though they were very small , were beautifully wrought and of the best stuff the field and wood could furnish , she again cautioned him not to shoot into the lake . " she thinks , " said the boy - man to himself , " i can see no further into the water than she . my sister shall learn better . " regardless of her warnings , he on purpose discharged a shaft into the lake . he waded out into the water till he got into its depth , and paddled about for his arrow , so as to call the attention of his sister , and as if to show that he hardily braved her advice . she hurried to the shore , calling on him to return . but instead of heeding her , he cried out : " you of the red fins , come and swallow me ! " although his sister did not clearly understand whom her brother was addressing , she too called out : " do n't mind the foolish boy ! " the boy - man 's order seemed to be best attended to , for immediately a monstrous fish came and swallowed him . before disappearing entirely , catching a glimpse of his sister standing in despair upon the shore , the boy - man hallooed out to her : " me - zush - ke - zin - ance ! " she wondered what he meant . at last it occurred to her that it must be an old moccasin . she accordingly ran to the lodge , and bringing one , she tied it to a string attached to a tree , and cast it into the water .
