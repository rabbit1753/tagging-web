' so they wept for joy , and kissed and hugged each other again and again . after a time benjamin said : ' dear sister , there is still a little difficulty , for we had all agreed that any girl we met should die at our hands , because it was for the sake of a girl that we had to leave our kingdom . ' ' but , ' she replied , ' i will gladly die if by that means i can restore my twelve brothers to their own . ' ' no , ' he answered , ' there is no need for that ; only go and hide under that tub till our eleven brothers come in , and i 'll soon make matters right with them . '
