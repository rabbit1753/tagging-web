when the ambassador rode into the courtyard of this house , and , holding out the shoe , asked if there were any fair ladies there who would like to try it on , the elder sister , who always thought a great deal of herself , ran forward , and said that she would do so , while the younger girl just shook her head and went on with her work . " for , " said she to herself , " though my feet are so little that they might go into the slipper , what would i do as the wife of a great prince ? folk would just laugh at me , and say that i was not fit for the position . no , no , i am far better to bide as i am . " so the ambassador gave the glass shoe to the elder sister , who carried it away to her own room ; and presently , to every one 's astonishment , came back wearing it on her foot . it is true that her face was very white , and that she walked with a little limp ; but no one noticed these things except her younger sister , and she only shook her wise little head , and said nothing .
