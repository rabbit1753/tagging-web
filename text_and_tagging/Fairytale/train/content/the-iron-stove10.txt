in the evening , when she had washed up and was ready , she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her . she cracked one and was going to eat the kernel , when behold ! there was a beautiful royal dress inside it ! when the bride heard of this , she came and begged for the dress , and wanted to buy it , saying that it was not a dress for a serving - maid . then she said she would not sell it unless she was granted one favour - namely , to sleep by the prince 's door . the bride granted her this , because the dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it . when it was evening she said to her bridegroom , ' that stupid maid wants to sleep by your door . ' ' if you are contented , i am , ' he said . but she gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping - draught . then they both went to his room , but he slept so soundly that she could not wake him . the maid wept all night long , and said , ' i freed you in the wild wood out of the iron stove ; i have sought you , and have crossed a glassy mountain , three sharp swords , and a great lake before i found you , and will you not hear me now ? ' the servants outside heard how she cried the whole night , and they told their master in the morning .
