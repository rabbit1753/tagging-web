one night , when she was lying in her pretty little bed , an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window . she was very ugly , clumsy , and clammy ; she hopped on to the table where thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose - leaf . ' this would make a beautiful wife for my son,'said the toad , taking up the walnut - shell , with thumbelina inside , and hopping with it through the window into the garden . there flowed a great wide stream , with slippery and marshy banks ; here the toad lived with her son . ugh ! how ugly and clammy he was , just like his mother ! ' croak , croak , croak!'was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut - shell . the tiny thumbelina woke up very early in the morning , and when she saw where she was she began to cry bitterly ; for on every side of the great green leaf was water , and she could not get to the land . the old toad was down under the marsh , decorating her room with rushes and yellow marigold leaves , to make it very grand for her new daughter - in - law ; then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where thumbelina lay . she wanted to fetch the pretty cradle to put it into her room before thumbelina herself came there . the old toad bowed low in the water before her , and said : ' here is my son ; you shall marry him , and live in great magnificence down under the marsh .
