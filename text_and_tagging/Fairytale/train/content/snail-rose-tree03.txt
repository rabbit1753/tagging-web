the summer and the autumn passed ; the rose - tree bore roses and buds till the snow fell and the weather became raw and wet ; then it bent down its head , and the snail crept into the ground . a new year began ; the roses made their appearance , and the snail made his too . " you are an old rose - tree now , " said the snail . " you must make haste and die . you have given the world all that you had in you ; whether it was of much importance is a question that i have not had time to think about . but this much is clear and plain , that you have not done the least for your inner development , or you would have produced something else . have you anything to say in defence ? you will now soon be nothing but a stick . do you understand what i say ? " " you frighten me , " said the rose -- tree . " i have never thought of that . "
