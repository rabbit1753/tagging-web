the good old man said : " i am very sorry for that . it is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them . i would have given you as many as ever you wanted . now please give me the ashes of the mortar , as i wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog . " the neighbor consented at once , and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes . not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden . a wonderful thing happened !
