' dan , ' says the eagle , ' i 'm tired with this long fly ; i had no notion it was so far . ' ' and my lord , sir , ' says i , ' who in the world axed you to fly so far -- was it i ? did not i beg and pray and beseech you to stop half an hour ago ? ' ' there 's no use talking , dan , ' said he ; ' i 'm tired bad enough , so you must get off , and sit down on the moon until i rest myself . ' ' is it sit down on the moon ? ' said i ; ' is it upon that little round thing , then ? why , then , sure , i 'd fall off in a minute , and be kilt and spilt , and smashed all to bits ; you are a vile deceiver -- so you are . ' ' not at all , dan , ' says he ; ' you can catch fast hold of the reaping - hook that 's sticking out of the side of the moon , and it will keep you up . ' ' i wo n't , then , ' said i. ' maybe not , ' said he , quite quiet .
