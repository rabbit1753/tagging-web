' o fionn , ' asked the man of the door - post , ' do you feel surprised at the appearance and arrangements of this house ? ' i assured him that i never saw anything which surprised me more . ' well , then , i will explain the meaning of all these things to you , ' said the man . ' the giant carrying the grunting hog between the prongs of the iron fork , whom you first saw , is he who is yonder , and his name is sloth . she who is close to me is the young woman who had been forcing him along , that is energy ; and energy compels sloth forward with her ; for energy moves , in the twinkling of the eye , a greater distance than the foot can travel in a year . the old man of the bright eyes yonder signifies the world ; and he is more powerful than anyone , which has been proved by his rendering the ram powerless . that ram which you saw signifies the crimes of the man . that hag there beyond is withering old age , and her clothing has withered your four men . the two wells from which you drank the two draughts mean falsehood and truth ; for while telling a lie one finds it sweet , but it becomes bitter at the last . cuanna from innistuil is my own name . i do not reside here , but having conceived a wonderful love for you , o fionn , on account of your superiority in wisdom and general celebrity , i therefore put those things into the way before you in order that i might see you . and this story shall be called , to the end of the world , the hospitality of cuanna 's house to fionn . let you and your men come together , and do ye five sleep until morning . ' accordingly we did so , and when we awoke in the morning we found ourselves on the summit of cairn feargaill , with our hounds and arms by us . so there is the meaning of the byword , ' the hospitality of fionn in the house of cuanna , ' o conan , said fionn .
