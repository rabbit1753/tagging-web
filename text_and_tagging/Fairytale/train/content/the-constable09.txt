when my husband heard him say this he could not rid himself of the idea that by disclosing these criminal proceedings the state would be indebted to him , and that it would surely aid his plans for advancement . on the other hand , he reflected that it would not be right to abuse his friend 's confidence . with these ideas in his mind he retired to his inner rooms . in the courtyard stood a round pavilion . lost in heavy thought , he crossed his hands behind his back , and for a long time walked round and round the pavilion . finally he said with a sigh : " charity begins at home ; i will sacrifice my friend ! " then he drew up his report , in which the officer was indicted . an imperial order was issued , the matter was investigated , and the officer was condemned to death . my husband , however , was at once increased in rank , and from that time on advanced rapidly . and with the exception of myself no one ever knew anything of the matter . when my mother told them of her encounter with wang in the nether world , the whole family burst into loud weeping . four tents full of buddhist and taoist priests were sent for , who fasted and read masses for thirty - five days in order that wang might be delivered . whole mountains of paper money , silk and straw figures were burned , and the ceremonies have not as yet come to an end .
