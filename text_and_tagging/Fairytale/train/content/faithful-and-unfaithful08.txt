he straightway ordered faithful to be brought before him , and threatened him with death if he did not at once hurry into the hill and bring back the wife of whom he had been robbed . if he were successful great honor should be his reward . in vain faithful denied what unfaithful had said of him , the king stuck to his demand , and the youth withdrew , convinced that he had not long to live . then he went to the stable to bid farewell to his beautiful horse , and stood beside him and wept . " what grieves you so ? " asked the horse . then the youth told him of all that had happened , and said that this was probably the last time he would be able to visit him . " if it be no more than that , " said the horse , " there is a way to help you . up in the garret of the castle there is an old fiddle , take it with you and play it when you come to the place where the queen is kept . and fashion for yourself armor of steel wire , and set knives into it everywhere , and then , when you see the troll open his jaws , descend into his maw , and thus slay him . but you must have no fear , and must trust me to show you the way . " these words filled the youth with fresh courage , he went to the king and received permission to leave , secretly fashioned his steel armor , took the old fiddle from the garret of the castle , led his dear horse out of the stable , and without delay set forth for the troll 's hill .
