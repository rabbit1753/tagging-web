before the earth was separated from the heavens , all there was was a great ball of watery vapor called chaos . and at that time the spirits of the five elemental powers took shape , and became the five ancients . the first was called the yellow ancient , and he was the ruler of the earth . the second was called the red lord , and he was the ruler of the fire . the third was called the dark lord , and he was the ruler of the water . the fourth was known as the wood prince , and he was the ruler of the wood . the fifth was called the mother of metals , and ruled over them . these five ancients set all their primal spirit into motion , so that water and earth sank down . the heavens floated upward , and the earth grew firm in the depths .
