it was lucky that the horse was sure - footed and knew the road , for his bridle hung loose on his neck , and his master took no heed of the way he was going . when the farm - house was reached , the man led the animal to the stable , and then went to look for his son . ' i know everything -- you have deceived me . get out of my sight at once -- i have done with you , ' he stammered , choking with passion as he came up to the young man , who was cutting a stick in front of the door , whistling gaily the while . ' but , father-- ' ' you are no son of mine ; i have only one now . begone , or it will be the worse for you , ' and as he spoke he lifted up his whip . the young man shrank back . he feared lest his father should fall down in a fit , his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head . but it was no use staying : perhaps next morning the old man might listen to reason , though in his heart the son felt that he would never take back his words . so he turned slowly away , and walked heavily along a path which ended in a cave on the side of his hill , and there he sat through the night , thinking of what had happened .
