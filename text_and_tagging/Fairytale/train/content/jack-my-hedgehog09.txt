then jack my hedgehog rode on with his cock and bagpipes to the country of the second king to whom he had shown the way . now this king had given orders that , in the event of jack 's coming the guards were to present arms , the people to cheer , and he was to be conducted in triumph to the royal palace . when the king 's daughter saw jack my hedgehog , she was a good deal startled , for he certainly was very peculiar looking ; but after all she considered that she had given her word and it could n't be helped . so she made jack welcome and they were betrothed to each other , and at dinner he sat next her at the royal table , and they ate and drank together .
