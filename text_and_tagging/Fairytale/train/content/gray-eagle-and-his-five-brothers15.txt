" softly , peepi , " said the gray eagle , stepping in between them . " do n't be in such a huff , my little brother , nor exhibit so revengeful a temper . do you not know that we are to forgive our enemies ? white owl , you may go ; but let this be a lesson to you , not to play the tyrant over those who may chance to be weaker than yourself .
