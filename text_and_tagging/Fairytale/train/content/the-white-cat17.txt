before he had time to defend himself my unhappy lover was swallowed up by the dragon . as for me , the fairies , furious at having their plans defeated , for they intended me to marry the king of the dwarfs , and i utterly refused , changed me into a white cat . when they brought me here i found all the lords and ladies of my father 's court awaiting me under the same enchantment , while the people of lesser rank had been made invisible , all but their hands . as they laid me under the enchantment the fairies told me all my history , for until then i had quite believed that i was their child , and warned me that my only chance of regaining my natural form was to win the love of a prince who resembled in every way my unfortunate lover . " and you have won it , lovely princess , " interrupted the prince . " you are indeed wonderfully like him , " resumed the princess-"in voice , in features , and everything ; and if you really love me all my troubles will be at an end . " " and mine too , " cried the prince , throwing himself at her feet , " if you will consent to marry me . " " i love you already better than anyone in the world , " she said ; " but now it is time to go back to your father , and we shall hear what he says about it . "
