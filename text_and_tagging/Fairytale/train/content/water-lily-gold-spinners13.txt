the prince suddenly remembered the gold - spinners , and said to himself : " if i ride there , maybe they could explain this to me ? " he at once rode to the hut , and found the two maidens at the fountain . he told them what had befallen their sister the year before , and how he had twice heard a strange song , but yet could see no singer . they said that the yellow water - lily could be none other than their sister , who was not dead , but transformed by the magic ball . before he went to bed , the eldest made a cake of magic herbs , which she gave him to eat . in the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other . next morning he told this to the maidens , and they said that the charmed cake had caused it , and advised him to listen well to the birds , and see what they could tell him , and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage .
