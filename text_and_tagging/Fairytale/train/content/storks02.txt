" it must look very grand for my wife to have a sentinel to guard her nest , " he thought . " they ca n't know that i am her husband and will , of course , conclude that i am commanded to stand here by her nest . it looks aristocratic ! " below , in the street , a crowd of children were playing . when they chanced to catch sight of the storks , one of the boldest of the boys began to sing the old song about the stork . the others soon joined him , but each sang the words that he happened to have heard . this is one of the ways : " stork , stork , fly away ; stand not on one leg to - day . thy dear wife sits in the nest , to lull the little ones to rest . " there 's a halter for one , there 's a stake for another , for the third there 's a gun , and a spit for his brother ! "
