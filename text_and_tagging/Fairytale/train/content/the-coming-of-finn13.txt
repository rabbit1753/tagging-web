finn , bearing the head , passed through the sleepers into the palace and spiked the head on his own spear , and drove the spear - end into the ground at conn 's end of the great hall . then the sickness and faintness of death came upon finn , also a great horror and despair overshadowed him , so that he was about to give himself up for utterly lost . yet he recalled one of his marvellous attributes , and approaching a silver vessel , into which pure water ever flowed and which was always full , he made a cup with his two hands and , lifting it to his mouth , drank , and the blood began to circulate in his veins , and strength returned to his limbs , and the cheerful hue of rosy health to his cheeks . having rested himself sufficiently he went forth and shouted to the sleeping host , and called the captains by their names , beginning with conn . they awoke and rose up , though dazed and stupid , for it was difficult for any man , no matter how he had stopped his ears , to avoid hearing finn when he sent forth his voice of power .
