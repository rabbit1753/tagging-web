" i must thank you for coming to visit me : i have been expecting you for a long time . i am sure you have come to win me , and i can well imagine that you are in a great hurry . but you must have a little patience . i am to receive a large dower , and am not yet ready for the wedding . i will do my best to see that we are married soon . " when she had said this , she produced a couple of egg - shells , with all sorts of eatables such as rats eat . she set them down before the youth , and said : " now you must sit down and help yourself , for i am sure you are tired and hungry .
