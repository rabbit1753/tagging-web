now it happened one day that a king who was hunting in the wood had a large greyhound , who ran sniffing to the tree on which the girl sat , and jumped round it , yelping and barking furiously . the king 's attention was attracted , and when he looked up and beheld the beautiful princess with the golden star on her forehead , he was so enchanted by her beauty that he asked her on the spot to be his wife . she gave no answer , but nodded slightly with her head . then he climbed up the tree himself , lifted her down , put her on his horse and bore her home to his palace . the marriage was celebrated with much pomp and ceremony , but the bride neither spoke nor laughed .
