once on a time , a mouse and a bird and a sausage lived and kept house together in perfect peace among themselves , and in great prosperity . it was the bird 's business to fly to the forest every day and bring back wood . the mouse had to draw the water , make the fire , and set the table ; and the sausage had to do the cooking . nobody is content in this world : much will have more ! one day the bird met another bird on the way , and told him of his excellent condition in life . but the other bird called him a poor simpleton to do so much work , while the two others led easy lives at home .
