his parents and friends raised their voices in loud lamentation ; they clung to him , and as a special favor , which he could now grant , being himself a spirit , he allowed them to accompany him to the sand - banks . they all seated themselves to watch his last farewell . the day was mild ; the sky clear , not a cloud appearing to dim the heavens , nor a breath of wind to ruffle the tranquil waters . a perfect silence fell upon the company . they gazed with eager eyes fastened on wassamo , as he waded out into the water , waving his hands . they saw him descend , more and more , into the depths . they beheld the waves close over his head , and a loud and piercing wail went up which rent the sky . they looked again ; a red flame , as if the sun had glanced on a billow , lighted the spot for an instant ; but the feather of flames , wassamo of the fire - plume , had disappeared from home and kindred , and the familiar paths of his youth , forever .
