the young man obeyed : at each bound the little hare went seven miles , and it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large and beautiful as a castle could be . ' the golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by , ' said the little hare , ' and you will easily find it . it lives in a little cage , with another cage beside it made all of gold . but whatever you do , be sure not to put it in the beautiful cage , or everybody in the castle will know that you have stolen it . ' the youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch , but as stiff and rigid as if he was dead . and beside the beautiful cage was the cage of gold . ' perhaps he would revive if i were to put him in that lovely cage , ' thought the youth .
