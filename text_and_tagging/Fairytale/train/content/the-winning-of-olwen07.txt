' is there a porter ? ' cried kilweh , looking round for someone to open the gate . ' there is ; and i am arthur 's porter every first day of january , ' answered a man coming out to him . ' the rest of the year there are other porters , and among them pennpingyon , who goes upon his head to save his feet . ' ' well , open the portal , i say . ' ' no , that i may not do , for none can enter save the son of a king or a pedlar who has goods to sell . but elsewhere there will be food for thy dogs and hay for thy horse , and for thee collops cooked and peppered , and sweet wine shall be served in the guest chamber . ' ' that will not do for me , ' answered kilweh . ' if thou wilt not open the gate i will send up three shouts that shall be heard from cornwall unto the north , and yet again to ireland . ' ' whatever clamour you may make , ' spake glewlwyd the porter , ' you shall not enter until i first go and speak with arthur . '
