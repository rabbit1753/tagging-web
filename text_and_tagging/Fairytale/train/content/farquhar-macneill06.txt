and as he danced a strange change came over him . he forgot his errand , he forgot his home , and he forgot everything that had ever happened to him . he only knew that he wanted to remain with the fairies all the rest of his life . and he did remain with them . a magic spell had been cast over him , and he became like one of themselves . he could come and go at nights without being seen . he could sip the dew from the grass and honey from the flowers as daintily and noiselessly as if he had been a fairy born . time passed by , and one night he and a band of merry companions set out for a long journey through the air . they started early . they intended to pay a visit to the man in the moon and be back again before cock - crow .
