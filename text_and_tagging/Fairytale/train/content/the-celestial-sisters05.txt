the next day , selecting the same hour , the white hawk went back to the prairie , and took his station near the ring . in order to deceive the sisters , he assumed the form of an opossum , and sat among the grass as if he were there engaged in chewing the cud . he had not waited long when he saw the cloudy basket descend , and heard the same sweet music falling as before . he crept slowly toward the ring . but the instant the sisters caught sight of him they were startled , and sprang into their car . it rose a short distance when one of the elder sisters spoke : " perhaps , " she said , " it is come to show us how the game is played by mortals . " " oh no , " the youngest replied ; " quick , let us ascend . " and all joining in a chant , they rose out of sight . waupee , casting off his disguise , walked sorrowfully back to his lodge - but ah , the night seemed very long to lonely white hawk ! his whole soul was filled with the thought of the beautiful sister .
