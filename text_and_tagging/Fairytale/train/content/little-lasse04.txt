ah ! how sorry little lasse was now that he had been disobedient and got into the boat , when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do so ! now it was too late , he could not get back to land . perhaps he would be lost out on the great sea . what should he do ? when he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him , he put his two little hands together and said , ' good god , do not be angry with little lasse . ' and then he went to sleep . for although it was daylight , old nukku matti was sitting on the shores of the ' land of nod , ' and was fishing for little children with his long fishing rod . he heard the low words which little lasse said to god , and he immediately drew the boat to himself and laid little lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves . then nukku matti said to one of the dreams , ' play with little lasse , so that he does not feel lonesome . ' it was a little dream - boy , so little , so little , that he was less than lasse himself ; he had blue eyes and fair hair , a red cap with a silver band , and white coat with pearls on the collar . he came to little lasse and said , ' would you like to sail round the world ? ' ' yes , ' said lasse in his sleep , ' i should like to . ' ' come , then , ' said the dream - boy , ' and let us sail in your pea - shell boats . you shall sail in hercules and i shall sail in the flea . '
