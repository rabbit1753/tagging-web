the king 's daughter was now filled with eagerness , no longer listened to her step - sister 's calls , and kept right on running . yet each time when she stooped to pick the lily , it suddenly disappeared and reappeared somewhat further away . thus it went for some time , and the princess was drawn further and further into the deep forest . but the lily continued to stand , and disappear and move further away , and each time the flower seemed larger and more beautiful than before . at length the princess came to a high hill , and as she looked toward its summit , there stood the lily high on the naked rock , glittering as white and radiant as the brightest star . the king 's daughter now began to climb the hill , and in her eagerness she paid no attention to stones nor steepness . and when at last she reached the summit of the hill , lo and behold ! the lily no longer evaded her grasp ; but remained where it was , and the princess stooped and picked it and hid it in her bosom , and so heartfelt was her happiness that she forgot her step - sisters and everything else in the world .
