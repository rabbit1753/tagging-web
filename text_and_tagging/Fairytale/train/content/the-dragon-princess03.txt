the wise man said : " there are four paths in this cave . one path leads to the south - west shore of the sea of dungting , the second path leads to a valley in the land of the four rivers , the third path ends in a cave on the mountain of lo - fu and the fourth in an island of the eastern sea . in this cave dwells the seventh daughter of the dragon - king of the eastern sea , who guards his pearls and his treasure . it happened once in the ancient days , that a fisherboy dived into the water and brought up a pearl from beneath the chin of a black dragon .
