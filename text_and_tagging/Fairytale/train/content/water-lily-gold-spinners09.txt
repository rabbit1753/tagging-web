by great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard 's son in the palace garden , who understood the speech of birds , and to him he had entrusted the message . when the prince heard it , he was very sorrowful , and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden . then he said to the wind wizard 's son : " beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night , for then will i come and fetch her away . " the wind wizard 's son did this , and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening . the maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home , telling no one what she had heard .
