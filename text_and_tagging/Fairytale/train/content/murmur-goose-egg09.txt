then murmur goose - egg went into the smithy , and had the smith make an iron ax of five hundred - weights . with that he went into the forest and began to chop . he chopped down big pine and fir trees , as thick as masts , and all that he found on the king 's ground , as well as what he found on that of his neighbors . but he cut off neither the branches nor the tree - tops , so that all lay there as though felled by the storm . then he loaded a sizable stack on the sled , and put to the horses . but they could not move the load from the spot . so he unharnessed them , and put himself to the sled , and went off alone with the load . when he came to the king 's castle , there stood the king with the master carpenter in the entrance , and they were ready to give him a warm reception , because of the destruction he had wrought in the forest . for the master carpenter had been there and seen the havoc he had made . but when murmur goose - egg came along with half the forest , the king grew frightened as well as angry , and he thought that if murmur was so strong , it would be best to handle him with care .
