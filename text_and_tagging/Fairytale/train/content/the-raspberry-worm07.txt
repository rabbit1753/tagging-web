so aina and lisa went off to the wood . ah ! how delightful it was there , how beautiful ! it was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the fallen trees , and getting caught in the branches , and waging war with the juniper bushes and the midges , but what did that matter ? the girls climbed well in their short dresses , and soon they were deep in the wood . there were plenty of bilberries and elder berries , but no raspberries . they wandered on and on , and at last they came ... no , it could not be true ! ... they came to a large raspberry wood . the wood had been on fire once , and now raspberry bushes had grown up , and there were raspberry bushes and raspberry bushes as far as the eye could see . every bush was weighted to the ground with the largest , dark red , ripe raspberries , such a wealth of berries as two little berry pickers had never found before !
