for a long time all went well . whenever guests came , his wife laid the table for the old folk in the bake - house , and on each occasion so much money was left lying there , that before long they did not know what to do with it all . but ugly she was , and ugly she remained , and he was heartily weary of her . so it was bound to happen that he sometimes flew into a rage , and threatened her with cuffs and blows . once he wanted to go to town , and since it was fall , and the ground already frozen , the horse had first to be shod . so he went into the smithy -- for he himself was a notable farrier -- but , no matter what lie did , the horse - shoe was either too large or too small , and would not fit at all . he had no other horse at home , and he toiled away until noon and on into the afternoon . " will you never make an end of your shoeing ? " asked his wife . " you are not a very good husband ; but you are a far worse farrier . i see there is nothing left for me but to go into the smithy myself and shoe the horse . this shoe is too large , you should have made it smaller , and that one is too small , you should have made it larger .
