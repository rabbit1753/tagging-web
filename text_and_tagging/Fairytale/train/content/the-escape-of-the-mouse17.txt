' it is a marvel , truly , ' said she , ' yet it would be unseemly for a man of thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this . do not meddle with it , but let it go . ' ' woe betide me , ' he cried , ' if i would not hang them all if i could catch them , and such as i have i will hang . ' ' verily , ' said she , ' there is no reason i should succour this reptile , except to prevent discredit unto thee . ' ' if i knew any cause that i should succour it , i would take thy counsel , ' answered manawyddan , ' but i know of none . i am minded to destroy it . ' ' do so then , ' said kieva .
