when the mother heard that she thought it might not be such a bad idea after all . she dressed up the youth as well as she could , so that he would make a good showing when he came to the mother in the corner , and then he set forth . when he stepped out the sun was shining bright and warm . it had rained during the night , and the ground was soft and full of water puddles . the youth took the shortest path to the mother in the corner , and sang and danced , as he always did . but suddenly , as he was hopping and skipping along , he came to a swamp , and there were only some logs laid down to cross it . from the one log he had to jump over a puddle to a clump of grass , unless he wanted to dirty his shoes . and then he went kerflop ! the very moment he set foot on the clump of grass , he went down and down until he was standing in a dark , ugly hole . at first he could see nothing at all , but when he had been there a little while , he saw that there was a rat , who was wiggling and waggling around , and had a bunch of keys hanging from her tail .
