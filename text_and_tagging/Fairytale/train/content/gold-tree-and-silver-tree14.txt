so things went peacefully on for a year . queen silver - tree was satisfied and contented , because she thought that her step - daughter was dead . while all the time the princess was happy and prosperous in her new home . but at the end of the year it chanced that the queen went once more to the well in the little glen , in order to see her face reflected in the water . and it chanced also that the same little trout was swimming backwards and forwards , just as he had done the year before . and the foolish queen determined to have a better answer to her question this time than she had last . " troutie , troutie , " she whispered , leaning over the edge of the well , " am not i the most beautiful woman in the world ? " " by my truth , you are not , " answered the trout , in his very straightforward way . " who is the most beautiful woman , then ?

" why , your majesty 's step - daughter , the princess gold - tree , to be sure , " answered the trout . the queen threw back her head with a sigh of relief . " well , at any rate , people can not admire her now , " she said . " it is a year since she died . i ate her heart for my supper . " " are you sure of that , your majesty ? " asked the trout , with a twinkle in his eye . " it seems to me it is but a year since she married the gallant young prince who came from abroad to seek her hand . she returned with him to his own country . "
