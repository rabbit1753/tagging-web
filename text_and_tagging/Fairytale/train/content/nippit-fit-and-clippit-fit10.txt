the prince 's ambassador was delighted that he had at last found a wife for his master , and he mounted his horse and rode off at full speed to tell him the good news . when the prince heard of the success of his errand , he ordered all his courtiers to be ready to accompany him next day when he went to bring home his bride . you can fancy what excitement there was at the laird 's house when the gallant company arrived , with their prince at their head , to greet the lady who was to be their princess . the old mother and the plain - looking maid - of - all - work ran hither and thither , fetching such meat and drink as the house could boast to set before their high - born visitors , while the bonnie little sister went and hid herself behind a great pot which stood in the corner of the courtyard , and which was used for boiling hen 's meat . she knew that her foot was the smallest in the house ; and something told her that if the prince once got a glimpse of her he would not be content till she had tried on the slipper . meanwhile , the selfish elder sister did not help at all , but ran up to her chamber , and decked herself out in all the fine clothes that she possessed before she came downstairs to meet the prince . and when all the knights and courtiers had drunk a stirrup - cup , and wished good luck to their lord and his bride , she was lifted up behind the prince on his horse , and rode off so full of her own importance , that she even forgot to say good - bye to her mother and sister .
