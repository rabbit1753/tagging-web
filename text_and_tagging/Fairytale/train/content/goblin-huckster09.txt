there he stood on the cold landing , with the autumn wind blowing down upon him through the trapdoor . it was very cold , but the little creature did not really feel it till the light in the garret went out and the tones of music died away . then how he shivered and crept downstairs again to his warm corner , where he felt at home and comfortable ! and when christmas came again and brought the dish of jam and the great lump of butter , he liked the huckster best of all .
