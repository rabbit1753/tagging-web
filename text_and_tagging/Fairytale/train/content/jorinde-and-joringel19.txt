at last the woman came back again , and said in a gruff voice , ' good evening , zachiel ; when the young moon shines in the basket , you are freed early , zachiel . ' then joringel was free . he fell on his knees before the old woman and implored her to give him back his jorinde , but she said he should never have her again , and then went away . he called after her , he wept and lamented , but all in vain . ' what is to become of me ! ' he thought . then he went away , and came at last to a strange village , where he kept sheep for a long time . he often went round the castle while he was there , but never too close . at last he dreamt one night that he had found a blood - red flower , which had in its centre a beautiful large pearl . he plucked this flower and went with it to the castle ; and there everything which he touched with the flower was freed from the enchantment , and he got his jorinde back again through it . when he awoke in the morning he began to seek mountain and valley to find such a flower . he sought it for eight days , and on the ninth early in the morning he found the blood - red flower . in its centre was a large dew - drop , as big as the most lovely pearl . he travelled day and night with this flower till he arrived at the castle . when he came within a hundred paces of it he did not cease to be able to move , but he went on till he reached the gate .
