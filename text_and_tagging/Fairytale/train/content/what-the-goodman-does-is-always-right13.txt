then the landlord 's coach came to the door , and the two englishmen and the peasant got in , and away they drove . soon they had stopped at the peasant 's hut . " good evening , old woman . " " good evening , old man . " " i 've made the exchange . " " ah , well , you understand what you 're about , " said the woman . then she embraced him , and paid no attention to the strangers , nor did she notice the sack . " i got a cow in exchange for the horse . " " oh , how delightful ! " said she . " now we shall have plenty of milk , and butter , and cheese on the table . that was a capital exchange . " " yes , but i changed the cow for a sheep . " " ah , better still ! " cried the wife . " you always think of everything ; we have just enough pasture for a sheep . ewe 's milk and cheese , woolen jackets and stockings ! the cow could not give all these , and her hairs only fall off . how you think of everything !
