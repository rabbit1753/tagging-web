' these coffins , ' she said , ' were intended for your brothers , but they stole secretly away before you were born . ' then she to tell her all that had happened , and when she had finished her daughter said : ' do not cry , dearest mother ; i will go and seek my brothers till i find them . ' so she took the twelve shirts and went on straight into the middle of the big wood . she walked all day long , and came in the evening to the little enchanted house . she stepped in and found a youth who , marvelling at her beauty , at the royal robes she wore , and at the golden star on her forehead , asked her where she came from and whither she was going . ' i am a princess , ' she answered , ' and am seeking for my twelve brothers . i mean to wander as far as the blue sky stretches over the earth till i find them . '
