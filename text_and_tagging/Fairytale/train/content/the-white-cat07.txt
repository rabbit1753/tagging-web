the white cat herself was riding a monkey , which climbed even up to the eagles ' nests when she had a fancy for the young eaglets . never was there a pleasanter hunting party , and when they returned to the castle the prince and the white cat supped together as before , but when they had finished she offered him a crystal goblet , which must have contained a magic draught , for , as soon as he had swallowed its contents , he forgot everything , even the little dog that he was seeking for the king , and only thought how happy he was to be with the white cat ! and so the days passed , in every kind of amusement , until the year was nearly gone . the prince had forgotten all about meeting his brothers : he did not even know what country he belonged to ; but the white cat knew when he ought to go back , and one day she said to him : " do you know that you have only three days left to look for the little dog for your father , and your brothers have found lovely ones ?
