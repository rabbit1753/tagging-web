months passed and no news came from rose of evening , so that aduan went about full of longing and despair . now mother hia went every day to the castle of the god of the wu river . so aduan told her that rose of evening was his cousin , and entreated her to take him along with her so that he could at least see her a single time . so she took him along , and let him stay at the lodge - house of the river - god for a few days . but the indwellers of the castle were so strictly watched that he could not see rose of evening even a single time . sadly aduan went back again .
