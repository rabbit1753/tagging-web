they told arthur how they had sped , and they all took counsel together , and agreed that they must set out on the quest for mabon the son of modron , and gwrhyr , who knew the languages of beasts and of birds , went with them . so they journeyed until they came to the nest of an ousel , and gwrhyr spoke to her . ' tell me if thou knowest aught of mabon the son of modron , who was taken when three nights old from between his mother and the wall . ' and the ousel answered : ' when i first came here i was a young bird , and there was a smith 's anvil in this place . but from that time no work has been done upon it , save that every evening i have pecked at it , till now there is not so much as the size of a nut remaining thereof . yet all that time i have never once heard of the man you name . still , there is a race of beasts older than i , and i will guide you to them .
