when they came to the house of the guardian of the pass , red clouds appeared in the sky . the guardian understood this sign and knew that a holy man was drawing near . so he went out to meet him and took him into his house . he questioned him with regard to hidden knowledge , but laotsze only stuck out his tongue at him and would not say a word . nevertheless , the guardian of the pass treated him with the greatest respect in his home . laotsze 's servant told the servant of the guardian that his master owed him a great deal of money , and begged the latter to put in a good word for him . when the guardian 's servant heard how large a sum it was , he was tempted to win so wealthy a man for a son - in - law , and he married him to his daughter . finally the guardian heard of the matter and came to laotsze together with the servant . then laotsze said to his servant : " you rascally servant . you really should have been dead long ago . i hired you , and since i was poor and could give you no money , i gave you a life - giving talisman to eat . that is how you still happen to be alive . i said to you : ' if you will follow me into the west , the land of blessed repose , i will pay you your wages in yellow gold . but you did not wish to do this . ' " and with that he patted his servant 's neck . there upon the latter opened his mouth , and spat out the life - giving talisman . the magic signs written on it with cinnabar , quite fresh and well - preserved , might still be seen . but the servant suddenly collapsed and turned into a heap of dry bones .
