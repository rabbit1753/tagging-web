a long time passed , and with each succeeding day the king 's daughter grew taller and more beautiful , and her father granted her every wish . now there were a number of women who had nothing to do but wait on the princess and carry out her commands . among them was a woman who had formerly married and had two daughters . she had an engaging appearance , a smooth tongue and a winning way of talking , and she was as soft and pliable as silk ; but at heart she was full of machinations and falseness . now when the queen died , she at once began to plan how she might marry the king , so that her daughters might be kept like royal princesses . with this end in view , she drew the young princess to her . she paid her the most fulsome compliments on everything she said and did , and was forever bringing the conversation around to how happy she would be were the king to take another wife . there was much said on this head , early and late , and before very long the princess came to believe that the woman knew all there was to know about everything . so she asked her what sort of a woman the king ought to choose for a wife . the woman answered as sweet as honey : " it is not my affair to give advice in this matter ; yet he should choose for queen some one who is kind to the little princess . for one thing i know , and that is , were i fortunate enough to be chosen , my one thought would be to do all i could for the little princess , and if she wished to wash her hands , one of my daughters would have to hold the wash - bowl and the other hand her the towel . " this and much more she told the king 's daughter , and the princess believed it , as children will .
