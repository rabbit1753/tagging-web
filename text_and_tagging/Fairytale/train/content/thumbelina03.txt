one night , when she was lying in her pretty little bed , an old toad crept in through a broken pane in the window . she was very ugly , clumsy , and clammy ; she hopped on to the table where thumbelina lay asleep under the red rose - leaf . ' this would make a beautiful wife for my son,'said the toad , taking up the walnut - shell , with thumbelina inside , and hopping with it through the window into the garden . there flowed a great wide stream , with slippery and marshy banks ; here the toad lived with her son . ugh ! how ugly and clammy he was , just like his mother ! ' croak , croak , croak!'was all he could say when he saw the pretty little girl in the walnut - shell .
