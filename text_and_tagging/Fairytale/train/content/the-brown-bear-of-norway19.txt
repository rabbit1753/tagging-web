when night came on she was let into the palace and lay down till the prince was in such a dead sleep that all she did could n't awake him . she sung this verse to him , sighing and sobbing , and kept singing it the night long , and it was all in vain : four long years i was married to thee ; three sweet babes i bore to thee ; brown bear of norway , turn to me . at the first dawn the proud lady was in the chamber , and led her away , and the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was quitting the palace . so there was no luck so far ; but the next day the prince passed by again and looked at her , and saluted her kindly , as a prince might a farmer 's daughter , and passed one ; and soon the witch 's daughter passed by , and found her combing her hair , and pearls and diamonds dropping from it . well , another bargain was made , and the princess spent another night of sorrow , and she left the castle at daybreak , and the footman was at his post and enjoyed his revenge .
