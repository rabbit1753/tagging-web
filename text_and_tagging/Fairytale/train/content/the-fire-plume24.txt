the cousin of wassamo recovered heart , and sang once more his sad or mirthful chants , just as the humor was upon him ; but he kept close by wassamo , and watched him in all his movements . he made it a point to ask many questions of the country he came from ; some of which his cousin replied to , but others were left entirely in the dark . at every thunder - storm , as the old sand - spirit had foreboded , the wife of wassamo disappeared , much to the astonishment of her indian company , and , to their greater wonder , she was never idle , night nor day . when the winter came on , wassamo prepared for her a comfortable lodge , to which she withdrew for her long sleep ; and he gave notice to his friends that they must not disturb her , as she would not be with them again until the spring returned . before lying down , she said to her husband , " no one but yourself must pass on this side of the lodge . " the winter passed away with snows , and sports and stones in the lodge ; and when the sap of the maple began to flow , the wife of wassamo wakened , and she immediately set about work as before . she helped at the maple - trees with the others ; and , as if luck were in her presence , the sugar - harvest was greater than had been ever known in all that region .
