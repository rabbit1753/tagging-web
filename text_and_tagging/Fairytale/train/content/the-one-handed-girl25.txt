' kill her , ' he said . ' it is no more than she deserves for daring to marry the king 's son . then she can do no more hurt to anyone . ' ' we can not kill her , ' answered they ; ' if we did , our son would assuredly kill us . let us do as the others did , and put her out of the town . and with this the envious brother was forced to be content . ' the poor girl loved her husband very much , but just then the baby was more to her than all else in the world , and as long as she had him with her , she did not very much mind anything . so , taking her son on her arm , and hanging a little earthen pot for cooking round her neck , she left her house with its great peacock fans and slaves and seats of ivory , and plunged into the forest .
