time passed , and the princess 's suitors decided to try their luck a second time . the king 's daughter was once more led up the glass mountain , with great pomp and richly gowned , and was seated on its topmost peak , with the golden crown on her head , and a golden apple in her hand . at the foot of the hill gathered all the suitors with handsome horses and splendid armor , and round about stood all the people to watch the contest . when all was ready the signal was given by horns and trumpets , and at the same moment the suitors , one after another , darted up the mountain with all their might . but all took place as at the first time . the mountain was high , and as slippery as ice , and besides , it was steep beyond all measure ; not one rode up more than a little way before tumbling down again head over heels . meanwhile there was much noise , and the horses neighed , and the people shouted , and the armor clashed , so that the tumult and the shouting sounded far into the deep wood .
