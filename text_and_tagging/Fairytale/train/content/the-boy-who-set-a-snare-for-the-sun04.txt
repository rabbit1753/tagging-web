it was a charming place to lie upon , and he fell asleep . while sleeping , the sun beat so hot upon him that it not only singed his bird - skin coat , but it so shrivelled and shrunk and tightened it upon the little boy 's body , as to wake him up . when he felt how the sun had seared and the mischief its fiery beams had played with the coat he was so proud of , he flew into a great passion , and berated the sun in a terrible way for a little boy no higher than a man 's knee . he vowed fearful things against it . " do not think you are too high , " said he ; " i shall revenge myself . oh , sun ! i will have you for a plaything yet . " on coming home he gave an account of his misfortune to his sister , and bitterly bewailed the spoiling of his new coat . he would not eat - not so much as a single berry . he lay down as one that fasts ; nor did he move nor change his manner of lying for ten full days , though his sister strove to prevail on him to rise . at the end of ten days he turned over , and then he lay full ten days on the other side .
