the king of the polar bears lived among the icebergs in the far north country . he was old and monstrous big ; he was wise and friendly to all who knew him . his body was thickly covered with long , white hair that glistened like silver under the rays of the midnight sun . his claws were strong and sharp , that he might walk safely over the smooth ice or grasp and tear the fishes and seals upon which he fed . the seals were afraid when he drew near , and tried to avoid him ; but the gulls , both white and gray , loved him because he left the remnants of his feasts for them to devour . often his subjects , the polar bears , came to him for advice when ill or in trouble ; but they wisely kept away from his hunting grounds , lest they might interfere with his sport and arouse his anger .
