and he fared forth over mountains and tangled ways , and came into the heart of a sombre forest . there he met the gray - beard of whom i have already told you . and when he met him the youth was much pleased , and said : " good - day , grandfather , and thanks for the last time ! " and the old man replied : " good - day to you , and whither away ? " the youth answered : " i am wandering out into the world to see what fortune has in store for me . " then the old man said : " keep right on going till you come to the royal castle , and there your fortune will take a turn . " and with that they parted . the youth followed the old man 's advice and for a time wandered on straight ahead . when he came to a tavern he played his flute and let his dogs dance , and was never at a lack for bed and board , and whatever else he might want .
