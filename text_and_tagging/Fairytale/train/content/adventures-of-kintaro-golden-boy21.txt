" and you , mother , have you no thought of taking your child to the capital , and of teaching him to carry a sword as befits a samurai ( a japanese knight ) ? " " you are very kind to take so much interest in my son . " replied the mother ; " but he is as you see , wild and uneducated . i fear it would be very difficult to do as you say . because of his great strength as an infant i hid him away in this unknown part of the country , for he hurt every one that came near him . i have often wished that i could , one day , see my boy a knight wearing two swords . but as we have no influential friend to introduce us at the capital , i fear my hope will never come true .
