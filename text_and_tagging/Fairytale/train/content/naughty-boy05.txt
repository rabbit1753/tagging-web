" why , your bow is quite spoiled , " said the old poet . " that were sad indeed , " said the boy , and he took the bow in his hand and examined it on every side . " oh , it is dry again , and is not hurt at all . the string is quite tight . i will try it directly . " and he bent his bow , took aim , and shot an arrow at the old poet , right into his heart . " you see now that my bow was not spoiled , " said he laughing ; and away he ran . the naughty boy , to shoot the old poet in that way ! he who had taken him into his warm room , who had treated him so kindly , and who had given him warm wine and the very best apples ! the poor poet lay on the earth and wept , for the arrow had really flown into his heart . " fie ! " said he . " how naughty a boy cupid is ! i will tell all children about him , that they may take care and not play with him , for he will only cause them sorrow and many a heartache . "
