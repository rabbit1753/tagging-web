" then finn flung back his cloak of wild boars ' skins , and holding his father 's treasure - bag in his hand before them all , cried in a loud voice : " i am finn , the son of cool , the son of trenmor , the son of basna ; i am he whom the sons of morna have been seeking to destroy from the time that i was born ; and here to - night , o king of the kings of erin , i claim the fulfilment of thy promise , and the restoration of my inheritance , which is the fian leadership of fail . " thereupon gaul mac morna put his right hand into finn 's , and became his man . then his brothers and his sons , and the sons of his brothers , did so in succession , and after that all the chief men of the fians did the same , and that night finn was solemnly and surely installed in the fian leadership of erin , and put in possession of all the woods and forests and waste places , and all the hills and mountains and promontories , and all the streams and rivers of erin , and the harbours and estuaries and the harbour - dues of the merchants , and all ships and boats and galleys with their mariners , and all that pertained of old time to the fian leadership of fail .
