next day the weather was perfectly delicious : the sun shone all over the green docks , and the mother duck and all her family came out , and down to the moat . splash ! into the water went she . " quack , quack ! " she said , and one duckling after another plumped in . the water went over their heads , but they were up again in a moment and swam beautifully . their legs worked of themselves , and now they were all out in the water , and even the ugly grey one was swimming with them . " no , no , that 's no turkey , " she said . " look how nicely he uses his legs , and how well he holds himself up . that 's my own child ! he 's really quite handsome if you look at him properly . quack , quack ! come along with me and i 'll take you out into the world and introduce you to the duck - yard , but mind and keep close to me so that nobody can tread on you , and do look out for the cat .
