" i ca n't help myself , " said hans , " i have this great lump to carry . to be sure , it is gold , but then i ca n't hold my head straight for it , and it hurts my shoulder . " " i 'll tell you what , " said the horseman , " we will change . i will give you my horse , and you shall give me your lump of gold . " " with all my heart , " said hans . " but i warn you , you will find it heavy . " and the horseman got down and took the gold . helping hans up , he gave the reins into his hand . " when you want to go fast , " said he , " you must click your tongue and cry ' gee - up ! ' "
