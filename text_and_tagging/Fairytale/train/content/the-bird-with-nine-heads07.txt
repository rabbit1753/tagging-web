" if that is the case , " said the dragon , " then come into the sea with me and we will live there together . " then the youth recognized him for the same dragon whom he had seen in the cave . and with him was the youth with whom he had formed a bond of brotherhood : he was the dragon 's son . " since you have saved my son and become his brother , i am your father , " said the old dragon . and he entertained him hospitably with food and wine . one day his friend said to him : " my father is sure to want to reward you . but accept no money , nor any jewels from him , but only the little gourd flask over yonder . with it you can conjure up whatever you wish . " and , sure enough , the old dragon asked him what he wanted by way of a reward , and the youth answered : " i want no money , nor any jewels . all i want is the little gourd flask over yonder . " at first the dragon did not wish to give it up , but at last he did let him have it , after all . and then the youth left the dragon 's castle .
