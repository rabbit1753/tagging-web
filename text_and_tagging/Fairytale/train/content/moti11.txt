they had not very far to go , but moti 's little pony , weighted with a heavy man and two big rocks , soon began to lag behind the cavalry , and would have lagged behind the infantry too , only they were not very anxious to be too early in the fight , and hung back so as to give moti plenty of time . the young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time , until at last , getting impatient at the slowness of the pony , he gave him such a tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper and bolted . first one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of dust to one side of the road , whilst moti nearly rolled off too , but clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane , and , dropping his staff , held on for dear life . then , fortunately the other rock broke away from his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine . meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when moti came dashing by , yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony : ' you wait till i get hold of you ! i 'll skin you alive ! i 'll wring your neck ! i 'll break every bone in your body ! ' the cavalry thought that this dreadful language was meant for the enemy , and were filled with admiration of his courage . many of their horses too were quite upset by this whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst , and in a few minutes , after a little plunging and rearing and kicking , the whole troop were following on moti 's heels .
