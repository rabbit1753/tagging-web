the prince did as she bade him , and the maiden again combed his hair with a golden comb until he fell asleep . when he awoke the sun was setting , and his work was done . he heard the old witch coming , so up he jumped to the roof of the stable and began laying a feather here and a feather there , for all the world as though he were just finishing his task . " you never did that work alone , " said the old witch . " that may be so , and that may not be so , " said the prince ; " all the same , it was none of your doing . so now may i have the one who draws the water and builds the fire ? " but the witch shook her head . " no , " said she , " there is still another task to do before that . over yonder is a fir - tree ; on the tree is a crow 's nest , and in the nest are three eggs . if you can harry that nest to - morrow between the rising and the setting of the sun , neither breaking nor leaving a single egg , you shall have that for which you ask .
