the following day the prince of the dragon 's cave held a review of his dancers . when all the dancers had assembled , the dance of the ogres was danced first . those who performed it all wore devil - masks and garments of scales . they beat upon enormous cymbals , and their kettledrums were so large that four men could just about span them . their sound was like the sound of a mighty thunder , and the noise was so great that nothing else could be heard . when the dance began , tremendous waves spouted up to the very skies , and then fell down again like star - glimmer which scatters in the air .
