but notscha said : " tell me who you are before we fight . " " i am the son of the dragon - king , " was the reply . " and i am notscha , the son of general li dsing . you must not rouse my anger with your violence , or i will skin you , together with that old mud - fish , your father ! " then the dragon grew wild with rage , and came storming along furiously . but notscha cast his crimson cloth into the air , so that it flashed like a ball of fire , and cast the dragon - youth from his breast . then notscha took his golden armlet and struck him on the forehead with it , so that he had to reveal himself in his true form as a golden dragon , and fall down dead . notscha laughed and said : " i have heard tell that dragon - sinews make good cords . i will draw one out and bring it to my father , and he can tie his armor together with it . " and with that he drew out the dragon 's back sinew and took it home . in the meantime the dragon - king , full of fury , had hastened to notscha 's father li dsing and demanded that notscha be delivered up to him . but li dsing replied : " you must be mistaken , for my boy is only seven years old and incapable of committing such misdeeds . " while they were still quarreling notscha came running up and cried : " father , i 'm bringing along a dragon 's sinew for you , so that you may bind up your armor with it ! " now the dragon broke out into tears and furious scolding . he threatened to report li dsing to the ruler of the heaven , and took himself off , snorting with rage .
