her relatives and the court said farewell to her with many tears , left her before eleven , locked the door on the outside , and took the keys with them to the castle . the wise woman was also there , consoled the people , and assured them that if the maiden only forbore to speak , and did not turn around , she would come out in the morning fresh and blooming . the poor girl prayed and wept until she grew sleepy ; but toward twelve o'clock the outer door suddenly opened , and then the door of the drawing - room . she was startled and filled with fear when , her face turned toward the wall , she saw in the great mirror , how a tall , well - built youth entered , from whose garments the water ran in streams to the floor . he shook himself as though freezing , and said " uh hu ! " then he went to the window , and there laid down an unusually large and handsome apple , and hung a bottle in the casement . next he stepped to the bed , bent over the sleeping girl and looked at her , strode up and down a few times , shaking the water from his clothes and saying " uh hu ! " then he went back to the bed , undressed hurriedly , lay down and fell asleep .
