" but this time the prince said , " i see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me , and over yonder is a glass hill , and on the hill is a house that shines like fire . " " that is where the witch with three eyes lives , " said the swan maiden ; " and now listen : when she asks you what it is that you came for , ask her to give you the one who draws the water and builds the fire ; for that is myself . " so , when they had come to the top of the hill of glass , the king 's son stepped down to the ground , and the swan flew over the roof . rap ! tap ! tap ! he knocked at the door , and the old witch herself came and opened it . " and what do you want here ? " said she . " i want the one who draws the water and builds the fire , " said the prince . at this the old witch scowled until her eyebrows met .
