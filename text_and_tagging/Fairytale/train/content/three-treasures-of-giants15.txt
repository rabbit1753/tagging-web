jack remained here for many days , doing nothing , and - as far as anybody knew - eating nothing . this conduct puzzled his brothers greatly , and they put such constant questions to him , that at length he told them the secret of the table , and even gave a dinner to them , which far outdid any they had ever seen or heard of . but though they had solemnly promised to reveal nothing , somehow or other the tale leaked out , and before long reached the ears of the king himself . that very evening his chamberlain arrived at jack 's dwelling , with a request from the king that he might borrow the table for three days . ' very well , ' answered jack , ' you can take it back with you . but tell his majesty that if he does not return it at the end of the three days i will make war upon him . ' so the chamberlain carried away the table and took it straight to the king , telling him at the same time of jack 's threat , at which they both laughed till their sides ached .
