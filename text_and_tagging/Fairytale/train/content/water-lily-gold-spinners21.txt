the swallows flew away , and the prince rode on to the bridge . there he waited , hoping to hear the song . but he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind , and , disappointed , rode home . shortly after , he was sitting in the garden , thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message , when he saw an eagle flying above him . the bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the prince and said : " the wizard of finland greets you and bids me say that you may free the maiden thus : go to the river and smear yourself all over with mud ; then say : ' from a man into a crab , ' and you will become a crab . plunge boldly into the water , swim as close as you can to the water - lily 's roots , and loosen them from the mud and reeds . this done , fasten your claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface . let the water flow all over the flower , and drift with the current until you come to a mountain ash tree on the left bank . there is near it a large stone . stop there and say : ' from a crab into a man , from a water - lily into a maiden , ' and you both will be restored to your own forms .
