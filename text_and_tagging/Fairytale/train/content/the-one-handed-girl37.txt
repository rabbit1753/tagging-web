at last one morning , after the girl had been lying awake all night thinking of her husband , she said to her friend the snake : ' you have all shown me much kindness , but now i am well again , and want to go home and hear some news of my husband , and if he still mourns for me ! ' now the heart of the snake was sad at her words , but he only said : ' yes , thus it must be ; go and bid farewell to my father and mother , but if they offer you a present , see that you take nothing but my father 's ring and my mother 's casket . ' so she went to the parent snakes , who wept bitterly at the thought of losing her , and offered her gold and jewels as much as she could carry in remembrance of them . but the girl shook her head and pushed the shining heap away from her . ' i shall never forget you , never , ' she said in a broken voice , ' but the only tokens i will accept from you are that little ring and this old casket . '
