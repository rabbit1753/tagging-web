and it seemed to her as though she knew all the people who were there . they were the women of the village , and the girls of her own age . but the dog was well aware that there was something uncanny about it all . he made his way down to melbustad in flying leaps , and howled and barked in the most lamentable manner , and gave the people no rest until they followed him . the young fellow who was to marry the girl took his gun , and climbed the hills . when he drew near , there stood a number of horses around the hut , saddled and bridled . he crept up to the hut , looked through a loop - hole in the wall , and saw a whole company sitting together inside . it was quite evident that they were trolls , the people from underground , and therefore he discharged his gun over the roof . at that moment the doors flew open , and a number of balls of gray yarn , one larger than the other , came shooting out about his legs . when he went in , there sat the maiden in her bridal finery , and nothing was missing but the ring on her little finger , then all would have been complete .
