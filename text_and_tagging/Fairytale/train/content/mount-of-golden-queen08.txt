the giant asked him about the mount of the golden queen , but he knew nothing of it . again the giant blew his whistle in every direction to call together all the fishes to be found in the waters . they came at once , and he asked them about the mount of the golden queen ; but they knew nothing of it . once more the giant blew his whistle in every direction , and called together all the birds of the air . they came , and he asked the eagle about the mount of the golden queen , and whether he knew where it might be . the eagle said : " yes ! " " well then , take this lad there , " said the giant " but do not treat him unkindly ! " this the eagle promised , allowed the youth to seat himself on his back , and then off they were through the air , over fields and forests , hill and dale . before long they were above the ocean , and could see nothing but sky and water .
