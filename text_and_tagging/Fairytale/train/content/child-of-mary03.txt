after a time the foster - mother wanted to take another journey , and she forbade the girl , above all , to go into the two rooms which , as yet , she had not entered . and the girl promised her that this time she would obey her . but when she had been alone for some time , and had had all sorts of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room , she could no longer resist opening the second door a little way - and swish ! out flew the moon . when the foster - mother returned , and saw the moon had slipped out , she again grieved greatly , and told the girl she could keep her no longer , and that now she must go . but when the girl again began to cry bitterly , and pleaded with such grace that it was impossible to deny her , she was once more allowed to remain .
