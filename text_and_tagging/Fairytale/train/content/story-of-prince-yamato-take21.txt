and with these noble words , takeru fell back and died . the prince having thus successfully put an end to his father 's enemies in the world , was prepared to return to the capital . on the way back he passed through the province of idum . here he met with another outlaw named idzumo takeru who he knew had done much harm in the land . he again resorted to stratagem , and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name . having done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword . this he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion when he expected to meet the third robber takeru . he now invited takeru to the bank of the river hinokawa , and persuaded him to try a swim with him in the cool refreshing waters of the river . as it was a hot summer 's day , the rebel was nothing loath to take a plunge in the river , while his enemy was still swimming down the stream the prince turned back and landed with all possible haste . unperceived , he managed to change swords , putting his wooden one in place of the keen steel sword of takeru . knowing nothing of this , the brigand came up to the bank shortly . as soon as he had landed and donned his clothes , the prince came forward and asked him to cross swords with him to prove his skill , saying : " let us two prove which is the better swordsman of the two !
