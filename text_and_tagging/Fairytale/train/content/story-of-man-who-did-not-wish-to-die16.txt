the emperor ordered jofuku to set out for the land of horaizan , to find the hermits , and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir . he gave jofuku one of his best junks , fitted it out for him , and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for jofuku to take as presents to the hermits . jofuku sailed for the land of horaizan , but he never returned to the waiting emperor . but ever since that time mount fuji has been said to be the fabled horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir . it has been said that jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god . this odd answer irritated sentaro very much . he thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way . so he decided to go at once to the shrine of jofuku , who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of japan . sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days , entreating jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find .
