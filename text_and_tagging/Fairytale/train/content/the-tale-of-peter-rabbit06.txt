peter sat down to rest ; he was out of breath and trembling with fright , and he had not the least idea which way to go . also he was very damp with sitting in that can . after a time he began to wander about , going lippity -- lippity -- not very fast , and looking all around . he found a door in a wall ; but it was locked , and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath . an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep , carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood . peter asked her the way to the gate , but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer . she only shook her head at him . peter began to cry .
