when she reached the church , she took torre jeppe on her back , carried him home and sat him down on the bench beside the tailors . they timidly moved away ; but torre jeppe moved after them , and looked at them with his big eyes until they nearly lost their reason . in their terror they begged the girl in the name of god to deliver them from the specter . they would gladly give her another dress if she would only carry the dead man away again . they had no need to tell her twice , for she took torre jeppe on her back , and dragged him away again .
