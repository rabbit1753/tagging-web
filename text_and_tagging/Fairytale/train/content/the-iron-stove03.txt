then she went away , and told the old king that the thing inside the iron stove would not have her , but wanted the princess . the old king was frightened , and his daughter wept . but they had a swineherd 's daughter who was even more beautiful than the miller 's daughter , and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the princess . then she was taken out , and had to scrape for four - and - twenty hours , but she could make no impression . as soon as the day broke the voice from the stove called out , ' it seems to be daylight outside . ' then she answered , ' it seems so to me too ; i think i hear my father blowing his horn . ' ' so you are a swineherd 's daughter ! go away at once , and let the king 's daughter come . and say to her that what i foretell shall come to pass , and if she does not come everything in the kingdom shall fall into ruin , and not one stone shall be left upon another .
