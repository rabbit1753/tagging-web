one christmas the two women agreed that they would ride to christmas night mass , and whichever one of them woke up at the right time was to call the other , for in those days there was no such thing as a watch . it was about midnight when one of the women thought she heard a voice from the window , calling : " i am going to set out now . " she got up hurriedly and dressed herself , so that she might be able to ride with the other woman ; but since there was no time to eat , she took a piece of bread from the table along with her . in those times it was customary to bake the bread in the shape of a cross . it was a piece of this kind that the woman took and put in her pocket , in order to eat it underway . she rode as fast as she could , to catch up with her friend , but could not overtake her .
