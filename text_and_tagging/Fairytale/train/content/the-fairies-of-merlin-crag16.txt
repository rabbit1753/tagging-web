when he awoke it was near midnight , and the moon had risen on the crag . and he rubbed his eyes , when by its soft light he became aware of a large band of fairies who were dancing round and round him , singing and laughing , pointing their tiny fingers at him , and shaking their wee fists in his face . the bewildered man rose and tried to walk away from them , but turn in whichever direction he would the fairies accompanied him , encircling him in a magic ring , out of which he could in no way go . at last they stopped , and , with shrieks of elfin laughter , led the prettiest and daintiest of their companions up to him , and cried , " tread a measure , tread a measure , oh , man ! then wilt thou not be so eager to escape from our company . " now the poor labourer was but a clumsy dancer , and he held back with a shamefaced air . but the fairy who had been chosen to be his partner reached up and seized his hands , and lo ! some strange magic seemed to enter into his veins . for in a moment he found himself waltzing and whirling , sliding and bowing , as if he had done nothing else but dance all his life . and , strangest thing of all ! he forgot about his home and his children . he felt so happy that he had no longer the slightest desire to leave the fairies ' company . all night long the merriment went on . the little folk danced and danced as if they were mad , and the farm man danced with them , until at last a shrill sound came over the moor . it was the cock from the farmyard crowing its loudest to welcome the dawn .
