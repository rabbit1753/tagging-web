the banqueting hall had been prepared for our reception at that time , and the giant was dragged into the middle of the house , and was there placed in the sight of all present . they asked him who he was . ' roc , son of diocan , is my name , ' replied he , ' that is , i am son to the legislator of aengus of the brugh in the south . my betrothed poured a current of surprising affection and a torrent of deep love upon sgiath breac , son of dathcaoin yonder , who is your foster son , o fionn . it hurt my feelings severely to hear her boast of the swiftness and bravery of her lover in particular , and of the fenians in general , and i declared that i would challenge him and all the fenians of eire to run a race with me . she sneered at me . i then went to my beloved friend , aengus of the brugh , to bemoan my fate . he metamorphosed me thus , and bestowed on me the swiftness of a druidical wind , as you have seen . this is my history for you , and you ought to be well satisfied with all the hurt and injury you have inflicted upon me already . ' " then i repented me of the indignity put upon the giant , and i released him from his bonds and i bade liagan luaimneach companion him to the presence of his betrothed one and testify to her on my behalf of his prowess in the race , wherein he had outstripped all the fenians of eire , save only myself . so the two went forth together in friendly amity , and roc , for the champion feat reported of him by liagan luaimneach , recovered the affection of his betrothed , and straightway took her to wife . from that adventure , indeed , arose the proverb , ' as roc came to the house of fionn , ' and so that is the answer to your question , o conan , " said fionn .
