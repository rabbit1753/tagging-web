' what is the matter , my dove ? ' and the girl answered , between her sobs : ' when i came in and saw the pack - saddle over my head , i thought how dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me . ' she cried louder than before . the old woman struck her hands together : ' ah , to think of it ! if that were to be , what should i do ? ' she sat down by her daughter . they both wrung their hands and let their tears flow . ' something strange must have occurred , ' exclaimed the old farmer on the moor , who by this time was not only hungry , but cross . ' i must go after them . ' and he went and found them in the stable . ' what is the matter ? ' asked he . ' oh ! ' replied his wife , ' when our daughter came home , did she not see the pack - saddle over her head . she thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall and kill her . ' ' ah , to think of it ! ' exclaimed he , striking his hands together . he sat down beside them and wept too .
