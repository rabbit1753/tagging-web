so farquhar took the little creature out carefully between his finger and thumb . he set him on the palm of his left hand . he was so shrivelled with age that he looked just like a mummy . " dost know anything of my friends , or where my father 's cottage is gone to ? " asked farquhar . for the third time , hehardly expected to get an answer . " they were all dead long before i was born , " piped out the tiny figure . " i never saw any of them , but i have heard my father speak of them . " " then i must be older than you ! " cried farquhar , in great dismay . and he got such a shock at the thought that his bones suddenly dissolved into dust . he fell , a heap of grey ashes , on the floor .
