mike by the stove thought that things were going from bad to worse , and this was the truth , since the further he went the warmer it grew . the part of the country in which he was traveling was so parched and dried that not a drop of water was to be found , and he was half - dead with thirst . for a long time he hesitated before biting into the last lemon ; but at last there was nothing else left to do . when he had bitten into it , a princess looked out : she was the most beautiful in twelve kingdoms , and she cried that if she could have no water , she must die on the spot . mike by the stove ran about and looked for water , and this time he met the king 's miller , who showed him the way to the mill - pond . when he had come with her to the mill - pond , and had given her water , she came completely out of the lemon . but she had nothing to wear , and mike by the stove had to give her his smock . she put it on , and hid in a tree ; while he was to go to the castle and bring her clothes , and tell the king he had found her , and how it had all happened . meanwhile the cook had come down to the pond to fetch water . when she saw the lovely face that was reflected in the pond , she thought it was her own , and was so pleased that she began to dance and jump around , because she had grown so beautiful .
