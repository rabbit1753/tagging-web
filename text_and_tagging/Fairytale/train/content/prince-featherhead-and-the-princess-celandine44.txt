now the princess was indeed unhappy , and could no longer bear to stay in a place where she had been so cruelly disdained . so , without even bidding farewell to the king and queen , she left the valley behind her , and wandered sadly away , not caring whither . after walking until she was weary , she saw before her a tiny house , and turned her slow steps towards it . the nearer she approached the more miserable it appeared , and at length she saw a little old woman sitting upon the door - step , who said grimly : ' here comes one of these fine beggars who are too idle to do anything but run about the country ! ' ' alas ! madam , ' said celandine , with tears in her pretty eyes , ' a sad fate forces me to ask you for shelter . ' ' did n't i tell you what it would be ? ' growled the old hag . ' from shelter we shall proceed to demand supper , and from supper money to take us on our way . upon my word , if i could be sure of finding some one every day whose head was as soft as his heart , i would n't wish for a more agreeable life myself ! but i have worked hard to build my house and secure a morsel to eat , and i suppose you think that i am to give away everything to the first passer - by who chooses to ask for it . not at all ! i wager that a fine lady like you has more money than i have . i must search her , and see if it is not so , ' she added , hobbling towards celandine with the aid of her stick . ' alas ! madam , ' replied the princess , ' i only wish i had . i would give it to you with all the pleasure in life . ' ' but you are very smartly dressed for the kind of life you lead , ' continued the old woman .
