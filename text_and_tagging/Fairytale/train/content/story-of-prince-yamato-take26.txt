prince yamato take at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into subjection . now as the king loved the prince dearly , and could not bear to have him go out of his sight even for the length of one day , he was of course very loath to send him on his dangerous expedition . but in the whole army there was no warrior so strong or so brave as the prince his son , so that his majesty , unable to do otherwise , reluctantly complied with yamato 's wish . when the time came for the prince to start , the king gave him a spear called the eight - arms - length - spear of the holly tree ( the handle was probably made from the wood of the holly tree ) , and ordered him to set out to subjugate the eastern barbarians as the ainu were then called .
