on the following day there was to be a wedding at the castle , and not only was the older prince to marry , but the one who had stayed with the giant as well , and he was to get the other bride 's sister . but when they entered the coach and were about to drive to church , one of the axles broke . they took another , and then a third , but all of them broke , no matter what kind of wood they used . it took a great deal of time , and they did not move from the spot , and got all out of sorts . then the bailiff said , for he had also been invited to the wedding at the castle , that a maiden lived out in the forest , and " if they could only get the loan of her poker , it would be sure to hold . " so they sent to the little house in the forest , and asked most politely whether the maiden would not loan them the poker of which the bailiff had spoken . and they got it , too , and then they had an axle that would not break .
