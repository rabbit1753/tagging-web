the thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree , and that the dog had scented it , at last struck the old man . he ran back to the house , fetched his spade and began to dig the ground at that spot . what was his astonishment when , after digging for some time , he came upon a heap of old and valuable coins . the deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find . so intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering at him through the bamboo hedge . at last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground . shiro sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say , " you see , though only a dog , i can make some return for all the kindness you show me . " the old man ran in to call his wife , and together they carried home the treasure . thus in one day the poor old man became rich . his gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds . he loved and petted him more than ever , if that were possible . the cross old neighbor , attracted by shiro 's barking , had been an unseen and envious witness of the finding of the treasure . he began to think that he , too , would like to find a fortune . so a few days later he called at the old man 's house and very ceremoniously asked permission to borrow shiro for a short time .
