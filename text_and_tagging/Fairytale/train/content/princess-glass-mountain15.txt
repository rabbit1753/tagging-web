and when the day set by the king had arrived , the princess was led up the glass mountain . there she sat on its highest peak , with a golden crown on her head , and a golden apple in her hand , and she looked so immeasurably lovely that there was no one who would not have liked to risk his life for her . just below the foot of the hill all the suitors assembled with splendid horses and glittering armor , that shone like fire in the sun , and from round about the people flocked together in great crowds to watch their tilting . and when everything was ready , the signal was given by horns and trumpets , and then the suitors , one after another , raced up the mountain with all their might . but the mountain was high , as slippery as ice , and besides it was steep beyond all measure . not one of the suitors rode up more than a little way , before he tumbled down again , head over heels , and it might well happen that arms and legs were broken in the process . this made so great a noise , together with the neighing of the horses , the shouting of the people , and the clash of arms , that the tumult and the shouting could be heard far away .
