' well -- as i said -- afther flutterin ' over the wood a little bit , to plaze herself , the goose flew down , and bit at the foot o ' the king , as fresh as a daisy , after flyin ' round his dominions , just as if she had n't flew three perch . ' ' well , my dear , it was a beautiful sight to see the king standin ' with his mouth open , lookin ' at his poor old goose flyin ' as light as a lark , and better nor ever she was . when she let at his foot he patted her an the head , and ma vourneen , ' says he , ' but you are the darling o ' the world . ' ' and what do you say to me , ' says saint kavin , ' for makin ' her the like ? ' ' by gor , ' says the king , " i say nothin' about the art o ' men , barrin ' the bees . " ' and do you say no more nor that ? ' says saint kavin . ' and that i 'm beholden to you , ' says the king . ' but will you give me all the ground the goose flew over ? ' says saint kavin . ' i will , ' says king o'toole , ' and you 're welcome to it , ' says he , ' though it 's the last acre i have to give . ' ' but you 'll keep your word true ? ' says the saint . ' as true as the sun , ' says the king .
