so the girl related all her history , and what had happened to her , and when the mother heard how she came to have such great riches she began to wish that her ugly and idle daughter might have the same good fortune . so she sent her to sit by the well and spin ; and in order to make her spindle bloody she put her hand into the thorn hedge . then she threw the spindle into the well , and jumped in herself . she found herself , like her sister , in the beautiful meadow , and followed the same path , and when she came to the baker 's oven , the bread cried out , " oh , take me out , take me out , or i shall burn ; i am quite done already ! " but the lazy - bones answered , " i have no desire to black my hands , " and went on farther . soon she came to the apple - tree , who called out , " oh , shake me , shake me , we apples are all of us ripe ! " but she answered , " that is all very fine ; suppose one of you should fall on my head , " and went on farther . when she came to mother hulda 's house she did not feel afraid , as she knew beforehand of her great teeth , and entered into her service at once . the first day she put her hand well to the work , and was industrious , and did everything mother hulda bade her , because of the gold she expected ; but the second day she began to be idle , and the third day still more so , so that she would not get up in the morning . neither did she make mother hulda 's bed as it ought to have been made , and did not shake it for the feathers to fly about . so that mother hulda soon grew tired of her , and gave her warning , at which the lazy thing was well pleased , and thought that now the shower of gold was coming ; so mother hulda led her to the door , and as she stood in the doorway , instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her .
