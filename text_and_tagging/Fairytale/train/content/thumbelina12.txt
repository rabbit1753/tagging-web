just outside the wood where she was now living lay a great corn - field . but the corn had been gone a long time ; only the dry , bare stubble was left standing in the frozen ground . this made a forest for her to wander about in . all at once she came across the door of a field - mouse , who had a little hole under a corn - stalk . there the mouse lived warm and snug , with a store - room full of corn , a splendid kitchen and dining - room . poor little thumbelina went up to the door and begged for a little piece of barley , for she had not had anything to eat for the last two days . ' poor little creature!'said the field - mouse , for she was a kind - hearted old thing at the bottom . ' come into my warm room and have some dinner with me . ' as thumbelina pleased her , she said : ' as far as i am concerned you may spend the winter with me ; but you must keep my room clean and tidy , and tell me stories , for i like that very much . ' and thumbelina did all that the kind old field - mouse asked , and did it remarkably well too .
