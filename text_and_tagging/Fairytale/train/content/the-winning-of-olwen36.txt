up and down the country went trwyth the boar , and arthur followed after him , till they came to the severn sea . there three knights caught his feet unawares and plunged him into the water , while one snatched the razor from him , and another seized the scissors . but before they laid hold of the comb he had shaken them all off , and neither man nor horse nor dog could reach him till he came to cornwall , whither arthur had sworn he should not go . thither arthur followed after him with his knights , and if it had been hard to win the razor and the scissors , the struggle for the comb was fiercer still , but at length arthur prevailed , and the boar was driven into the sea . and whether he was drowned or where he went no man knows to this day .
