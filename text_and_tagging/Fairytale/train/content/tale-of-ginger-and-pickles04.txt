ginger and pickles gave unlimited credit . now the meaning of " credit " is this -- when a customer buys a bar of soap , instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it -- she says she will pay another time . and pickles makes a low bow and says , " with pleasure , madam , " and it is written down in a book . the customers come again and again , and buy quantities , in spite of being afraid of ginger and pickles . but there is no money in what is called the " till . " the customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities , especially the toffee customers . but there was always no money ; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints . but the sales were enormous , ten times as large as tabitha twitchit 's . as there was always no money , ginger and pickles were obliged to eat their own goods . pickles ate biscuits and ginger ate a dried haddock . they ate them by candle - light after the shop was closed .
