" what have you under your apron ? " said the king . but to this the princess could not answer a single word . then somebody who stood near snatched away her apron , and there was the basket full of kitchen scrapings , and all the time the princess stood so heart - struck with shame that she saw nothing but the cracks in the floor . but the king stepped down from his golden throne , dressed all in his golden robes , just as he was , and took the princess by the hand . " and do you not know me ? " said he ; " look ! i am the gooseherd . " and so he was ! she could see it easily enough now , but that made her more ashamed than ever . and listen : the king had more to tell her yet . he was the tipsy countryman and had knocked over her basket of eggs himself , and more than that he was the swineherd who had driven his pigs over her basket of apples so that they were spilled on the ground . but the princess only bowed her head lower and lower , for her pride was broken .
