the abbot of inisfalen awoke before dawn of day . under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray . the lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep . and wrapt in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep . low kneel'd the abbot cormac when the dawn was dim and gray . the prayers of his holy office he faithfully began to say . low kneel'd the abbot cormac while the dawn was waxing red . and for his sins ' forgiveness a solemn prayer he said . low kneel'd that holy abbot while the dawn was waxing clear . and he pray'd with loving - kindness for his convent - brethren dear . low kneel'd that blessed abbot while the dawn was waxing bright . he pray'd a great prayer for ireland , he pray'd with all his might . low kneel'd that good old father while the sun began to dart . he pray'd a prayer for all men , he pray'd it from his heart . his blissful soul was in heaven , though a breathing man was he . he was out of time 's dominion , so far as the living may be .
