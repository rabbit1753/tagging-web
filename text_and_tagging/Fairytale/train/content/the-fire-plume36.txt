as he opened his eyes , in a dreamy way , he saw the kettle near him . some of the fish he observed were in the bowl . the fire flickered , and made light and shadow ; but nowhere was wassamo to be seen . he waited , and waited again , in the expectation that wassamo would appear . " perhaps , " thought the cousin , " he is gone out again to visit the nets . " he looked off that way , but the canoe still lay close by the rock at the shore . he searched and found his footsteps in the ashes , and out upon the green ground a little distance , and then they were utterly lost . he was now greatly troubled in spirit , and he called aloud , " netawis ! cousin ! cousin ! " but there was no answer to his call . he called again in his sorrow , louder and louder , " netawis ! netawis ! cousin ! cousin ! whither are you gone ? " but no answer came to his voice of wailing . he started for the edge of the woods , crying as he ran , " my cousin ! " and " oh , my cousin ! " hither and thither through the forest he sped with all his fleetness of foot and quickness of spirit ; and when at last he found that no voice would answer him , he burst into tears , and sobbed aloud .
