this was the lamp 's last night in the street , and to - morrow it must go to the town hall -- two very dark things to think of . no wonder it did not burn brightly . how many persons it had lighted on their way , and how much it had seen ! as much , very likely , as the mayor and corporation themselves ! none of these thoughts were uttered aloud , however , for the lamp was good and honorable and would not willingly do harm to any one , especially to those in authority . as one thing after another was recalled to its mind , the light would flash up with sudden brightness . at such moments the lamp had a conviction that it would be remembered .
