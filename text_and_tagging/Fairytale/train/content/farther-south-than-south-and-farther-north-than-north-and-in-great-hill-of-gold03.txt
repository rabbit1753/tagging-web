once upon a time there was a peasant who had a wheat - field , which was trampled down every saturday night . now the peasant had three sons , and he told each one of them to spend a saturday night in the field , and to watch and see who trampled it down . the oldest was to make the first trial . so he lay down by the upper ridge of the field , and after he had lain there a while he fell asleep . the following morning the whole field had been trampled down , and the young fellow was unable to tell how it had happened . now the second son was to make the attempt ; but he had the same experience . after he had lain a while he fell asleep , and in the morning he was unable to tell how the field had come to be trampled down . now it was the turn of john by the ashes . he did not lie down by the upper ridge of the field ; but lower down , and stayed awake . after he had lain there a while , three doves came flying along . they settled in the field , and that very moment shook off all their feathers , and turned into the most beautiful maidens one might wish to see . they danced with each other over the whole field ; and while they did so , the young fellow gathered up all their feathers . toward morning they wanted to put on their feathers again , but could not find them anywhere . then they were frightened , and wept and searched and searched and wept .
