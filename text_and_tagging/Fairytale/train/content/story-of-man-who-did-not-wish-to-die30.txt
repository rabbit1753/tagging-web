sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe - fish was served up in restaurants as a delectable dish , and hawkers in the streets went about selling sauces made of spanish flies . he never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things , nor did he ever see any one with as much as a cold . sentaro was delighted . he said to himself that he would never grow tired of living , and that he considered it profane to wish for death . he was the only happy man on the island . for his part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life . he set himself up in business , and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land .
