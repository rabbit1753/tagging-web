so when they had reached the gentleman 's house , and the peasant had given him the pig , he received in payment a rooster who would lay silver coins as often as he was told to do so . then the peasant went his way , well content with his bargain . but on the way home he stayed overnight at a tavern kept by an old woman . and he was so exceedingly happy about his splendid rooster , that he had to boast about him to the old woman , and show her how he went about laying silver coins . and at night , when the peasant was fast asleep , the old woman came and took away his rooster , and put another in its place . no sooner did the peasant awake in the morning than he wanted to set his rooster to work . " lay quickly , rooster of mine ! lay big silver coins , my rooster ! " but the rooster could lay no silver coins at all , and only answered " kikeriki ! kikeriki ! kikeriki ! " then the peasant fell into a rage , wandered back to the devil 's place , complained about the rooster , and told how absolutely worthless he was . he was kindly received , and the same gentleman gave him a hand - mill . when he called out " mill grind ! " to it , it would grind as much meal as he wanted it to , and would not stop until he said : " mill , stop grinding ! " and the mill would grind out every kind of meal for which he asked . when the peasant awoke in the morning , he was in a great hurry to test his mill ; but he could not make it obey . " mill grind ! " he cried . but the mill stood still . then he said : " dear mill , grind wheat meal ! " but it had no effect . " then grind rye meal ! " he shouted ; but that did not help , either . " well , then , grind peas ! " but the mill did not seem to hear ; but stood as still as though it had never turned a single time in all its life . then the peasant took the road back to the devil 's place again , and at once hunted up the gentleman who had purchased his pig , and told him the mill would grind no more meal .
