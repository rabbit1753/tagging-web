the house in which she dwelt was small and neat , but dreary to behold , for there were no flowers near it -- no trees . by the door stood a bee - hive , which was very useful . there was also a little potato - field , very useful , and an earth bank , with sloe bushes upon it , which had done blossoming . it now bore fruit , sloes , that draw one 's mouth together if one tastes them before the frost has touched them .
