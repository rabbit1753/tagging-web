the dragon scolded and screamed . " there the old worm flounders about , " said notscha , " and does not care how hard he is beaten ! i will scratch off some of his scales . " and with these words he began to tear open the dragon 's festal garments , and rip off some of the scales beneath his left arm , so that the red blood dripped out . then the dragon could no longer stand the pain and begged for mercy . but first he had to promise notscha that he would not complain of him , before the latter would let him go . and then the dragon had to turn himself into a little green snake , which notscha put into his sleeve and took back home with him . but no sooner had he drawn the little snake from his sleeve than it assumed human shape . the dragon then swore that he would punish li dsing in a terrible manner , and disappeared in a flash of lightning .
