" hallo , there ! so you want to run away ! " called esben , and blew into one end of his whistle , and then they scattered the more quickly to all the ends of the earth . but when he had reached an old charcoal - pit , he blew into the other end of his whistle , and before he knew it the hares were back again , and standing in rank and file so he could review them , just like a regiment of soldiers on the drill - ground . " that is a splendid whistle ! " thought esben ; lay down on a sunny hillock , and fell asleep . the hares were left to their own devices , and played until evening . then he once more whistled them together , and took them along to the castle like a herd of sheep .
