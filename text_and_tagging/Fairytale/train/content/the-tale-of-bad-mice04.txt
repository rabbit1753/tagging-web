hunca munca tried every tin spoon in turn ; the fish was glued to the dish . then tom thumb lost his temper . he put the ham in the middle of the floor , and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel -- bang , bang , smash , smash ! the ham flew all into pieces , for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster ! then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of tom thumb and hunca munca . they broke up the pudding , the lobsters , the pears , and the oranges .
