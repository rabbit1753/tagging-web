once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond . " i trust that is not a rat , " said mr . jeremy fisher ; " i think i had better get away from here . " mr . jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way , and dropped in the bait . there was a bite almost directly ; the float gave a tremendous bobbit ! " a minnow ! a minnow ! i have him by the nose ! " cried mr . jeremy fisher , jerking up his rod . but what a horrible surprise ! instead of a smooth fat minnow , mr . jeremy landed little jack sharp the stickleback , covered with spines ! the stickleback floundered about the boat , pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath . then he jumped back into the water . and a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out , and laughed at mr . jeremy fisher .
