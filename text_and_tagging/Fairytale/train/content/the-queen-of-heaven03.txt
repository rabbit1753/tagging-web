in every ship that sails a picture of the queen of heaven hangs in the cabin , and three paper talismans are also kept on shipboard . on the first she is painted with crown and scepter , on the second as a maiden in ordinary dress , and on the third she is pictured with flowing hair , barefoot , standing with a sword in her hand . when the ship is in danger the first talisman is burnt , and help comes . but if this is of no avail , then the second and finally the third picture is burned . and if no help comes then there is nothing more to be done .
