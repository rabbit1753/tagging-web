it rested on the loftiest cliffs of the island , and there they fixed their residence . they all resumed their natural shapes , but they were diminished to the size of fairies ; and as a mark of homage to the king of the evening star , they never failed on every pleasant evening during the summer season to join hands and dance upon the top of the rocks . these rocks were quickly observed by the indians to be covered , in moonlight evenings , with a larger sort of ininees , or little men , and were called mish - in - e - mok - in - ok - ong , or little spirits , and the island is named from them to this day . their shining lodge can be seen in the summer evenings , when the moon beams strongly on the pinnacles of the rocks ; and the fishermen who go near those high cliffs at night , have even heard the voices of the happy little dancers . and osseo and his wife , as fondly attached to each other as ever , always lead the dance .
