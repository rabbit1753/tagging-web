" this deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy ! " said the prince , looking round on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled in towards him on every side . " what a fool i was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast ! " and he ground his teeth with rage as he thought of the governor 's smiling treachery . dangerous as was his situation now , the prince was not in the least confounded . in his dire extremity he remembered the gifts his aunt had given him when they parted , and it seemed to him as if she must , with prophetic foresight , have divined this hour of need . he coolly opened the flint - bag that his aunt had given him and set fire to the grass near him . then drawing the sword of murakumo from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of him with all speed . he determined to die , if that were necessary , fighting for his life and not standing still waiting for death to come to him .
