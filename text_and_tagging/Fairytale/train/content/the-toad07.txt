" it 's much nicer here than down in the well ! i should like to stay here my whole life long ! " said the little toad . so she lay there for an hour , yes , for two hours . " i wonder what is to be found up here ? as i have come so far , i must try to go still farther . " and so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl . she got out upon the highway , where the sun shone upon her , and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way . " i 've got to a dry place now , and no mistake , " said the toad . " it 's almost too much of a good thing here ; it tickles one so . "
