" hush , " said the old woman , raising her head . " what noise is that at the door ? " " oh , " said her daughter , who was feeling rather frightened , " it 's only a yellow paddock . " " poor bit beastie , " said the kind - hearted old mother . " open the door and let him in . it 's cold work sitting on the doorstep . " so the lassie , very unwillingly opened the door , and the paddock came jump - jump - jumping across the kitchen , and sat down at the fireside .
