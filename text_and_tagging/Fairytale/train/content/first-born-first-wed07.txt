the prince at once replied : " take the hands - they are lying under the bed - and the bottle hanging in the window , and pour some of the contents of the bottle on their arms and hands , join them together , bind them up , take away the bandages in three days ' time and the hands will have been healed ! " the maiden made no reply and fell asleep . in the morning the prince rose as usual , stepped over to the bed several times and looked at her from its foot ; but she did not dare look up , and closed her eyes . he sighed , took his apple ; but left the bottle , and went . when the maiden rose she did as he had told her , and in three days ' time removed the bandages , and the girls ' hands were well and whole .
