" this is a wonderful place , " said the goblin ; " i never expected such a thing . i should like to stay here with the student . " then the little man thought it over , for he was a sensible sprite . at last he sighed , " but the student has no jam ! " so he went downstairs again to the huckster 's shop , and it was a good thing he got back when he did , for the cask had almost worn out the lady 's tongue . he had given a description of all that he contained on one side , and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there , when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady . from that time forward , the whole shop , from the cash - box down to the pine - wood logs , formed their opinions from that of the cask . they all had such confidence in him and treated him with so much respect that when , in the evening , the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art , they fancied it must all come from the cask .
