and after they had taken counsel together they summoned a trusty knight , and appointed him the prince 's ambassador ; and told him to take the slipper , and mount a fleet - footed horse , and ride up and down the whole of the kingdom until he found a lady whom it would fit . so the ambassador put the little shoe carefully in his pocket and set out on his errand . he rode , and he rode , and he rode , going to every town and castle that came in his way , and summoning all the ladies to appear before him to try on the shoe . and , as he caused a proclamation to be made that whoever could wear it should be the prince 's bride , i need not tell you that all the ladies in the country - side flocked to wherever the ambassador chanced to be staying , and begged leave to try on the slipper .
