maidwa was borne gently along but a little way above their heads ; and as they followed him , the rush and hum of the people was like the dead beating of the surges upon a lake shore after a storm . but the good wind gaining strength , soon carried him beyond their pursuit . a little further on he changed himself into a hawk , and flew swiftly off with his trophy , crying , " ka - kak ! ka - kak ! " till it resounded with its shrill tone through the whole country , far and wide . meanwhile the magician had remembered the instructions of maidwa , placing his head outside of the lodge as soon as he heard the ka - kak cry of the hawk . in a moment maidwa came past with rustling wings , and as he flew by , giving the magician a severe blow on the head with the wampum scalp , his limbs extended and quivered in an agony , the scalp adhered , and maidwa , in his own person , walked into the lodge and sat down , feeling perfectly at home . the magician was so long in recovering from the stunning blow which had been dealt him , that maidwa feared that in restoring the crown of his head he had destroyed his life . presently , however , he was pleased to see him show , by the motion of his hands and limbs , that his strength was returning ; and in a little while he rose and stood upon his feet . what was the delight of maidwa to behold , instead of a withered old man , far advanced in years and stricken in sorrow , a bright and cheerful youth , who glittered with life as he stood up before him .
