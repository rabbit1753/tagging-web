at this point , old mrs . rabbit 's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole calling--"cotton - tail ! cotton - tail ! fetch some more camomile ! " peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk . they went away hand in hand , and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood . from here they looked down into mr . mcgregor 's garden . peter 's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow , topped with an old tam - o - shanter of mr . mcgregor 's . little benjamin said , " it spoils people 's clothes to squeeze under a gate ; the proper way to get in , is to climb down a pear tree . " peter fell down head first ; but it was of no consequence , as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft . it had been sown with lettuces .
