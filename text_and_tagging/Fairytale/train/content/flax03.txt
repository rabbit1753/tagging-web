well , one day some people came , who took hold of the flax and pulled it up by the roots , which was very painful . then it was laid in water , as if it were to be drowned , and after that placed near a fire , as if it were to be roasted . all this was very shocking . " we can not expect to be happy always , " said the flax . " by experiencing evil as well as good we become wise . " and certainly there was plenty of evil in store for the flax . it was steeped , and roasted , and broken , and combed . indeed , it scarcely knew what was done to it . at last it was put on the spinning wheel . " whir , whir , " went the wheel , so quickly that the flax could not collect its thoughts . " well , i have been very happy , " it thought in the midst of its pain , " and must be contented with the past . " and contented it remained , till it was put on the loom and became a beautiful piece of white linen . all the flax , even to the last stalk , was used in making this one piece .
