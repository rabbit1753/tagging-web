thus some time passed . the princess dwelt in the beautiful castle , and had everything her heart might desire . but every day the dog ran off , and did not reappear until it was evening and the sun had set . then he returned home , and was always so kind and friendly that it would have been a fine thing had other men done half as well . the princess now began to feel a great affection for him , and quite forgot he was only a lame dog ; for the proverb says : " love is blind . " yet time passed slowly because she was so much alone , and she often thought of visiting her sisters and seeing how they were . she spoke of it to her husband , and begged his permission to make the journey . no sooner had the dog heard her wish than he at once granted it , and even accompanied her some distance , in order to show her the way out of the wood .
