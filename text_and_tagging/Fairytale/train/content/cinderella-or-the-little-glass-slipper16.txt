the next day the two sisters were at the ball , and so was cinderella , but dressed more magnificently than before . the king 's son was always by her , and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her ; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her ; so that she , at last , counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven ; she then rose up and fled , as nimble as a deer . the prince followed , but could not overtake her . she left behind one of her glass slippers , which the prince took up most carefully . she got home but quite out of breath , and in her nasty old clothes , having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers , fellow to that she dropped . the guards at the palace gate were asked : if they had not seen a princess go out . who said : they had seen nobody go out but a young girl , very meanly dressed , and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman . when the two sisters returned from the ball cinderella asked them : if they had been well diverted , and if the fine lady had been there . they told her : yes , but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve , and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers , the prettiest in the world , which the king 's son had taken up ; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball , and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper .
