when the people had all passed by , the youth went to the oak in which the queen crane dwelt . here he was given a black steed , a suit of brazen armor , and a silver sword . thus he rode to battle and got there as quickly as he could wish . then he said : " god aid me , and queen crane stay by me , and i will succeed ! " with that he killed all the enemy and rode away again . but the king thought that an angel had come to help him , and wanted to hold him back . the youth , however , rode quickly back to the oak , took off his armor , went down to the swamp , and once more began to click to his horse . when the people rode by they laughed and said : " you were not along to - day , so you missed seeing how an angel came and killed all the enemy . " and the youth pretended to feel sad , so sad .
