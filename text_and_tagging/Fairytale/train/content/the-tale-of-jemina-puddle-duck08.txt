jemima puddle - duck went up the cart - road for the last time , on a sunny afternoon . she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag . she flew over the wood , and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long - tailed gentleman . he was sitting on a log ; he sniffed the air , and kept glancing uneasily round the wood . when jemima alighted he quite jumped . " come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs . give me the herbs for the omelette . be sharp ! " he was rather abrupt . jemima puddle - duck had never heard him speak like that . she felt surprised , and uncomfortable . while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed . some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door , and then locked it . jemima became much alarmed .
