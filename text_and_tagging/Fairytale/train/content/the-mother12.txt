" another mother ! " said the poor woman , and directly let go her hold of both the flowers . " there , thou hast thine eyes , " said death ; " i fished them up from the lake , they shone so bright ; i knew not they were thine . take them again , they are now brighter than before ; now look down into the deep well close by ; i shall tell thee the names of the two flowers thou wouldst have torn up , and thou wilt see their whole future life -- their whole human existence : and see what thou wast about to disturb and destroy . " and she looked down into the well ; and it was a happiness to see how the one became a blessing to the world , to see how much happiness and joy were felt everywhere . and she saw the other 's life , and it was sorrow and distress , horror , and wretchedness . " both of them are god 's will ! " said death . " which of them is misfortune 's flower and which is that of happiness ? " asked she . " that i will not tell thee , " said death ; " but this thou shalt know from me , that the one flower was thy own child ! it was thy child 's fate thou saw'st -- thy own child 's future life ! "
