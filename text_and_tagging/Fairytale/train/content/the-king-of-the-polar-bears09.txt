then the king gave way to wrath . he advanced upon them with deep growls and stately tread and with one blow of his monstrous paw stretched the mocker lifeless at his feet . the other ran away to his fellows and carried the news of the king 's strange appearance . the result was a meeting of all the polar bears upon a broad field of ice , where they talked gravely of the remarkable change that had come upon their monarch . " he is , in reality , no longer a bear , " said one ; " nor can he justly be called a bird . but he is half bird and half bear , and so unfitted to remain our king . " " then who shall take his place ? " asked another . " he who can fight the bird - bear and overcome him , " answered an aged member of the group . " only the strongest is fit to rule our race . " there was silence for a time , but at length a great bear moved to the front and said : " i will fight him ; i - woof - the strongest of our race ! and i will be king of the polar bears . "
