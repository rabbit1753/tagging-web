once upon a time , in the city of shansi , there lived a scholar who found the company of others too noisy for him . so he made his home in a buddhist temple . yet he suffered because there were always so many gnats and fleas in his room that he could not sleep at night . once he was resting on his bed after dinner , when suddenly two little knights with plumes in their helmets rode into the room . they might have been two inches high , and rode horses about the size of grasshoppers . on their gauntleted hands they held hunting falcons as large as flies . they rode about the room with great rapidity . the scholar had no more than set eyes on them when a third entered , clad like the others , but carrying a bow and arrows and leading a little hunting dog the size of an ant with him . after him came a great throng of footmen and horsemen , several hundred in all . and they had hunting falcons and hunting dogs by the hundred , too . then the fleas and gnats began to rise in the air ; but were all slain by the falcons . and the hunting dogs climbed on the bed , and sniffed along the walls trailing the fleas , and ate them up . they followed the trace of whatever hid in the cracks , and nosed it out , so that in a short space of time they had killed nearly all the vermin .
