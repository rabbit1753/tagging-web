now a long time passed , and the king 's daughters grew up and became the most beautiful maidens of whom one has ever heard tell . then war broke out and the king , their father , had to leave them . one day , while he was away at war , the three princesses were sitting in the window and looking out , watching the sun shine on the little flowers in the garden . and they felt a great desire to play with the lovely flowers , and begged their guards to let them go into the garden for a little while . but this their guards would not allow , for they feared the king 's anger . yet the king 's daughters pleaded so very sweetly that they could not deny their pleas and they let them have their way . but the princesses did not have long to walk about , for no sooner were they beneath the open sky , than a cloud came suddenly down , and bore them off , and all attempts to regain possession of them were fruitless ; though search was made in every direction .
