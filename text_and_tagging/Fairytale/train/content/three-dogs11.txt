yet before he went he said : " you will be satisfied with your exchange , for this dog is not like other dogs . his name is ' hark ! ' and his hearing is so keen that he hears everything that happens , though it be happening many miles away . he even hears the grass and the trees grow . " then they parted in the friendliest spirit . but the youth was happy in the thought that now he need fear nothing in the world . and then , when evening came on , and the swine - herd went home , his mother was very sad to think that her son had sold all they possessed . but the youth told her to be of good courage , since he would see to it that they did not suffer want . and when he spoke to her in such a cheerful manner , she grew content again , and decided that he had spoken in wise and manly fashion . then when day dawned the youth went hunting with his dogs , and came back at evening with as much game as he could possibly carry . and he continued to go hunting in this way for a time until his old mother 's store - room was well provided with meat and all sorts of good things . then he bade his mother a fond farewell , called his dogs , and said he was going to wander out into the world and try his fortune .
