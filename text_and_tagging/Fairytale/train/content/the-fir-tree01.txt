there was once a pretty little fir - tree in a wood . it was in a capital position , for it could get sun , and there was enough air , and all around grew many tall companions , both pines and firs . it did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air , or notice the little peasant children who ran about chattering when they came out to gather wild strawberries and raspberries . often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw ; they would sit down by the little fir - tree and say , ' what a pretty little one this is ! ' the tree did not like that at all . by the next year it had grown a whole ring taller , and the year after that another ring more , for you can always tell a fir - tree 's age from its rings .
