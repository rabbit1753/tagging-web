the lady did not stop to get any drop of the water on herself , but ran quickly from the castle . when she came to the spring she roused lawn dyarrig . if she found him lying , she left him standing . she smothered him with kisses , drowned him with tears , dried him with garments of fine silk and with her own hair . herself and himself locked arms and walked into the castle of the green knight . after that they were inviting each other with the best food and entertainment till the middle of the following day . then the lady said : " when the green knight bore me away from my father and mother he brought me straight to this castle , but i put him under bonds not to marry me for seven years and a day , and he can not ; still , i must serve him . when he goes fowling he spends three days away and the next three days at home . this is the day for him to come back , and for me to prepare his dinner . there is no stir that you or i have made here to - day but that brass head beyond there will tell of it .
