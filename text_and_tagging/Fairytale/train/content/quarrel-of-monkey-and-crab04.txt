now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found . the persimmon - seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone . he , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange . the crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone - like seed , and would not consent to the monkey 's proposition .
