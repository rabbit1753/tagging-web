he consented to go with the crab to pick the fruit for him . when they both reached the spot , the monkey was astonished to see what a fine tree had sprung from the seed , and with what a number of ripe persimmons the branches were loaded . he quickly climbed the tree and began to pluck and eat , as fast as he could , one persimmon after another . each time he chose the best and ripest he could find , and went on eating till he could eat no more . not one would he give to the poor hungry crab waiting below , and when he had finished there was little but the hard , unripe fruit left .
