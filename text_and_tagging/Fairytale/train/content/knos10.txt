the princess stood on the sea - shore and wept and wrung her hands ; for she could see what she had to expect . nor did she have much confidence in red peter , who sat on a willow - stump , with a rusty old sabre in his hand . then knos came and tried to comfort the princess as well as he knew how , and asked her whether she would comb his hair . yes , he might lay his head in her lap , and she combed his hair . suddenly there was a dreadful roaring out at sea . it was the troll who was coming along , and he had five heads . red peter was so frightened that he rolled off his willow - stump . " knos , is that you ? " cried the troll . " yes , " said knos . " haul me up on the shore ! " said the troll . " pay out the cable ! " said knos . then he hauled the troll ashore ; but he had his sword of five hundredweights at his side , and with it he chopped off all five of the troll 's heads , and the princess was free . but when knos had gone off , red peter put his sabre to the breast of the princess , and told her he would kill her unless she said he was her deliverer . then came the turn of the second princess . once more red peter sat on the willow - stump with his rusty sabre , and knos asking to be let off for the day , went to the sea - shore and begged the princess to comb his hair , which she did . then along came the troll , and this time he had ten heads . " knos , is that you ? " asked the troll . " yes , " said knos . " haul me ashore ! " said the troll . " pay out the cable ! " said knos . and this time knos had his sword of ten hundredweights at his side , and he cut off all ten of the troll 's heads . and so the second princess was freed . but red peter held his sabre at the princess ' breast , and forced her to say that he had delivered her .
