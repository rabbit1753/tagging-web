" this is where your parents live , " said the white bear . " only do not forget what i told you , or you will make us both unhappy . " heaven forbid that she should forget it , said the maiden . when she had come to the house , she got down , and the bear turned back . when the daughter entered her parents ' home , they were more than happy . they told her that they could not thank her enough for what she had done , and that now all of them were doing splendidly . then they asked her how she herself fared . the maiden answered that all was well with her , also , and that she had all that heart could desire .
