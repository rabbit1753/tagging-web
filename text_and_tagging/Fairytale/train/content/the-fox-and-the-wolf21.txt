but the wolf had seen the fox beginning to grow greasy , and he knew now what had happened , and he determined to have his revenge . so he waited until they came to a smithy which stood at the side of the road , where a horse was waiting just outside the door to be shod . then , keeping at a safe distance , he said to his companion , " there is writing on that smithy door , which i can not read , as my eyes are failing ; do thou try to read it , for perchance it may be something it were good for us to know . " and the silly fox , who was very vain , and did not like to confess that his eyes were no better than those of his friend , went close up to the door to try and read the writing . and he chanced to touch the horse 's fetlock , and , it being a restive beast , lifted its foot and struck out at once , and killed the fox as dead as a door - nail . and so , you see , the old saying in the good book came true after all : " be sure your sin will find you out .
