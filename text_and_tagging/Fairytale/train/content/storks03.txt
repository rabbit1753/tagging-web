" only listen , " said the young storks , " to what the boys are singing . do you hear them say we 're to be hanged and shot ? " " do n't listen to what they say ; if you do n't mind , it wo n't hurt you , " said the mother . but the boys went on singing , and pointed mockingly at the sentinel stork . only one boy , whom they called peter , said it was a shame to make game of animals , and he would not join in the singing at all . the mother stork tried to comfort her young ones . " do n't mind them , " she said ; " see how quiet your father stands on one leg there . " " but we are afraid , " said the little ones , drawing back their beaks into the nest .
