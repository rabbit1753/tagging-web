a little later he met two young fellows who were quarreling over an old fiddle , which had been left them . " now is that worth while doing ? " said the young fellow . " i have a brand - new fiddle at home . " " but i doubt if it has such a tone as ours , " said one of the youths , " for if some one is dead , and you play this fiddle , he will come to life again . " " that really is a good deal , " said the young fellow . " may i draw the bow across the strings ? " they told him he might , but no sooner did he have the fiddle in his hand than he took a step , and suddenly he was a thousand miles away .
