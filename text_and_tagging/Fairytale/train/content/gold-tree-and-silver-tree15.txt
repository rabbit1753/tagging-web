" " by my truth , you are not , " answered the trout , in his very straightforward way . " who is the most beautiful woman , then ? " asked the queen , her face growing pale at the thought that she had yet another rival . " why , your majesty 's step - daughter , the princess gold - tree , to be sure , " answered the trout . the queen threw back her head with a sigh of relief . " well , at any rate , people can not admire her now , " she said . " it is a year since she died . i ate her heart for my supper . " " are you sure of that , your majesty ? " asked the trout , with a twinkle in his eye . " it seems to me it is but a year since she married the gallant young prince who came from abroad to seek her hand . she returned with him to his own country . "
