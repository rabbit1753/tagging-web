the father coming in the evening to visit the lodge of his daughters , discovered what had happened . he immediately sent word to his son that his sisters had been slain , and that there were no more spoils to be had , which greatly inflamed the young man 's temper , especially the woeful announcement at the close . " the person who has done this , " said the brother , as soon as he had reached the spot , chafing and half beside himself at the gloomy prospect of having no more travelers to strip , " must be that boy who carries the ball on his back . i know his mode of going about his business , and since he would not allow himself to be killed by my sisters , he shall have the honor of dying by my hand . i will pursue him and have revenge . " " it is well , my son , " replied the father ; " the spirit of your life grant you success . i counsel you to be wary in the pursuit . bahmondang is a cunning youth . it is a strong spirit who has put him on to do this injury to us , and he will try to deceive you in every way . above all , avoid tasting food till you succeed ; for if you break your fast before you see his blood , your power will be destroyed .
