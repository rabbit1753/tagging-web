well , the child i rubbed , sure enough ; but my right eye began to smart , and i put up my finger and gave it a rub , and then stared , for never in all my life was i so frightened . the beautiful room was a big , rough cave , with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the clay ; and the lady , and the lord , and the child weazened , poverty - bitten creatures -- nothing but skin and bone -- and the rich dresses were old rags . i did n't let on that i found any difference , and after a bit says the dark man , " go before me to the hall door , and i will be with you in a few moments , and see you safe home . " well , just as i turned into the outside cave , who should i see watching near the door but poor molly . she looked round all terrified , and says she to me in a whisper , " i 'm brought here to nurse the child of the king and queen of the fairies ; but there is one chance of saving me . all the court will pass the cross near templeshambo next friday night , on a visit to the fairies of old ross . if john can catch me by the hand or cloak when i ride by , and has courage not to let go his grip , i 'll be safe . here 's the king . do n't open your mouth to answer . i saw what happened with the ointment .
