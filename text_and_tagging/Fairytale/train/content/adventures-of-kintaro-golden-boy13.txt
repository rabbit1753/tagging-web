" there , " said kintaro , " what do you think of my bridge ? it is quite safe , so follow me , " and he stepped across first . the four animals followed . never had they seen any one so strong before , and they all exclaimed : " how strong he is ! how strong he is ! " while all this was going on by the river a woodcutter , who happened to be standing on a rock overlooking the stream , had seen all that passed beneath him . he watched with great surprise kintaro and his animal companions . he rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge .
