in a church - nave a specter sat night by night , and the specter 's name was torre jeppe . he was a dried - up corpse that could not decay . one night three tailors were working at a farmstead in the neighborhood . they were laughing and joking , and among other things they asked the girl in the house , who was known to be brave , what they would have to give her to go to church and fetch back torre jeppe . she could trust herself to do it , was her answer ; but they must give her a dress of home - spun wool for her trouble . that she should surely have , said the tailors , for they did not believe the girl would dare such a venture . yet she took the tailors at their word and really went .
