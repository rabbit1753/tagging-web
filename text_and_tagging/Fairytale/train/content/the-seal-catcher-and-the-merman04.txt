but the seal catcher only laughed at them , and said that those seals were most worth killing . their skins were so big that he got an extra price for them . now it chanced one day , when he was pursuing his calling , that he stabbed a seal with his hunting - knife . whether the stroke had not been sure enough or not , i can not say , but with a loud cry of pain the creature slipped off the rock into the sea , and disappeared under the water , carrying the knife along with it . the seal catcher , much annoyed at his clumsiness , and also at the loss of his knife , went home to dinner in a very downcast frame of mind . on his way he met a horseman , who was so tall and so strange - looking and who rode on such a gigantic horse , that he stopped and looked at him in astonishment . he wondered who he was , and from what country he came .
