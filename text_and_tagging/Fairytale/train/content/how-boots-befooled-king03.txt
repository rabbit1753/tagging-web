oh ! he would only like to have a try at befooling the king . very good ; he should have his try . he was not the first one who had been there that morning , early as it was . so peter was shown in to the king . " oh , look ! " said he , " yonder are three black geese out in the court - yard " but no , the king was not to be fooled so easily as all that . " one goose is enough to look at at a time , " said he ; " take him away and give him a whipping ! " and so they did , and peter went home bleating like a sheep . one day paul spoke up . " i should like to go and have a try for the princess , too , " said he . well , his father did not say no , for , after all , paul was the more clever of the two . so off paul went as merrily as a duck in the rain . by and by he came to the castle , and then he too was brought before the king just as peter had been . " oh , look ! " said he , " yonder is a crow sitting in the tree with three white stripes on his back ! "
