when he heard this kilweh felt proud and happy . surely he must be a man now , he thought , or there would be no talk of a wife for him , and his mind dwelt all day upon his promised bride , and what she would be like when he beheld her . ' what troubles you , my son ? ' asked his father at last , when kilweh had forgotten something he had been bidden to do , and kilweh blushed red as he answered : ' my stepmother says that none but olwen , the daughter of yspaddaden penkawr , shall be my wife . ' ' that will be easily fulfilled , ' replied his father . ' arthur the king is your cousin . go therefore to him and beg him to cut your hair , and to grant you this boon . '
