but lisa took a raspberry leaf , swept the worm carefully on to the leaf and carried it out into the yard . then aina noticed that a sparrow sitting on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm , so she took up the leaf , carried it out into the wood and hid it under a raspberry bush where the greedy sparrow could not find it . yes , and what more is there to tell about a raspberry worm ? who would give three straws for such a miserable little thing ? yes , but who would not like to live in such a pretty home as it lives in ; in such a fresh fragrant dark - red cottage , far away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves !
