once upon a time there was a youth called moti , who was very big and strong , but the clumsiest creature you can imagine . so clumsy was he that he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk or curds which his mother set out on the floor to cool , always smashing , upsetting , breaking , until at last his father said to him : ' here , moti , are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years ; take them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can . ' then moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over his shoulder , singing gaily to himself as he walked along . in one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when he came to a certain city where he entered the travellers ' ' serai ' or inn to pass the night . now a serai , you must know , is generally just a large square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the inside all round to accommodate both men and beasts , and with perhaps a few rooms in towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too proud to care about sleeping by their own camels and horses . moti , of course , was a country lad and had lived with cattle all his life , and he was n't rich and he was n't proud , so he just borrowed a bed from the innkeeper , set it down beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home , and in five minutes was fast asleep .
