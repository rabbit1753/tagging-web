there was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing . they had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot . this son 's name was uraschimataro , which means in japanese , ' son of the island , ' and he was a fine well - grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather . not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ' if your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . ' but uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him .
