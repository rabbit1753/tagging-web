it was now late , and maisie lost no time in running home with the precious thread upon her shoulder . when she walked into the kitchen she found that her mother had gone to bed . she seemed to have had a busy day , for there , hanging up in the wide chimney , in order to dry , were seven large black puddings . the fire was low , but bright and clear ; and the sight of it and the sight of the puddings suggested to maisie that she was very hungry , and that fried black puddings were very good . flinging the thread down on the table , she hastily pulled off her shoes , so as not to make a noise and awake her mother ; and , getting down the frying - pan from the wall , she took one of the black puddings from the chimney , and fried it , and ate it . still she felt hungry , so she took another , and then another , till they were all gone . then she crept upstairs to her little bed and fell fast asleep . next morning her mother came downstairs before maisie was awake . in fact , she had not been able to sleep much for thinking of her daughter 's careless ways , and had been sorrowfully making up her mind that she must lose no time in speaking to the abbess of st . mary 's about this idle girl of hers . what was her surprise to see on the table the seven beautiful hanks of thread , while , on going to the chimney to take down a black pudding to fry for breakfast , she found that every one of them had been eaten . she did not know whether to laugh for joy that her daughter had been so industrious , or to cry for vexation because all her lovely black puddings -- which she had expected would last for a week at least -- were gone . in her bewilderment she sang out : " my daughter 's spun se'en , se'en , se'en , my daughter 's eaten se'en , se'en , se'en , and all before daylight .
