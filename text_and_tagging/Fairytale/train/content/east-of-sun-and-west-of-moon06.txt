yet when she had lain down and put out the light , she saw a man come in and cast himself down in a corner . it was the white bear , who was allowed to throw off his fur at night . the maiden never actually saw him , for he never came until she had put out the light . before dawn brightened he had disappeared again . for a time all went well ; but gradually the maiden grew sad and silent . she had not a soul to keep her company the live - long day , and she felt very homesick for her parents and sisters . when the white bear asked her what troubled her , she told him she was always alone , and that she wanted so very much to see her parents and sisters again . she felt very sad because she could not do so . " o that can be managed , " said the white bear . " but first you must promise me that you will never speak to your mother alone ; but only when others are present . very likely she will take you by the hand , and want to lead you into her room , so that she can speak to you alone . but this you must not allow , otherwise you will make us both unhappy .
