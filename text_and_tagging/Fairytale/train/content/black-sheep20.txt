" i am getting along finely , " the black sheep would answer , " for not one sheep in the pasture has so much wool as i have grown already . " " can i do anything to help you ? " asked the little boy . " not that i think of , " replied the sheep , " unless you could get me a little salt . i believe salt helps the wool to grow . " so the boy ran to the house and begged his mother for a handful of salt , and then he came back to the bars , where the black sheep licked it out of his hand . day by day the wool on the sheep grew longer and longer , and even the old ram noticed it and said , " you are foolish to grow so much wool , for the farmer will cut it all off , and it will do you no good . now i am growing just as little as possible , for since he steals what i have i am determined he shall get very little wool from my back .
