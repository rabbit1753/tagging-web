the next day the magician again commanded prince milan to be led before him . his daughters were all arranged in a straight row in front of him , dressed exactly alike , and with their eyes bent on the ground . ' now , you genius , ' said the magician , ' look at these beauties three times , and then tell us which is the princess hyacinthia . ' prince milan went past them and looked at them closely . but they were all so precisely alike that they looked like one face reflected in thirty mirrors , and the fly was nowhere to be seen ; the second time he passed them he still saw nothing ; but the third time he perceived a little fly stealing down one cheek , causing it to blush a faint pink . then the prince seized the girl 's hand and cried out , ' this is the princess hyacinthia ! ' ' you 're right again , ' said the magician in amazement ; ' but i 've still another task for you to do . before this candle , which i shall light , burns to the socket , you must have made me a pair of boots reaching to my knees . if they are n't finished in that time , off comes your head .
