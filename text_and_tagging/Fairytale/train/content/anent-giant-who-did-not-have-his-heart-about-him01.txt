once upon a time there was a king who had seven sons . he was so fond of them that he never could bear to have them all away from him at once . one of them always had to stay with him . when they had grown up , six of them were to go forth and look for wives . the youngest the king wanted to keep at home , and the others were to bring along a bride for him . the king gave the six the handsomest clothes that had ever been seen , clothes that glittered from afar . each received a horse that had cost many hundred dollars , and so they set forth . and after they had been at the courts of many kings , and had seen many princesses , they at last came to a king who had six daughters . such beautiful princesses they had not as yet met with . each of them paid court to one of them , and when each had won his sweetheart , they rode back home again . but they were so deeply in love with their brides that they altogether forgot they were also to bring back a princess for their young brother who had stayed at home .
