the duke greeted the king pleasantly , and the king returned his greeting in the same way , and discussing their affairs together they became good friends . there was a great banquet , and the duke sat beside the princess at the table . what they said to each other i do not know , but the duke knew so well how to talk that , no matter what he said , the princess could not say no , and so he went to the king and begged for her hand . the king could not exactly refuse it , for the duke was the kind of a man whom it was better to have for a friend than for an enemy ; but he could not give his answer out of hand , either . first he wished to see the duke 's castle , and know how matters stood with regard to this , that and the other -- which was natural .
