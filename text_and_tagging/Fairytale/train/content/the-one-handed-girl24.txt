a great rage took possession of his soul as he thought of the girl whom he had tried to ruin being after all so much better off than himself , and he vowed that he would work her ill . therefore that very afternoon he made his way to the palace and asked to see the king . when he was admitted to his presence , he knelt down and touched the ground with his forehead , and the king bade him stand up and tell wherefore he had come . ' by the kindness of your heart have you been deceived , o king , ' said he . ' your son has married a girl who has lost a hand . do you know why she had lost it ? she was a witch , and has wedded three husbands , and each husband she has put to death with her arts . then the people of the town cut off her hand , and turned her into the forest . and what i say is true , for her town is my town also .
