one day as knos was going along , he met a man carrying a church on his back . " you are a strong man , you are ! " said knos . " no , i am not strong , " said he , " but knos at the king 's court , he is strong ; for he can take steel and iron , and weld them together with his hands as though they were clay . " " well , i 'm the man of whom you are speaking , " said knos , " come , let us travel together . " and so they wandered on . then they met a man who carried a mountain of stone on his back . " you are strong , you are ! " said knos . " no , i 'm not strong , " said the man with the mountain of stone , " but knos at the king 's court , he is strong ; for he can weld together steel and iron with his hands as though they were clay .
