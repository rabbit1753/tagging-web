once more the grey palfrey was brought , and thomas and the queen mounted it ; and , as they had come , so they returned to the eildon tree near the huntly burn . then the queen bade thomas farewell ; and , as a parting gift , he asked her to give him something that would let people know that he had really been to fairy - land . " i have already given thee the gift of truth , " she replied . " i will now give thee the gifts of prophecy and poesie ; so that thou wilt be able to foretell the future , and also to write wondrous verses . and , besides these unseen gifts , here is something that mortals can see with their own eyes -- a harp that was fashioned in fairy - land . fare thee well , my friend . some day , perchance , i will return for thee again . " with these words the lady vanished , and thomas was left alone , feeling a little sorry , if the truth must be told , at parting with such a radiant being and coming back to the ordinary haunts of men .
