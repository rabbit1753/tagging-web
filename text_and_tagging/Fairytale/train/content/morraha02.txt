and on the third morning morraha went to the brink of the sea , and he saw the young man coming . and he drew up his boat on the shore , and asked him would he play cards . and they played , and morraha won the game . the young man bade him give his claim . and he said he should have a castle , and of women the finest and fairest ; and they were his . it was well , and the young man went away . on the fourth day the woman asked him how he had found himself , and he told her . " and i am going out , " said he , " to play again to - day . " " i cross ( forbid ) you go again to him . if you have won so much , you will lose more . have no more to do with him . " but he went against her will , and he saw the currach coming , and the young man was driving his balls from end to end of the currach . he had balls of silver and a hurl of gold , and he stopped not till he drew his boat on the shore , and made her fast for a year and a day . and morraha and he saluted each other . he asked morraha if he would play a game of cards , and they played and he won . and morraha said to him , " give your claim , now . " said he , " you will hear it too soon . i lay on you the bonds of the art of the druid not to sleep two nights in one house , nor finish a second meal at the one table , till you bring me the sword of light and news of the death of anshgayliacht .
