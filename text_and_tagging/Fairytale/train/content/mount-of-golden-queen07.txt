but she replied : " that i do not know . go ask my sister , who is nine yards taller than i am , and who lives in an earth - mound which you can find without any trouble . " so he left her and came to a mound of earth that looked just like the first , and from which smoke was also rising . a woman at once came out who was tremendously tall , and of her he asked the way to the mount of the golden queen . " that i do not know , " said she . " go ask my brother , who is nine yards taller than i am , and who lives in a hill a little further away . " so he came to the hill , from which smoke was also rising , and knocked . a man at once came out who was a veritable giant , for he was twenty - seven yards in length , and of him he asked the way to the mount of the golden queen . then the giant took a whistle and whistled in every direction , to call together all the animals to be found on the earth . and all the animals came from the woods , notably among them a bear . the giant asked him about the mount of the golden queen , but he knew nothing of it . again the giant blew his whistle in every direction to call together all the fishes to be found in the waters . they came at once , and he asked them about the mount of the golden queen ; but they knew nothing of it . once more the giant blew his whistle in every direction , and called together all the birds of the air . they came , and he asked the eagle about the mount of the golden queen , and whether he knew where it might be . the eagle said : " yes ! " " well then , take this lad there , " said the giant " but do not treat him unkindly ! " this the eagle promised , allowed the youth to seat himself on his back , and then off they were through the air , over fields and forests , hill and dale . before long they were above the ocean , and could see nothing but sky and water .
