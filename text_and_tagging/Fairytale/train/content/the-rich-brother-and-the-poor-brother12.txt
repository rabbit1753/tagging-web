it was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face , and they looked at each other in silence . then tears rose in the eyes of the elder , but winking them hastily away , he said : ' brother , it is not needful that i should tell you how poor i am ; you can see that for yourself . i have not come to beg for money , but only to ask if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city , and i will make them watertight , so that my wife and children can live in them , and that will save our rent . for as they are , they profit you nothing . ' and the younger brother listened and pitied him , and gave him the houses that he asked for , and the elder went away happy .
