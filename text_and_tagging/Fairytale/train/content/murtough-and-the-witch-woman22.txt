they asked of her , " who art thou , maiden , and wherefore art thou come to the house of mourning ? for a king lies buried here . " " a king lies buried here , indeed , " said she , " and i it was who slew him , murtough of the many deeds , of the race of conn and niall , high king of ireland and of the west . and though it was i who wrought his death , i myself will die for grief of him . " and they said , " tell us , maiden , why you brought him to his death , if so be that he was dear to thee ? " and she said , " murtough was dear to me , indeed , dearest of the men of the whole world ; for i am sheen , the daughter of sige , the son of dian , from whom ath sigi or the ' ford of sige ' is called to - day . but murtough slew my father , and my mother and sister were slain along with him , in the battle of cerb upon the boyne , and there was none of my house to avenge their death , save myself alone .
