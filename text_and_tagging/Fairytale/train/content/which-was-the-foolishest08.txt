' i will try everything that is possible , ' said the wife , who did not in the least wish her husband to die , but was determined to show that he was more foolish that the other man . ' i will get some dried herbs and make you a drink , but i am very much afraid that it is too late . why did you not tell me before ? ' ' i thought perhaps the pain would go off in a day or two ; and , besides , i did not want to make you unhappy , ' answered the man , who was by this time quite sure he had been suffering tortures , and had borne them like a hero . ' of course , if i had had any idea how ill i really was , i should have spoken at once . ' ' well , well , i will see what can be done , ' said the wife , ' but talking is not good for you . lie still , and keep yourself warm . '
