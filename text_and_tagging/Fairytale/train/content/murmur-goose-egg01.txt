once upon a time there were five women who were standing in a field , mowing . heaven had not given a single one of them a child , and each of them wanted to have one . and suddenly they saw a goose - egg of quite unheard - of size , well - nigh as large as a man 's head . " i saw it first , " said the one . " i saw it at the same time that you did , " insisted another . " but i want it , for i saw it first of all , " maintained a third . and thus they went on , and fought so about the egg that they nearly came to blows . finally they agreed that it should belong to all five of them , and that all of them should sit on it , as a goose would do , and hatch out the little gosling . the first remained sitting on the egg for eight days , and hatched , and did not move or do a thing . during this time the rest had to feed her and themselves as well . one of them grew angry because of this and scolded .
