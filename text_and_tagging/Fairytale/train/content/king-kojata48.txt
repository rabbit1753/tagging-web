the cake was soon made . the invited guests were already thronging round the table , when the head cook entered the room , bearing a beautiful wedding cake on a silver dish , and laid it before prince milan . the guests were all lost in admiration , for the cake was quite a work of art . prince milan at once proceeded to cut it open , when to his surprise two white doves sprang out of it , and one of them said to the other : ' my dear mate , do not fly away and leave me , and forget me as prince milan forgot his beloved hyacinthia . ' milan sighed deeply when he heard what the little dove said . then he jumped up suddenly from the table and ran to the door , where he found the beautiful hyacinthia waiting for him . outside stood his faithful charger , pawing the ground . without pausing for a moment , milan and hyacinthia mounted him and galloped as fast as they could into the country of king kojata . the king and queen received them with such joy and gladness as had never been heard of before , and they all lived happily for the rest of their lives .
