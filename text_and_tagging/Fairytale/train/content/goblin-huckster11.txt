the goblin caught up the wonderful book , which lay on the table , and popped it into his red cap , which he held tightly with both hands . the greatest treasure in the house was saved , and he ran away with it to the roof and seated himself on the chimney . the flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat with both hands pressed tightly over his cap , in which the treasure lay . it was then that he understood what feelings were really strongest in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended . yet , when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect , he hesitated , and said at last , " i must divide myself between the two ; i can not quite give up the huckster , because of the jam . " this is a representation of human nature . we are like the goblin ; we all go to visit the huckster , " because of the jam . "
