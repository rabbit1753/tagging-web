hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him . the dishes were crystallized lotus leaves and flowers , and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony . as soon as they sat down , the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out , and behind them followed ten red - carp musicians with the koto and the samisen . thus the hours flew by till midnight , and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede . the dragon king was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken by a tramp , tramp ! as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away .
