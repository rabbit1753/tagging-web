" it will be running some risk , " answered the man , " but i will do it sooner than that you should come to grief . " and so , taking the cord in his hand , he drove the pig quickly along a by - path . lucky hans went on his way home with the goose under his arm . " the more i think of it , " said he to himself , " the better the bargain seems . first i get the roast goose , then the fat , that will last a whole year for bread and dripping . lastly the beautiful white feathers which i can stuff my pillow with . how comfortably i shall sleep upon it , and how pleased my mother will be ! " and when he reached the last village , he saw a knife - grinder with his barrow . his wheel went whirring round , and he sang , " my scissors i grind , and my wheel i turn . and all good fellows my trade should learn , for all that i meet with just serves my turn . " and hans stood and looked at him . at last he spoke to him and said , " you seem very well off , and merry with your grinding . "
