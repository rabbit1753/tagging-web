now it happened that the fairy of the beech - woods lived in the lovely valley to which chance had led the poor fugitives , and it was she who had , in pity for their forlorn condition , sent the king such good luck to his fishing , and generally taken them under her protection . this she was all the more inclined to do as she loved children , and little prince featherhead , who never cried and grew prettier day by day , quite won her heart . she made the acquaintance of the king and the queen without at first letting them know that she was a fairy , and they soon took a great fancy to her , and even trusted her with the precious prince , whom she carried off to her palace , where she regaled him with cakes and tarts and every other good thing . this was the way she chose of making him fond of her ; but afterwards , as he grew older , she spared no pains in educating and training him as a prince should be trained . but unfortunately , in spite of all her care , he grew so vain and frivolous that he quitted his peaceful country life in disgust , and rushed eagerly after all the foolish gaieties of the neighbouring town , where his handsome face and charming manners speedily made him popular . the king and queen deeply regretted this alteration in their son , but did not know how to mend matters , since the good old fairy had made him so self - willed .
