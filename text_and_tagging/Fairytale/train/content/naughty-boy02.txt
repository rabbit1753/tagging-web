" oh let me in ! let me in ! i am cold , and i 'm so wet ! " exclaimed suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance , while the rain poured down , and the wind made all the windows rattle . " poor thing ! " said the old poet , as he went to open the door . there stood a little boy , quite naked , and the water ran down from his long golden hair . he trembled with cold , and had he not come into a warm room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest .
