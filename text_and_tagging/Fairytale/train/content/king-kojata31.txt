' do n't worry or distress yourself , dear father , ' answered prince milan . ' things are never as bad as they look . only give me a horse for my journey , and i wager you 'll soon see me back again . ' the king gave him a beautiful charger , with golden stirrups , and a sword . the queen hung a little cross round his neck , and after much weeping and lamentation the prince bade them all farewell and set forth on his journey . he rode straight on for two days , and on the third he came to a lake as smooth as glass and as clear as crystal . not a breath of wind moved , not a leaf stirred , all was silent as the grave , only on the still bosom of the lake thirty ducks , with brilliant plumage , swam about in the water . not far from the shore prince milan noticed thirty little white garments lying on the grass , and dismounting from his horse , he crept down under the high bulrushes , took one of the garments and hid himself with it behind the bushes which grew round the lake . the ducks swam about all over the place , dived down into the depths and rose again and glided through the waves . at last , tired of disporting themselves , they swam to the shore , and twenty - nine of them put on their little white garments and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens . then they finished dressing and disappeared . only the thirtieth little duck could n't come to the land ; it swam about close to the shore , and , giving out a piercing cry , it stretched its neck up timidly , gazed wildly around , and then dived under again .
