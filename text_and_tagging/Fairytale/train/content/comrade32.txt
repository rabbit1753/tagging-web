on the following day the comrade said that now they must get on their way . the youth was ready to set forth , and the princess , too , for her dower had long since been made ready . during the night the comrade had brought all the gold and silver , and all the valuables which the troll had left in the hill to the castle . when they wanted to start in the morning , the castle court - yard was so full they could scarcely get through . the dower supplied by the troll was worth more than the king 's whole country , and they did not know how they were to take it home . but the comrade found a way out of the difficulty . the troll had also left six goats who could fly through the air . these he loaded so heavily with gold and silver that they had to walk on the ground , and were not strong enough to rise into the air . what the goats could not carry , had to be left at the castle . thus they traveled for a long time , but at last the goats grew so weary and wretched that they could go no further . the youth and the princess did not know what to do . when the comrade saw that they could not move from the spot , he took the whole treasure on his back , topped it with the goats , and carried it all until they were no more than half a mile from the youth 's home . then the comrade said : " now i must part from you , for i can stay with you no longer . " but the youth would not hear of parting , and would not let him go at any price .
