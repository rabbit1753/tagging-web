then they began to eat and drink ; but the girl left the hill and went home . the following day she again went to the wood to look for the cattle , did not find them , lost her way again , and came to the same hill . this time she also entered , and found everything as it had been the first time , the well - spread table and the bed with the snake in it . and the snake said to her , as before : " sit down , if you choose ! eat , if you choose ! come , and lie down in the bed if you choose ! but if you do not choose , then do not do so ! now a great many more people are coming who will want to dance with you , but do not go with them . " the snake had scarcely concluded before a great many people arrived , who began to dance , eat and drink ; but the girl did not keep them company , instead she left the hill and went home .
