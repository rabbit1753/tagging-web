" when will he be here ? " says she . " to - morrow , about two o'clock , " replied finn with a groan . " do n't be cast down , " said oonagh . " depend on me , and , maybe , i 'll bring you out of this scrape better than ever you could bring yourself . " this quieted finn 's heart very much , for he knew that oonagh was hand - and - glove with the fairies . indeed , to tell the truth , she was supposed to be a fairy herself . if she was , however , she must have been a kind - hearted one , for by all accounts she never did anything but good in the neighbourhood . now , it so happened that oonagh had a sister named granua living opposite to them , on the very top of cullamore , which i have mentioned already . this granua was quite as powerful as herself . the beautiful valley that lies between the granlisses is not more than three or four miles broad , so that of a summer evening granua and oonagh were able to hold many an agreeable conversation across it , from one hill - top to the other . upon this occasion oonagh resolved to consult her sister as to what was best to be done in the difficulty that surrounded them . " granua , " said she , " are you at home ? " " no , " said the other , " i 'm picking bilberries at althadhawan " ( the devil 's glen ) . " well , " said oonagh , " go up to the top of cullamore , look about you , and then tell us what you see . " " very well , " replied granua , after a few minutes ; " i am there now . " " what do you see ? " asked the other . " goodness be about us ! " exclaimed granua , " i see the biggest giant that ever was known coming up from dungannon . " " ay , " said oonagh , " there 's our difficulty . that 's far rua , and he 's comin ' up now to leather finn . what 's to be done ? "
