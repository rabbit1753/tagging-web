the bamboo cane stood by , looking stiff and proud . he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top , and on the sofa lay two worked cushions , pretty but stupid . when the play at the little theatre began , the rest sat and looked on ; they were requested to applaud and stamp , or crack , when they felt gratified with what they saw . but the riding - whip said he never cracked for old people , only for the young who were not yet married . " i crack for everybody , " said the cracker . " yes , and a fine noise you make , " thought the audience , as the play went on . it was not worth much , but it was very well played , and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience , for they were made only to be seen on one side . the acting was wonderful , excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps , because the wires were a little too long . the doll , whose neck had been darned , was so excited that the place in her neck burst , and the money - pig declared he must do something for one of the players , as they had all pleased him so much . so he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will , as the one to be buried with him in the family vault , whenever that event should happen . they all enjoyed the comedy so much , that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party , and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement , which they called playing at men and women ; and there was nothing wrong about it , for it was only play .
