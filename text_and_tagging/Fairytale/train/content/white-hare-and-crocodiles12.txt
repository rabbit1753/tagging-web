just then another king 's son passed by , carrying a great bag on his back . he saw the hare , and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly . but the poor hare , remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke to him , did not answer , but continued to cry . but this man had a kind heart , and looked at the hare very pityingly , and said : " you poor thing ! i see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare . who can have treated you so cruelly ? " when the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man . encouraged by his gentle manner the hare told him all that had befallen him . the little animal hid nothing from his friend , but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had come across the bridge they had made , thinking that he wished to count their number . he told him how he had jeered at them for their stupidity , and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves on him . then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like his kind friend . the hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again .
