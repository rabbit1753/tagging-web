very angry , indeed , were the devils . they shook their horns and their shocks of red hair fiercely , and rushed to put on tiger skin trousers to make themselves look more terrible . they then brought out great iron bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads , and tried to knock him down . the pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow , and then attacked the head of first one and then another demon . he flew round and round them , beating the air with his wings so fiercely and ceaselessly , that the devils began to wonder whether they had to fight one or many more birds .
