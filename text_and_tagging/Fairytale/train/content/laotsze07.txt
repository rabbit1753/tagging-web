then the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth and pleaded for him . he promised to pay the servant for laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life . so laotsze placed the talisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again . the guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him . then he adored laotsze as his master , and the latter taught him the art of eternal life , and left him his teachings , in five thousand words , which the guardian wrote down . the book which thus came into being is the tao teh king , " the book of the way and life . " laotsze then disappeared from the eyes of men . the guardian of the pass however , followed his teachings , and was given a place among the immortals .
