he turned the dragon out into the sea at last . he went away then , and said that he would return the next day . he left the steed again in the place where he found it , and he took the fine suit off him , and when the other people returned he was before them . when the people came home that night they were all talking and saying that some champion came to fight with the dragon and turned him out into the sea again . that was the story that every person had , but they did not know who was the champion who did it . the next day , when his master and the other people were gone , he went to the castle of the three giants again , and he took out another steed and another suit of valour ( i.e. , armour ) , and he brought with him the second giant 's sword , and he went to the place where the dragon was to come . the king 's daughter was bound to a post on the shore , waiting for him , and the eyes going out on her head looking would she see the champion coming who fought the dragon the day before . there were twice as many people in it as there were on the first day , and they were all waiting till they would see the champion coming . when the dragon came the lad went in face of him , and the dragon was half confused and sickened after the fight that he had made the day before . they were beating one another till the evening , and then he drove away the dragon . the people tried to keep him , but they were not able . he went from them .
