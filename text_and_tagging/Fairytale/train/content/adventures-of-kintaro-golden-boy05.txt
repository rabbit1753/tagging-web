one day , as usual , kintaro went up into the mountains , followed by the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare . after walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads , they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers . here , indeed , was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together . the deer rubbed his horns against a tree for pleasure , the monkey scratched his back , the hare smoothed his long ears , and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction .
