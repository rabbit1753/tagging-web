' shall we land here ? ' asked the dream - boy . ' no , ' said little lasse . ' the sun would burn us , and the lions and the crocodiles would eat us up . let us travel to another part of the world . ' ' we can travel back to europe , ' said the dream - boy with the fair hair . and with that they were there . they came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly . there stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves ; at the top sat the old crow , and at its foot crept the gardener 's black cat . not far away was a house which little lasse had seen before ; near the house there was a garden , and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells . an old gardener with a green coat walked about and wondered if the cucumbers were ripe . fylax was barking on the steps , and when he saw little lasse he wagged his tail . old stina was milking the cows in the farmyard , and there was a very familiar lady in a check woollen shawl on her way to the bleaching green to see if the clothes were bleached . there was , too , a well - known gentleman in a yellow summer coat , with a long pipe in his mouth ; he was going to see if the reapers had cut the rye . a boy and a girl were running on the shore and calling out , ' little lasse ! come home for bread - and - butter ! ' ' shall we land here ? ' asked the dream - boy , and he blinked his blue eyes roguishly . ' come with me , and i shall ask mother to give you some bread - and - butter and a glass of milk , ' said little lasse .
