this he would do , said the king 's son . he sat there with her all day long , for they had soon agreed that they would marry , he and the king 's daughter , and in this way his first day in the giant 's service did not weary him at all . when evening came on , she told him that now he must clean out the stable before the giant came . when he got there he thought he would try out her advice , and began to use the shovel as he had seen his father 's grooms use it . and sure enough , he had to stop quickly . after he had worked a little while , he hardly had room in which to stand . then he did as the king 's daughter had told him , turned the shovel around and used the handle . and in a wink the stable was as clean as though it had been scrubbed . when he had finished he went to the room that the giant had assigned him , and walked up and down , whistling and singing . then the giant came home with his goats . " have you cleaned out the stable ? " he asked . " yes , indeed , master , it is spick and span , " said the king 's son . " i 'll have to see that , " said the giant , and went into the stable . it was just as the king 's son had said . " you surely have been talking to the master girl , for you could not have done that alone , " said the giant . " master girl ? what is a master girl ? " said the king 's son , and pretended to be very stupid . " i 'd like to see her , too . " " you will see her in plenty of time , " said the giant .
