once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie , who lived at a farm called little - town . she was a good little girl -- only she was always losing her pocket - handkerchiefs ! one day little lucie came into the farm - yard crying -- oh , she did cry so ! " i 've lost my pocket - handkin ! three handkins and a pinny ! have you seen them , tabby kitten ? " the kitten went on washing her white paws ; so lucie asked a speckled hen-- " sally henny - penny , has you found three pocket - handkins ? " but the speckled hen ran into a barn , clucking-- " i go barefoot , barefoot , barefoot ! " and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig .
