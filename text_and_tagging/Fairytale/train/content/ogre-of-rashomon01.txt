long , long ago in kyoto , the people of the city were terrified by accounts of a dreadful ogre , who , it was said , haunted the gate of rashomon at twilight and seized whoever passed by . the missing victims were never seen again , so it was whispered that the ogre was a horrible cannibal , who not only killed the unhappy victims but ate them also . now everybody in the town and neighborhood was in great fear , and no one durst venture out after sunset near the gate of rashomon .
