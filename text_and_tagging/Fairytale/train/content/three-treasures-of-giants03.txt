a little while after , the father fell ill , and sent for his sons , who were out hunting , to bid him farewell . after giving good advice to the two eldest , he turned to jack . ' my boy , ' he said , ' you have not got quite as much sense as other people , but if heaven has deprived you of some of your wits , it was given you a kind heart . always listen to what it says , and take heed to the words of your mother and brothers , as well as you are able ! ' so saying the old man sank back on his pillows and died . the cries of grief uttered by martin and michael sounded through the house , but jack remained by the bedside of his father , still and silent , as if he were dead also . at length he got up , and going into the garden , hid himself in some trees , and wept like a child , while his two brothers made ready for the funeral .
