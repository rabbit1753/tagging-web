when he came to the yellow river on his journey , he did what the lord of the great mountain had told him , and cried : " greencoat ! " and sure enough , a girl in green garments rose from the water , took him by the hand and told him to close his eyes . then she led him into the palace of the river - god and he delivered the letter . the river - god entertained him splendidly , and thanked him as best he knew how . at parting he said : " i am grateful that you have made this long journey to see me . i have nothing to give you , however , save this pair of green silk shoes . while you are wearing them you can keep on walking as long as you like and never grow weary . and they will give you the second sight , so that you will be able to see the spirits and gods .
