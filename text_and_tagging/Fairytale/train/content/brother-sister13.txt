so as soon as the sun had gone down , the king said to the huntsmen : " now , come and show me the little house in the wood . " and when he got to the door he knocked at it , and cried , " little sister , let me in ! " then the door opened , and the king went in , and there stood a maiden more beautiful than any he had seen before . the maiden shrieked out when she saw , instead of the fawn , a man standing there with a gold crown on his head . but the king looked kindly on her , took her by the hand , and said , " will you go with me to my castle , and be my dear wife ? " " oh yes , " answered the maiden , " but the fawn must come too . i could not leave him . " and the king said , " he shall remain with you as long as you live , and shall lack nothing . " then the fawn came bounding in , and the sister tied the cord of rushes to him , and led him by her own hand out of the little house .
