when he was safe on shore the little hare said to him : ' now this is what you have to do : dress yourself like a breton seeking a place as stable - boy , and go and offer your services to your father . once there , you will easily be able to make him understand the truth . ' the young man did as the little hare bade him , and he went to his father 's castle and enquired if they were not in want of a stable - boy . ' yes , ' replied his father , ' very much indeed . but it is not an easy place . there is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyone go near it , and it has already kicked to death several people who have tried to groom it . ' ' i will undertake to groom it , ' said the youth . ' i never saw the horse i was afraid of yet . ' the little horse allowed itself to be rubbed down without a toss of its head and without a kick . ' good gracious ! ' exclaimed the master ; ' how is it that he lets you touch him , when no one else can go near him ? ' ' perhaps he knows me , ' answered the stable - boy .
