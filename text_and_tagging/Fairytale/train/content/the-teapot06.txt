" i saw it , i bore it , i forgot myself in its delight . blessed is it to forget oneself in another . the flower gave me no thanks ; it did not think of me . it was admired and praised , and i was glad at that . how happy it must have been ! one day i heard some one say that the flower deserved a better pot . i was thumped hard on my back , which was a great affliction , and the flower was put into a better pot . i was thrown out into the yard , where i lie as an old potsherd . but i have the memory , and that i can never lose .
