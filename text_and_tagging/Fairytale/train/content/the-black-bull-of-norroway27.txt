so , as she knew that the young gallant intended returning for it that very night , and as she wanted her daughter to get the credit of washing it , she advised the princess to go to bed early , in order to get a good night 's rest after all her labours . and the princess followed her advice , and thus it came about that she was sound asleep , safely hidden in the big box - bed in the corner , when the black knight of norroway came to the cottage to claim his white mantle . now you must know that the young man had carried about this mantle with him for the last seven years -- ever since his encounter with the evil spirit of the glen -- always trying to find someone who could wash it for him , and never succeeding . for it had been revealed to him by a wise woman that she who could make it white and clean was destined to be his wife -- be she bonnie or ugly , old or young . and that , moreover , she would prove a loving , a faithful , and a true helpmeet . so when he came to the washerwoman 's cottage , and received back his mantle white as the driven snow , and heard that it was the washerwoman 's daughter who had wrought this wondrous change , he said at once that he would marry her , and that the very next day .
