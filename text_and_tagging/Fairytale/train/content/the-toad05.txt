" oh , it is such a splendid and precious thing , that i can not describe it , " said the mother - toad . " it 's something which one carries about for one 's own pleasure , and that makes other people angry . but do n't ask me any questions , for i sha n't answer you . " " well , i have n't got the jewel , " said the smallest of the toads ; she was as ugly as a toad can be . " why should i have such a precious thing ? and if it makes others angry , it ca n't give me any pleasure . no , i only wish i could get to the edge of the well , and look out . it must be beautiful up there . " " you 'd better stay where you are , " said the old mother - toad , " for you know everything here , and you can tell what you have . take care of the bucket , for it will crush you to death . even if you get into it safely , you may fall out . and it 's not every one who falls so cleverly as i did , and gets away with whole legs and whole bones . " " quack ! " said the little toad . that 's just as if one of us were to say , " aha ! "
