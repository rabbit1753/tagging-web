but , when he came to his abbey , he found a wondrous change . he saw no friendly faces there , for every face was strange . the strange men spoke unto him . and he heard from all and each the foreign tongue of the sassenach , not wholesome irish speech . then the oldest monk came forward . in irish tongue , he spoke : " you wearest the holy augustine 's dress , and who hath given it to you ? " " i wear the holy augustine 's dress , and cormac is my name . the abbot of this good abbey by grace of god i am . i went forth to pray , at the dawn of day . and when my prayers were said , i hearken'd awhile to a little bird that sung above my head . " the monks to him made answer , " two hundred years have gone over , since our abbot cormac went through the gate , and never was heard of more . matthias now is our abbot , and twenty have pass'd away . the stranger is lord of ireland . we live in an evil day . " " days will come and go . " he said , " and the world will pass away . in heaven a day is a thousand years , a thousand years are a day . "
