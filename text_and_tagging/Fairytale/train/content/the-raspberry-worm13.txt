' i am so hungry , ' said lisa . ' yes , ' said aina , ' if we had only two good meat sandwiches now . ' as she said that , she felt something in her hand , and when she looked down , she saw a large sandwich of bread and chicken , and at the same time lisa said : ' how very queer ! i have a sandwich in my hand . ' ' and i , too , ' said aina . ' will you dare to eat it ? ' ' of course i will , ' said lisa . ' ah , if we only had a good glass of milk now ! ' just as she said that she felt a large glass of milk between her fingers , and at the same time aina cried out , ' lisa ! lisa ! i have a glass of milk in my hand ! is n't it queer ? ' the girls , however , were very hungry , so they ate and drank with a good appetite . when they had finished aina yawned , stretched out her arms and said : ' oh , if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now ! ' scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side , and there beside lisa was one too . this seemed to the girls more and more wonderful , but tired and sleepy as they were , they thought no more about it , but crept into the little beds , drew the coverlets over their heads and were soon asleep .
