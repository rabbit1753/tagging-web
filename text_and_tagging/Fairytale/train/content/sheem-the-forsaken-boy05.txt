the sister replied : " i do not say no , my brother , to what you desire . we are not forbidden the society of our fellow - mortals , but we are told to cherish each other , and to do nothing that shall not be agreeable to all our little household . neither pleasure nor pain ought , therefore , to separate us , especially from our younger brother , who , being but a child , and weakly withal , is entitled to a double share of our affection . if we follow our separate fancies , it will surely make us neglect him , whom we are bound by vows , both to our father and mother , to support . " the young man received this address in silence , and still took his course as though nothing out of the ordinary way had occurred . after awhile he seemed to recover his spirits . as they lived in a large country , where there were open fields , the two brothers , at his invitation , often amused themselves in playing ball . one afternoon he chose the ground near to a beautiful lake , and they played and laughed with great spirit . the ball was seldom allowed to touch the ground .
