once upon a time a lad who tended the cattle in the wood was eating his noon - tide meal in a clearing in the forest . as he was sitting there he saw a rat run into a juniper - bush . his curiosity led him to look for it . as he bent over , down he went , head over heels , and fell asleep . and he dreamed that he was going to find the princess on the mount of the golden queen ; but that he did not know the way .
