when he had reached its highest peak , he greeted the beautiful princess with great courtesy , kneeled before her , and received the golden apple from her hand . then he flung about his steed , and rode down the glass mountain again , so that the sparks flew about the golden hoofs of his horse , and a long ribbon of golden light gleamed behind him . at last he disappeared in the wood like a star . what a commotion now reigned about the mountain ! the people broke forth into cheers that could be heard far away , horns sounded , trumpets called , horses neighed , arms clashed , and the king had proclaimed far and near that the unknown golden knight had won the prize .
