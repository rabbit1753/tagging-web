" oh , what would i not give to come to my child ! " said the weeping mother . she wept still more , and her eyes sunk down in the depths of the waters , and became two precious pearls . but the water bore her up , as if she sat in a swing , and she flew in the rocking waves to the shore on the opposite side . there stood a mile - broad , strange house , one knew not if it were a mountain with forests and caverns , or if it were built up . but the poor mother could not see it . she had wept her eyes out . " where shall i find death , who took away my little child ? " said she . " he has not come here yet ! " said the old grave woman , who was appointed to look after death 's great greenhouse ! " how have you been able to find the way hither ? and who has helped you ? " " our lord has helped me , " said she . " he is merciful , and you will also be so ! where shall i find my little child ? "
