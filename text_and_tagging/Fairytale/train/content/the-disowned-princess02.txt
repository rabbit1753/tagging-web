the woman began to sob and said : " fortune has forsaken me , and i am in need and ashamed . since you are kind enough to ask i will tell you all . i am the youngest daughter of the dragon - king of the sea of dungting , and was married to the second son of the dragon - king of ging dschou . yet my husband ill - treated and disowned me . i complained to my step - parents , but they loved their son blindly and did nothing . and when i grew insistent they both became angry , and i was sent out here to herd sheep . " when she had done , the woman burst into tears and lost all control of herself . then she continued : " the sea of dungting is far from here ; yet i know that you will have to pass it on your homeward journey . i should like to give you a letter to my father , but i do not know whether you would take it .
