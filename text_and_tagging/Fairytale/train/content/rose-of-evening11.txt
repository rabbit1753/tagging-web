but the willow - spray dancers were now called out . the prince of the dragon cave was especially desirous of testing aduan . so aduan danced alone , and he danced with joy or defiance according to the music . when he looked up and when he looked down his glances held the beat of the measure . the dragon prince , enchanted with his skill , presented him with a garment of five colors , and gave him a carbuncle set in golden threads of fish - beard for a hair - jewel . aduan bowed his thanks for the gift , and then also hastened to the western courtyard . there all the dancers stood in rank and file . aduan could only look at rose of evening from a distance , but still rose of evening returned his glances . after a time aduan gradually slipped to the end of his file and rose of evening also drew near to him , so that they stood only a few feet away from each other . but the strict rules allowed no confusion in the ranks , so they could only gaze and let their souls go out to each other . now the butterfly dance followed the others . this was danced by the boys and girls together , and the pairs were equal in size , age and the color of their garments . when all the dances had ended , the dancers marched out with the goose - step . the willow - spray dancers followed the swallow dancers , and aduan hastened in advance of his company , while rose of evening lingered along after hers . she turned her head , and when she spied aduan she purposely let a coral pin fall from her hair . aduan hastily hid it in his sleeve .
