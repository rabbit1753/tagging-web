as the goat flew upward , the comrade swung himself up in back , and then they were off like the wind through the clouds : it was not a long journey . suddenly they stood before a wall of rock , she knocked , and then they took their way into the interior of the hill , to the troll who was her dearest . " and now a new suitor has come who wants to win me , sweetheart , " said she . " he is young and handsome , but i will have none but you , " she went on , and made a great time over the troll . " i have set him a test , and here are the shears that he was to keep and guard . you shall keep them now ! " then both of them laughed as though the youth had already lost his head . " yes , i will keep them , and take good care of them , and a kiss from you shall pledge the truth , when crows are cawing around the youth ! " said the troll . he laid the shears in an iron chest with three locks . but at the moment he was dropping the shears into the chest , the comrade caught them up . none could see him , for he was wearing the three - sisters hat . so the troll carefully locked the empty chest , and put the key into a hollow double - tooth , where he kept other magic things . " the suitor could hardly find it there , " said he .
