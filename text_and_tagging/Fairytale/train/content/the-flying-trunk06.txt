' yes , i shall only bring a fairy story for my dowry , ' said he , and so they parted . but the princess gave him a sabre set with gold pieces which he could use . then he flew away , bought himself a new dressing - gown , and sat down in the wood and began to make up a story , for it had to be ready by saturday , and that was no easy matter . when he had it ready it was saturday . the sultan , the sultana , and the whole court were at tea with the princess . he was most graciously received .
