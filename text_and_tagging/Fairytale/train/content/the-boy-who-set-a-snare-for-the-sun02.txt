she accordingly left him at the gathering - place of the wood , and returned to the lodge . toward night - fall she heard his little footsteps crackling through the snow . he hurried in and threw down , with an air of triumph , one of the birds which he had killed . " my sister , " said he , " i wish you to skin it , and stretch the skin , and when i have killed more , i will have a coat made out of them . " " but what shall we do with the body ? " said she ; for they had always up to that time lived upon greens and berries . " cut it in two , " he answered , " and season our pottage with one half of it at a time . " it was their first dish of game , and they relished it greatly . the boy kept on in his efforts , and in the course of time he killed ten birds - out of the skins of which his sister made him a little coat . being very small , he had a very pretty coat , and a bird skin to spare .
