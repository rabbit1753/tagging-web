some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water -- but the water was already running over , for the can was no bigger than an egg - cup ! and where the sand upon the path was wet -- there were foot - marks of a very small person . lucie ran on , and on . the path ended under a big rock . the grass was short and green , and there were clothes - props cut from bracken stems , with lines of plaited rushes , and a heap of tiny clothes pins -- but no pocket - handkerchiefs ! but there was something else -- a door ! straight into the hill ; and inside it some one was singing-- " lily - white and clean , oh ! with little frills between , oh ! smooth and hot -- red rusty spot never here be seen , oh !
