in the middle of a great forest there lived a long time ago a charcoal - burner and his wife . they were both young and handsome and strong . when they got married , they thought work would never fail them . but bad times came , and they grew poorer and poorer . the nights in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent . now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the charcoal - burner 's hut . as he passed the door , he heard a sound of sobbing . being a good - natured man he stopped to listen , thinking that perhaps he might be able to give some help . ' were there ever two people so unhappy ! ' said a woman 's voice . ' here we are , ready to work like slaves the whole day long , and no work can we get . and it is all because of the curiosity of old mother eve ! if she had only been like me , who never want to know anything . we should all have been as happy as kings to - day , with plenty to eat , and warm clothes to wear . why-- ' but at this point a loud knock interrupted her lamentations .
