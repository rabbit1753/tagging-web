" alas , perhaps he is a troll , after all , " said the mother . " but i can give you some good advice as to how you can see him . here is a candle - end , which you must hide under your wimple . when the troll is sleeping , light the light and look at him . but be careful not to let a drop of tallow fall on him . " the daughter took the candle - end and hid it in her wimple , and in the evening the white bear came to fetch her . after they had gone a way the white bear asked whether everything had not happened just as he had said . yes , such had been the case , and the maiden could not deny it . " if you have listened to your mother 's advice , then you will make us both unhappy , and all will be over between us , " said the bear . " o , no , she had not done so , " replied the maiden , indeed she had not .
