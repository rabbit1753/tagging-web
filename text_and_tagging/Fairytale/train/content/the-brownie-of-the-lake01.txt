once upon a time there lived in france a man whose name was jalm riou . you might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more contented , for he had a large farm , plenty of money , and above all , a daughter called barbaik , the most graceful dancer and the best - dressed girl in the whole country side . when she appeared on holidays in her embroidered cap , five petticoats , each one a little shorter than the other , and shoes with silver buckles , the women were all filled with envy , but little cared barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else 's and that she had more partners than any other girl .
