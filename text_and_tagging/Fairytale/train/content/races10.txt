" what is the first prize ? " asked the earthworm , who had overslept the time , and only now came up . " it contains a free admission to a cabbage - garden , " replied the mule . " i proposed that as one of the prizes . the hare most decidedly must have it ; and i , as an active and thoughtful member of the committee , took especial care that the prize should be one of advantage to him ; so now he is provided for . the snail can now sit on the fence , and lick up moss and sunshine . he has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing . it is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the thing men call a ' committee . ' i must say i expect much in the future ; we have already made such a good beginning . "
