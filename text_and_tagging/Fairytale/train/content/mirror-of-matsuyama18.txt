but it is a woman 's danger to be petty and mean , and step - mothers are proverbial all the world over , and this one 's heart was not as her first smiles were . as the days and weeks grew into months , the step - mother began to treat the motherless girl unkindly and to try and come between the father and child . sometimes she went to her husband and complained of her step - daughter 's behavior , but the father knowing that this was to be expected , took no notice of her ill - natured complaints . instead of lessening his affection for his daughter , as the woman desired , her grumblings only made him think of her the more . the woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely child than before . this did not please her at all , and she began to turn over in her mind how she could , by some means or other , drive her step - child out of the house . so crooked did the woman 's heart become .
