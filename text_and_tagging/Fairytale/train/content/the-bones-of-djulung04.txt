at length , one morning early , a cock began to crow so loud that she could sleep no longer and as he continued to crow she seemed to understand what he was saying . he was telling her that djulung was dead , killed and eaten by her sisters . his bones lay buried under the kitchen fire . very softly she got up , and took up the large stone under the fire . she was creeping out carried the bones to the cave by the fountain , where she dug a hole and buried them anew . and as she scooped out the hole with a stick she sang a song , bidding the bones grow till they became a tree . a tree that reached up so high into the heavens that its leaves would fall across the sea into another island , whose king would pick them up . as there was no djulung to give her rice to , the girl soon became fat again . as she was able to do her work as of old , her sisters did not trouble about her . they never guessed that when she went into the forest to gather her sticks . she never failed to pay a visit to the tree , which grew taller and more wonderful day by day . never was such a tree seen before . its trunk was of iron , its leaves were of silk , its flowers of gold , and its fruit of diamonds . one evening , though the girl did not know it , a soft breeze took one of the leaves , and blew it across the sea to the feet of one of the king 's attendants .
