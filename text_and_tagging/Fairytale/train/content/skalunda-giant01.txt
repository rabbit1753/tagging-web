in the skalunda mountain , near the church , there once lived a giant in the early days , who no longer felt comfortable after the church had been built there . he decided that he could no longer stand the ringing of the church bells ; so he emigrated and settled down on an island far out in the north sea . once upon a time a ship was wrecked on this island , and among those saved were several people from skalunda .
