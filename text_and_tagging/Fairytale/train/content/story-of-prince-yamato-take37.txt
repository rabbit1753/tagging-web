when they reached the seashore at idzu his men sought for boats in which to cross the straits to kadzusa , but it was difficult to find boats enough to allow all the soldiers to embark . then the prince stood on the beach , and in the pride of his strength he scoffed and said : " this is not the sea ! this is only a brook ! why do you men want so many boats ? i could jump this if i would . " when at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the straits , the sky suddenly clouded and a great storm arose . the waves rose mountains high , the wind howled , the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled , and the boat which held ototachibana and the prince and his men was tossed from crest to crest of the rolling waves , till it seemed that every moment must be their last and that they must all be swallowed up in the angry sea . for kin jin , the dragon king of the sea , had heard yamato take jeer , and had raised this terrible storm in anger , to show the scoffing prince how awful the sea could be though it did but look like a brook .
