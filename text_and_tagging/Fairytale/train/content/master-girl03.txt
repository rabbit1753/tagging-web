then the king 's son said : " better and better ! but if he cooks gold here , i wonder what he cooks inside , there ? " and he wanted to see , so he went into the fourth room . here there was no kettle to be seen . but a maiden sat on a bench who must have been a king 's daughter . yet whatever she might be , the king 's son had never seen any one so beautiful in all his days . " now in heaven 's name , what are you doing here ? " asked the maiden . " i hired myself out here yesterday , " said the king 's son . " may god be your aid , for it is a fine service you have chosen ! " said she . " o , the master is very friendly , " said the king 's son . " he has given me no hard work to do to - day . when i have cleaned out the stable , i need do nothing more . " " yes , but how are you going to manage it ? " she went on . " if you do as the others have done , then for every shovelful you pitch out , ten fresh shovelfuls will fly in . but i 'll tell you how to go about it . you must turn around the shovel , and work with the handle , then everything will fly out by itself .
