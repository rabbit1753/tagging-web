the roads crossed each other in the depths of the forest , and she no longer knew whither she should go ! then there stood a thorn - bush . there was neither leaf nor flower on it , it was also in the cold winter season , and ice - flakes hung on the branches . " hast thou not seen death go past with my little child ? " said the mother . " yes , " said the thorn - bush . " but i will not tell thee which way he took , unless thou wilt first warm me up at thy heart . i am freezing to death . i shall become a lump of ice ! " and she pressed the thorn - bush to her breast , so firmly , that it might be thoroughly warmed . the thorns went right into her flesh , and her blood flowed in large drops , but the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves , and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night , the heart of the afflicted mother was so warm . the thorn - bush told her the way she should go .
