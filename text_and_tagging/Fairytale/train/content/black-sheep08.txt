" why , what could you do with a bag of wool ? " questioned the farmer . " i want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane . he is very poor and needs a new coat . " " very well , " answered the master ; " if you can grow three bags full i will give one to the little boy . " so the black sheep began to grow wool , and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock . she always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures , and drank from the clearest part of the brook , and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep - sorrel . and each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing .
