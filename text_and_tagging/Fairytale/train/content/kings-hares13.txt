when they were through she gave esben a whistle which had the power that if he blew into one end , whatever he wished scattered was scattered to all the winds , and when he blew into the other , all came together again . and if the whistle passed from his possession , it would return as soon as he wished it back . " that is a wonderful whistle ! " thought esben . he showed her his whistle , and blew into one end , and all the hares darted away across the hills in all directions , and then he blew into the other , and they came trotting up from all sides , and once more stood in rank and file . " that is a wonderful whistle , " said the chamber - maid . she would gladly give him a hundred dollars , if he cared to sell it . " yes , it is a splendid whistle , " said esben , " and i will not sell it for money . but if you give me a hundred dollars , and a kiss with every dollar to boot , then i might let you have it . " yes , indeed , that would suit her right down to the ground ; she would gladly give him two kisses with every dollar , and feel grateful , besides .
