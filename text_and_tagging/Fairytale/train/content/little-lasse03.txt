' i shall row out a little way -- only a very little way , ' he thought . the pea - shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little specks on the ocean . ' i shall seize hercules on the coast of asia , ' said lasse , ' and then row home again to europe . ' he shook the rope that held the boat , and , strange to say , the rope became loose . ditsch , ratsch , a man is a man , and so little lasse manned the boat . now he would row -- and he could row , for he had rowed so often on the step sat home , when the steps pretended to be a boat and father 's big stick an oar . but when little lasse wanted to row there were no oars to be found in the boat . the oars were locked up in the boat - house , and little lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty . it is not so easy as one thinks to row to asia without oars . what could little lasse do now ? the boat was already some distance out on the sea , and the wind , which blew from land , was driving it still further out . lasse was frightened and began to cry . but there was no one on the shore to hear him . only a big crow perched alone in the birch tree ; and the gardener 's black cat sat under the birch tree , waiting to catch the crow . neither of them troubled themselves in the least about little lasse , who was drifting out to sea .
