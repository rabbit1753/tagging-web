" oh , " he replied , " i found it on the ice . it was caught in our lake . have we no right to a little lake of our own ? i shall claim all the fish that come out of its waters . " " how , " the sister asked again , " could you have got it there ? " " no matter , " said the boy ; " go and cook it . " it was as much as the girl could do to drag the great trout within doors . she cooked it , and its flavor was so delicious that she asked no more questions as to how he had come by it . the next morning the little spirit or boy - man set off as he had the day before . he made all sorts of sport with his ball as he frolicked along . high over his head he would toss it , straight up into the air ; then far before him . and again , in mere merriment of spirit , he would send it bounding back , as if he had plenty of speed and enough to spare in running back after it . the ball leaped and bounded about , and glided through the air as if it were a live thing , and enjoyed the sport as much as the boy - man himself .
