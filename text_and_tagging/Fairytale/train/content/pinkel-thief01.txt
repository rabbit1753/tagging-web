long , long ago there lived a widow who had three sons . the two eldest were grown up , and though they were known to be idle fellows , some of the neighbours had given them work to do on account of the respect in which their mother was held . but at the time this story begins they had both been so careless and idle that their masters declared they would keep them no longer . so home they went to their mother and youngest brother , of whom they thought little , because he made himself useful about the house , and looked after the hens , and milked the cow . ' pinkel , ' they called him in scorn , and by - and - by ' pinkel ' became his name throughout the village .
