" i do n't mind , " bleated a young lamb named frisky , as it kicked up its heels and gambolled about upon the grass ; " it 's nice to have all that heavy wool cut off my back , for i sha'n't have to carry it around wherever i go . " " oh , indeed ! " sneered the ram , " you like it , do you ? have you any idea what you look like , all sheared down to your skin ? how would you like to have someone come along and see you , now that you are all head and legs ? "
