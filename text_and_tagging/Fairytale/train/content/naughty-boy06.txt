and all good children to whom he related this story , took great heed of this naughty cupid ; but he made fools of them still , for he is astonishingly cunning . when the university students come from the lectures , he runs beside them in a black coat , and with a book under his arm . it is quite impossible for them to know him , and they walk along with him arm in arm , as if he , too , were a student like themselves . then , unperceived , he thrusts an arrow to their bosom . when the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman , or go to church to be confirmed , there he is again close behind them . yes , he is forever following people . at the play , he sits in the great chandelier and burns in bright flames , so that people think it is really a flame , but they soon discover it is something else . he roves about in the garden of the palace and upon the ramparts : yes , once he even shot your father and mother right in the heart . ask them only and you will hear what they 'll tell you .
