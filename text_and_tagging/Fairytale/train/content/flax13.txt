" the children are all out of school , and the schoolmaster was the last of all , " said the children . it was good fun , and they sang over the dead ashes : " snip , snap , snurre , basse lurre . the song is ended . " but the little invisible beings said , " the song is never ended ; the most beautiful is yet to come . " but the children could neither hear nor understand this ; nor should they , for children must not know everything .
