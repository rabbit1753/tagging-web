when the hare had finished his story , the man was full of pity towards him , and said : " i am very sorry for all you have suffered , but remember , it was only the consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles . " " i know , " answered the sorrowful hare , " but i have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again . i beg you to show me how i may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again . " " then i will tell you of a good remedy , " said the man . " first go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body . then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water . spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them . if you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again , and you will be quite well in a little while .
