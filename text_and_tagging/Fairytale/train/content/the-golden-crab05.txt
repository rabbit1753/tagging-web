the old man went and did his errand . when he had brought the precious robes , the crab put on the golden garment and then crept upon the golden cushion , and in this way the fisherman carried him to the castle , where the crab presented the other garment to his bride . now the ceremony took place , and when the married pair were alone together the crab made himself known to his young wife , and told her how he was the son of the greatest king in the world , and how he was enchanted , so that he became a crab by day and was a man only at night ; and he could also change himself into an eagle as often as he wished . no sooner had he said this than he shook himself , and immediately became a handsome youth , but the next morning he was forced to creep back again into his crab - shell . and the same thing happened every day . but the princess 's affection for the crab , and the polite attention with which she behaved to him , surprised the royal family very much . they suspected some secret , but though they spied and spied , they could not discover it . thus a year passed away , and the princess had a son , whom she called benjamin . but her mother still thought the whole matter very strange . at last she said to the king that he ought to ask his daughter whether she would not like to have another husband instead of the crab ? but when the daughter was questioned she only answered : ' i am married to the crab , and him only will i have .
