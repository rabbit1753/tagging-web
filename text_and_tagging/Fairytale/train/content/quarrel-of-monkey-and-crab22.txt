with this he wandered out into the crab settlement and crept about as slyly as possible near the crab 's house and tried to hear the neighbors ' gossip round about . he wanted to find out what the crabs were saying about their chief 's death , for the old crab had been the chief of the tribe . but he heard nothing and said to himself : " they are all such fools that they do n't know and do n't care who murdered their chief ! " little did he know in his so - called " monkey 's wisdom " that this seeming unconcern was part of the young crab 's plan . he purposely pretended not to know who killed his father , and also to believe that he had met his death through his own fault . by this means he could the better keep secret the revenge on the monkey , which he was meditating . so the monkey returned home from his walk quite content . he told himself he had nothing now to fear .
