there was a witch woman in that country whose name was " sigh , sough , storm , rough wind , winter night , cry , wail , and groan . " star - bright and beautiful was she in face and form , but inwardly she was cruel as her names . and she hated murtough because he had scattered and destroyed the ancient peoples of the fairy tribes of erin , her country and her fatherland , and because in the battle which he fought at cerb on the boyne her father and her mother and her sister had been slain . for in those days women went to battle side by side with men . she knew , too , that with the coming of the new faith trouble would come upon the fairy folk , and their power and their great majesty would depart from them , and men would call them demons , and would drive them out with psalm - singing and with the saying of prayers , and with the sound of little tinkling bells .
