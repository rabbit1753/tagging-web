far , far from here , in a great forest , there once lived a poor couple . heaven blessed them with a charming little daughter ; but they were so poor they did not know how they were going to get her christened . so her father had to go forth to see whether he could not find a god - father to pay for the child 's christening . all day long he went from one to another ; but no one wanted to be the god - father . toward evening , as he was going home , he met a very lovely lady , who wore the most splendid clothes , and seemed most kind and friendly . she offered to see that the child was christened , if she might be allowed to keep it afterward . the man replied that first he must ask his wife . but when he reached home and asked her she gave him a flat " no . " the following day the man set out again ; but no one wanted to be the god - father if he had to pay for the christening himself . no matter how hard the man begged , it was all of no avail . when he went home that evening , he again met the lovely lady , who looked so gentle , and she made him the same offer as before . the man again told his wife what had happened to him , and added that if he could not find a god - father for his child the following day , they would probably have to let the lady take her , since she seemed to be so kind and friendly . the man then went out for the third time , and found no god - father that day . and so , when he once more met the friendly lady in the evening , he promised to let her have the child , if she would see that it was baptized . the following morning the lady came to the man 's hut , and with her two other men . she then took the child and went to church with it , and it was baptized . then she took it with her , and the little girl remained with her for several years , and her foster - mother was always good and kind to her .
