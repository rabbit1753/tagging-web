" " but , why should anybody want to buy such a cap as that ? " said the king . " because , " said boots , " it is a fooling cap and the only one in all of the world . " " a fooling cap ! " said the king . for he did not like to hear of such a cap as that coming into the town . " hum - m - m - m ! i should like to see you fool somebody with it . could you fool that old body yonder with the pots and the crocks ? "
