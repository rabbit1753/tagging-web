have you ever seen a maiden ? i mean what our pavers call a maiden , a thing with which they ram down the paving - stones in the roads . a maiden of this kind is made altogether of wood , broad below , and girt round with iron rings . at the top she is narrow , and has a stick passed across through her waist , and this stick forms the arms of the maiden . in the shed stood two maidens of this kind . they had their place among shovels , hand - carts , wheelbarrows , and measuring - tapes ; and to all this company the news had come that the maidens were no longer to be called " maidens , " but " hand - rammers , " which word was the newest and the only correct designation among the pavers for the thing we all know from the old times by the name of " the maiden .
