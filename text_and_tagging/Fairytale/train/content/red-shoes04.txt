everybody looked at her feet , and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments , in their stiff collars and long black robes , had their eyes fixed on her red shoes . it was only of these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holy baptism , of the covenant with god , and told her that she was now to be a grown - up christian . the organ pealed forth solemnly , and the sweet children 's voices mingled with that of their old leader ; but karen thought only of her red shoes . in the afternoon the old lady heard from everybody that karen had worn red shoes . she said that it was a shocking thing to do , that it was very improper , and that karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes , even if they were old .
