once upon a time there was a poor man , who had only one son ; but one who was so lazy and clumsy that he did not want to do a stroke of work . " if i am not to feed this bean - pole for the rest of my life , i 'll have to send him far away , where not a soul knows him , " thought the father . " once he is knocking about in the world , he will not be so likely to come home again . " so he took his son and led him about in the world , far and wide , and tried to get him taken on as a serving man ; but no one would have him . finally , after wandering a long time , they came to a rich man , of whom it was said that he turned every shilling around seven times before he could make up his mind to part with it . he was willing to take the youth for a servant , and he was to work three years without pay . but at the end of the three years , his master was to go into town , two days in succession , and buy the first thing he saw , and on the third morning the youth himself was to go to town and also buy the first thing he met . and all this he was to receive in lieu of his wage .
