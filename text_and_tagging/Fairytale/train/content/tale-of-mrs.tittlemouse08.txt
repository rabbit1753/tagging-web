she fetched soft soap , and flannel , and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom . but she was too tired to do any more . first she fell asleep in her chair , and then she went to bed . " will it ever be tidy again ? " said poor mrs . tittlemouse . next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight . she swept , and scrubbed , and dusted ; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax , and polished her little tin spoons . when it was all beautifully neat and clean , she gave a party to five other little mice , without mr . jackson . he smelt the party and came up the bank , but he could not squeeze in at the door .
