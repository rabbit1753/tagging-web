he went down to his wife , and sat down in a chair , and gave a groan , and the chair broke in pieces . " it is the son of a king under spells you are , " said his wife , " and you had better have taken my counsel than that the spells should be on you . " he said to her to bring news of the death of anshgayliacht and the sword of light to the slender red champion . " go out , " said she , " in the morning of the morrow , and take the bridle in the window and shake it . whatever beast , handsome or ugly , puts the head in it , take that one with you . do not speak a word to her till she speaks to you . take with you three pint bottles of ale and three sixpenny loaves , and do the thing she tells you . when she runs to my father 's land , on a height above the court , she will shake herself , and the bells will ring , and my father will say brown allree is in the land . and if the son of a king or queen is there , bring him to me on your shoulders . if it is the son of a poor man , let him come no further . " he rose in the morning , and took the bridle that was in the window and went out and shook it , and brown allree came and put her head in it . and he took the three loaves and three bottles of ale , and went riding . when he was riding , she bent her head down to take hold of her feet with her mouth , in hopes he would speak in ignorance . he spoke not a word during the time , and the mare at last spoke to him , and said to him to dismount and give her her dinner . he gave her the sixpenny loaf toasted and a bottle of ale to drink . " sit up , now , riding and take good heed of yourself : there are three miles of fire i have to clear at a leap . "
