" that may be as may be , " said the swan maiden . " for listen ! i serve the witch with three eyes . she lives on the glass hill that lies beyond the seven high mountains , the seven deep valleys , and the seven wide rivers ; are you man enough to go that far ? " " oh , yes , " said the prince , " i am man enough for that and more too . " " that is good , " said the swan maiden , and thereupon she jumped down from the pear - tree to the earth . then she became a swan again , and bade the king 's son to mount upon her back at the roots of her wings . when he had done as she had told him , she sprang into the air and flew away , bearing him with her . on flew the swan , and on and on , until , by and by , she said , " what do you see , king 's son ? " " i see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me , but nothing else , " said he . after that they flew on and on again , until , at last , the swan maiden said , " what do you see now , king 's son ? " " i see the grey sky above me and the dark earth below me , but nothing else , " said he .
