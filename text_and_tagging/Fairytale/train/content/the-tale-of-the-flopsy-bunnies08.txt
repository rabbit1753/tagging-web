and mr . mcgregor was very angry too . one of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window , and hit the youngest flopsy bunny . it was rather hurt . then benjamin and flopsy thought that it was time to go home . so mr . mcgregor did not get his tobacco , and mrs . mcgregor did not get her rabbit skins . but next christmas thomasina tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit - wool to make herself a cloak and a hood , and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens .
