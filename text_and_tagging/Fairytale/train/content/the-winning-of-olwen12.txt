then arthur summoned his five best men and bade them go with kilweh . there was bedwyr the one - handed , kai 's comrade and brother in arms , the swiftest man in britain save arthur ; there was kynddelig , who knew the paths in a land where he had never been as surely as he did those of his own country ; there was gwrhyr , that could speak all tongues ; and gwalchmai the son of gwyar , who never returned till he had gained what he sought ; and last of all there was menw , who could weave a spell over them so that none might see them , while they could see everyone . so these seven journeyed together till they reached a vast open plain in which was a fair castle . but though it seemed so close it was not until the evening of the third day that they really drew near to it , and in front of it a flock of sheep was spread , so many in number that there seemed no end to them . a shepherd stood on a mound watching over them , and by his side was a dog , as large as a horse nine winters old .
