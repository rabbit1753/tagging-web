then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them . she set up her simple wooden spinning - wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs . in the intervals of her work she directed the little girl 's games and taught her to read the old stories of her country . thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband 's absence . while the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home , the husband finished his business and returned . it would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him . he had traveled day after day , exposed to all weathers , for about a month altogether , and was sunburnt to bronze . but his fond wife and child knew him at a glance , and flew to meet him from either side , each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting . both the man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well . it seemed a very long time to all till - the mother and child helping - his straw sandals were untied , his large umbrella hat taken off , and he was again in their midst in the old familiar sitting - room that had been so empty while he was away .
