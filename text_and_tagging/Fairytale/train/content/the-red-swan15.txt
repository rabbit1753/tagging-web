it removed itself , and the old man added to maidwa : " my grandchild , feed yourself ; " handing him at the same time a dish and ladle of the same ware as the pot itself . the young man , whose hunger was very great , helped himself to all that was in the pot . he felt ashamed to think that he had done so , but before he could speak the old man said : " eat , nay grandchild . eat , eat ! " and soon after he again said--"help yourself from the pot . " maidwa was surprised , on dipping in his ladle , to see that it was full . although he emptied it a second time , it was still again filled and refilled till his hunger was entirely satisfied . the old man then observed , without raising his voice : " the pot will return to its corner ; " and the pot took itself off to its accustomed place in an out - of - the - way corner of the lodge . maidwa observed that the old man was about to address him , and took an attitude which showed that he was prepared to listen .
