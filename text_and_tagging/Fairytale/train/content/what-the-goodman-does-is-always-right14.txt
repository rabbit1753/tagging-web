" but i changed away the sheep for a goose . " " then we shall have roast goose to eat this year . you dear old man , you are always thinking of something to please me . this is delightful . we can let the goose walk about with a string tied to her leg , so that she will get fatter still before we roast her . " " but i gave away the goose for a fowl . " " a fowl ! well , that was a good exchange , " replied the woman . " the fowl will lay eggs and hatch them , and we shall have chickens . we shall soon have a poultry yard . oh , this is just what i was wishing for ! "
