in a country , far across the sea , there once dwelt a great and mighty prince . he lived in a grand castle , which was full of beautiful furniture , and curious and rare ornaments . and among them was a lovely little glass shoe , which would only fit the tiniest foot imaginable . and as the prince was looking at it one day , it struck him what a dainty little lady she would need to be who wore such a very small shoe . and , as he liked dainty people , he made up his mind that he would never marry until he found a maiden who could wear the shoe , and that , when he found her , he would ask her to be his wife . and he called all his lords and courtiers to him , and told them of the determination that he had come to , and asked them to help him in his quest .
