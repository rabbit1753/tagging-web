" try and know them again , " said the man , " for the fifty young girls are in this house , and this woman beside me is their mistress , dechtire . it was they themselves , changed into birds , that went to emain macha to bring you here . " then dechtire gave bricriu a purple cloak with gold fringes . he went back to find his companions . but while he was going he thought to himself , " conchubar would give great treasure to find these fifty young girls again , and his sister along with them . i will not tell him i have found them . i will only say i have found a house with beautiful women in it , and no more than that . " when conchubar saw bricriu he asked news of him . " what news do you bring back with you , bricriu ? " he said . " i came to a fine well - lighted house , " said bricriu . " i saw a queen , noble , kind , with royal looks , with curled hair . i saw a troop of women , beautiful , well dressed . i saw the man of the house , tall and open - handed and shining . " " let us go there for the night , " said conchubar . so they brought their chariots and their horses and their arms . they were hardly in the house when every sort of food and of drink , some they knew and some they did not know , was put before them , so that they never spent a better night . and when they had eaten and drunk and began to be satisfied , conchubar said to the young man , " where is the mistress of the house that she does not come to bid us welcome ? " " you can not see her to - night , " said he , " for she is in the pains of childbirth . "
