as he was returning on his homeward way he came to the high pass of the usui toge , and here he stood and gazed at the wonderful prospect beneath him . the country , from this great elevation , all lay open to his sight , a vast panorama of mountain and plain and forest , with rivers winding like silver ribbons through the land ; then far off he saw the distant sea , which shimmered like a luminous mist in the great distance , where ototachibana had given her life for him , and as he turned towards it he stretched out his arms , and thinking of her love which he had scorned and his faithlessness to her , his heart burst out into a sorrowful and bitter cry : " azuma , azuma , ya ! " ( oh ! my wife , my wife ! ) and to this day there is a district in tokio called azuma , which commemorates the words of prince yamato take , and the place where his faithful wife leapt into the sea to save him is still pointed out . so , though in life the princess ototachibana was unhappy , history keeps her memory green , and the story of her unselfishness and heroic death will never pass away .
