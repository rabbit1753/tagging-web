" now get upon the earth bank , " said the wise woman . " come and look out over the highway , where you can see the people . " " what a crowd it is ! " said the young man . " one story after another . it whirls and whirls ! it 's quite a confusion before my eyes . i shall go out at the back . " " no , go straight forward , " said the woman . " go straight into the crowd of people . look at them in the right way . have an ear to hear and the right heart to feel , and you will soon invent something . but , before you go away , you must give me my spectacles and my ear - trumpet again .
