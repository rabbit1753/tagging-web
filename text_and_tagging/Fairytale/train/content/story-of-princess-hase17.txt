great indeed was hase - hime 's fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her what was required of her . heavy , indeed , was the duty that was laid on her young shoulders - that of saving the emperor 's life by the merit of her verse . at last the day came and her poem was finished . it was written on a leaflet of paper heavily flecked with gold - dust . with her father and attendants and some of the court officials , she proceeded to the bank of the roaring torrent and raising up her heart to heaven , she read the poem she had composed , aloud , lifting it heavenwards in her two hands . strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round . the waters ceased their roaring , and the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer . after this the emperor soon recovered his health . his majesty was highly pleased , and sent for her to the palace and rewarded her with the rank of chinjo - that of lieutenant - general - to distinguish her . from that time she was called chinjo - hime , or the lieutenant - general princess , and respected and loved by all .
