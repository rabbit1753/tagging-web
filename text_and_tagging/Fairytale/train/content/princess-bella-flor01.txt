once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons . when they grew up the elder went to seek his fortune in a far country , and for many years no one heard anything about him . meanwhile the younger son stayed at home with his father , who died at last in a good old age , leaving great riches behind him . for some time the son who stayed at home spent his father 's wealth freely , believing that he alone remained to enjoy it . but , one day , as he was coming down stairs , he was surprised to see a stranger enter the hall , looking about as if the house belonged to him .
