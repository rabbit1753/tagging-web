one beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well - filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle . he was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life . ' after all , ' it said , ' what good can i do you ? i am so young and small , and i would so gladly live a little longer . be merciful and set me free , and i shall know how to prove my gratitude . ' now uraschimataro was very good - natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea .
