there was a trembling in the poor creature 's hand , and he was not able to cut a piece at all off the bull , after his feeding him for so long , and after the kindness he had got from him . the bracket bull spoke again , and told him to cut the strip off him on the instant , and that it would assist him as long as he would be alive . he cut a strip off the back then , and another strip off the belly , and he went away . there was plenty of trouble and of grief on him , going of him , and he ought to have that on him too , and he departing without any knowledge of where he was making for , or where he would go . a gentleman met him on the road , and asked him where he was going . the lad said that he did not himself know where he was going , but that he was going looking for work . " what are you able to do ? " says the gentleman . " i 'm as good a herd as ever you saw , but i 'll not tell you a lie -- i can do nothing but herding ; but , indeed , i 'll do that as well as any man that ever you saw . " " it 's you i want , " says the gentleman . " there are three giants up by my land , on the one mearing with me , and anything that will go in on their land they will keep it , and i can not take it off them again . that 's all they 're asking -- my cattle to go in across the mearing to them . " " never mind them . i 'll go bail that i 'll take good heed of them , and that i 'll not let anything in to them . "
