when at last maidwa was about to leave , he invited a number of the families of the chief to go with him and visit their hunting - grounds , where he promised them that they would find game in abundance . they consented , and in the morning a large company assembled and joined maidwa ; and the chief , with a party of warriors , escorted them a long distance . when ready to return , the chief made a speech and besought the blessing of the good spirit on maidwa and his friends . they parted , each on its course , making music with their war - drums , which could be heard from afar as they glittered with waving feathers in the morning sun , in their march over the prairie , which was lost in the distant sky . after several days ' travel , maidwa and his friends came in sight of his home . the others rested within the woods while he went alone in advance to see his brothers .
