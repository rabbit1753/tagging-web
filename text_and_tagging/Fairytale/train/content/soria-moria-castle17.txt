toward evening he came to a green hill on which stood a large tree , beneath which he seated himself . he turned the horse loose , yet did not lie down to sleep , but took out his knapsack instead . when day came he wandered on again , for it seemed to him as though there were no place in which he could rest . he walked and rode all day long through a great forest , in which were many green clearings , that shimmered cheerfully among the trees . he did not know where he was , nor did he know whither he was going ; but he allowed himself no more time to rest than his horse needed to feed in one of the green clearings , and himself to eat from his knapsack . he walked and rode , on and on , and thought the forest would never end .
