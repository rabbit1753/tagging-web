there were once five - and - twenty tin soldiers , who were all brothers , for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon . they shouldered arms and looked straight before them , and wore a splendid uniform , red and blue . the first thing in the world they ever heard were the words , " tin soldiers ! " uttered by a little boy , who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box , in which they lay , was taken off . they were given him for a birthday present , and he stood at the table to set them up . the soldiers were all exactly alike , excepting one , who had only one leg ; he had been left to the last , and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him , so they made him to stand firmly on one leg , and this caused him to be very remarkable .
