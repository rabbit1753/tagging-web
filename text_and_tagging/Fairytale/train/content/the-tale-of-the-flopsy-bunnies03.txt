the little flopsy bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun . from the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine . the blue - bottles buzzed about the wall , and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots . ( i can tell you her name , she was called thomasina tittlemouse , a woodmouse with a long tail . ) she rustled across the paper bag , and awakened benjamin bunny . the mouse apologized profusely , and said that she knew peter rabbit . while she and benjamin were talking , close under the wall , they heard a heavy tread above their heads ; and suddenly mr . mcgregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping flopsy bunnies ! benjamin shrank down under his paper bag . the mouse hid in a jam pot .
