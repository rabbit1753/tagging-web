' bow - wow ! ' barked the yard - dog . ' they used to say i was a pretty little fellow ; then i lay in a velvet - covered chair in my master 's house . my mistress used to nurse me , and kiss and fondle me , and call me her dear , sweet little alice ! but by - and - by i grew too big , and i was given to the housekeeper , and i went into the kitchen . you can see into it from where you are standing ; you can look at the room in which i was master , for so i was when i was with the housekeeper . of course it was a smaller place than upstairs , but it was more comfortable , for i was n't chased about and teased by the children as i had been before . my food was just as good , or even better . i had my own pillow , and there was a stove there , which at this time of year is the most beautiful thing in the world . i used to creep right under that stove . ah me ! i often dream of that stove still ! bow - wow !
