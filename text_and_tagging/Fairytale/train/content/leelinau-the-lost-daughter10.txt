on the eve of the day fixed for her marriage , leelinau decked herself in her best garments . she arranged her hair according to the fashion of her tribe , and put on all of her maiden ornaments in beautiful array . with a smile , she presented herself before her parents . " i am going , " she said , " to meet my little lover , the chieftain of the green plume , who is waiting for me at the spirit grove . " her face was radiant with joy , and the parents , taking what she had said as her own fanciful way of expressing acquiescence in their plans , wished her good fortune in the happy meeting . " i am going , " she continued , addressing her mother as they left the lodge , " i am going from one who has watched my infancy and guarded my youth ; who has given me medicine when i was sick , and prepared my food when i was well . i am going from a father who has ranged the forest to procure the choicest skins for my dress , and kept his lodge supplied with the best spoil of the chase . i am going from a lodge which has been my shelter from the storms of winter , and my shield from the heats of summer . farewell , my parents , farewell ! " so saying , she sped faster than any could follow her to the margin of the fairy wood , and in a moment was lost to sight . as she had often thus withdrawn herself from the lodge , the parents were not in fear , but confidently awaited her return . hour chased hour , as the clouds of evening rolled up in the west ; darkness came on , but no daughter returned .
