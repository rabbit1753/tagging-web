the wolf , the bear , and the wild boar arrived on the spot first , and when they had waited some time for the fox , the dog , and the cat , the bear said , ' i 'll climb up into the oak tree , and look if i can see them coming . ' the first time he looked round he said , ' i can see nothing . ' the second time he looked round he said , ' i can still see nothing . ' but the third time he said , ' i see a mighty army in the distance , and one of the warriors has the biggest lance you ever saw ! ' this was the cat , who was marching along with her tail erect .
