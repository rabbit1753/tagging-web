' more wood , ' cried guddhi , and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped it on the flames , which leaped and roared and sputtered . ' we shall soon be warm now , ' said the people one to another . ' truly guddhu is great ' ; and they crowded round again , closer and closer . suddenly , with a shriek , a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out towards them . they sprang back hurriedly , quite forgetting where they stood , and all fell down the bank , each tumbling over the other , till they rolled into the pool that lay below . oh , how cold it was in that dark water on which the sun never shone ! then in an instant they felt warm again , for the fire , driven by the strong wind , had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool , where it burned as brightly as ever . and the fishes gathered round it as they had done on the top of the cliff , and found the flames as hot as before , and that fire never went out , like those upon land , but kept burning for ever . so now you know why , if you dive deep down below the cold surface of the water on a frosty day , you will find it comfortable and pleasant underneath , and be quite sorry that you can not stay there .
