" would you like to have some cake , little white cat ? " said one of the trolls , and threw a burning hot , roasted frog into the bear 's jaws . " thump them , master bruin ! " cried per gynt . and the bear grew so angry that he rushed on the trolls , raining blows on every side and scratching them . and per gynt hewed into the crowd with his other wagon - spoke as though he meant to break their skulls . then the trolls had to make themselves scarce , but per gynt remained , and feasted on the christmas fare all of christmas week , while for many a long year no more was heard of the trolls .
