he kissed her for the last time , and was off the next minute , walking as fast as he could . she shouted after him , and then seeing there was no use , she dressed herself and pursued him . he never stopped , nor stayed , nor looked back , and still she kept him in sight ; and when he was on the hill she was in the hollow , and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill . her life was almost leaving her , when , just as the sun was setting , he turned up a lane , and went into a little house . she crawled up after him , and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy on his knees , and he kissing and hugging him .
