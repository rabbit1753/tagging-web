mr . mcgregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall . he went to put away the mowing machine . while he was gone , mrs . flopsy bunny ( who had remained at home ) came across the field . she looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was ? then the mouse came out of her jam pot , and benjamin took the paper bag off his head , and they told the doleful tale . benjamin and flopsy were in despair , they could not undo the string . but mrs . tittlemouse was a resourceful person . she nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack .
