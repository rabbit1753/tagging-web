blow , winds , blow ! my sister lingers for her dwelling in the sky , where the morn , with rosy fingers , shall her cheeks with vermil dye . there my earliest views directed , shall from her their color take , and her smiles , through clouds reflected , guide me on by wood or lake . while i range the highest mountains , sport in valleys green and low , or , beside our indian fountains , raise my tiny hip - hallo . presently the winds blew , and , as dais - imid had predicted , his sister was borne by them to the eastern sky , where she has ever since lived , and her name is now the morning star .
