" but must we not all here on earth give up our best parts to others , and offer as much as lies in our power ? it is true , i have only given roses . but you -- you who are so richly endowed -- what have you given to the world ? what will you give it ? " " what have i given ? what am i going to give ? i spit at it ; it 's good for nothing , and does not concern me . for my part , you may go on bearing roses ; you can not do anything else . let the hazel bush bear nuts , and the cows and sheep give milk ; they have each their public . i have mine in myself . i retire within myself and there i stop . the world is nothing to me . " with this the snail withdrew into his house and blocked up the entrance .
