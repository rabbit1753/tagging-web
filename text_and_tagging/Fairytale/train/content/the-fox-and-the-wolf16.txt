when he was finished , he put down his paw and , turning to the fox , looked at him keenly ; for all at once it struck him that his fur looked sleek and fine . " it is your turn now , " he said . " i have sworn , and you must do so also . " the fox 's face fell at these words , for although he was both untruthful and dishonest now , he had been well brought up in his youth , and he knew that it was a terrible thing to perjure oneself and swear falsely . so he made one excuse after another , but the wolf , who was getting more and more suspicious every moment , would not listen to him . so , as he had not courage to tell the truth , he was forced at last to swear an oath also , and this was what he swore : " if it be that i stole the butter ; if it be , if it be-- then let some most deadly punishment fall on me , fall on me-- whirrum wheeckam , whirrum wheeckam , whirram whee , whirram whee ! "
