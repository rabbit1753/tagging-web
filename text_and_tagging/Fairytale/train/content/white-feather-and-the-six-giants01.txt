there was an old man living in the depth of a forest , with his grandson , whom he had taken in charge when quite an infant . the child had no parents , brothers , or sisters ; they had all been destroyed by six large giants , and he had been informed that he had no other relative living beside his grandfather . the band to whom he had belonged had put up their children on a wager in a race against those of the giants , and had thus lost them . there was an old tradition in the tribe , that , one day , it would produce a great man , who would wear a white feather , and who would astonish every one by his feats of skill and bravery . the grandfather , as soon as the child could play about , gave him a bow and arrows to amuse himself with . he went into the edge of the woods one day , and saw a rabbit ; but not knowing what it was , he ran home and described it to his grandfather . he told him what it was , that its flesh was good to eat , and that if he would shoot one of his arrows into its body he would kill it .
