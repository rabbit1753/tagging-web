in the morning per gynt went out hunting . when he had made his way far into the fjoll , he saw a girl driving sheep and goats across a mountain - top . but when he reached the top of the mountain , the girl had vanished , as well as her flock , and all he saw was a great pack of bears . " never yet have i seen bears run together in packs , " thought per gynt . but when he came nearer , they all disappeared save one alone . then a voice called from a nearby hill : " guard your boar , for understand , per gynt is without , with his firelock in his hand ! "
