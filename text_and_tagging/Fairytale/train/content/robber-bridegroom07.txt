she began to make excuses , and said she could not find the way to it ; but the bridegroom said , " you must come and pay me a visit next sunday ; i have already invited company , and i will strew ashes on the path through the wood , so that you will be sure to find it . " when sunday came , and the girl set out on her way , she felt very uneasy without knowing exactly why ; and she filled both pockets full of peas and lentils . there were ashes strewed on the path through the wood , but , nevertheless , at each step she cast to the right and left a few peas on the ground . so she went on the whole day until she came to the middle of the wood , where it was the darkest , and there stood a lonely house , not pleasant in her eyes , for it was dismal and unhomelike . she walked in , but there was no one there , and the greatest stillness reigned . suddenly she heard a voice cry , " turn back , turn back , thou pretty bride , within this house thou must not bide , for here do evil things betide . " when the bride heard that , she came from behind the cask , and had to make her way among the sleepers lying all about on the ground , and she felt very much afraid lest she might awaken any of them . but by good luck she passed through , and the old woman with her , and they opened the door , and they made all haste to leave that house of murderers . the wind had carried away the ashes from the path , but the peas and lentils had budded and sprung up , and the moonshine upon them showed the way . and they went on through the night , till in the morning they reached the mill . then the girl related to her father all that had happened to her .
