he passed over the river , and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships . he passed over the ghetto , and saw the old jews bargaining with each other , and weighing out money in copper scales . at last he came to the poor house and looked in . the boy was tossing feverishly on his bed , and the mother had fallen asleep , she was so tired . in he hopped , and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman 's thimble . then he flew gently round the bed , fanning the boy 's forehead with his wings . " how cool i feel , " said the boy , " i must be getting better " ; and he sank into a delicious slumber . then the swallow flew back to the happy prince , and told him what he had done . " it is curious , " he remarked , " but i feel quite warm now , although it is so cold . " " that is because you have done a good action , " said the prince . and the little swallow began to think , and then he fell asleep . thinking always made him sleepy .
