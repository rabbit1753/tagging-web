long before this speech was ended the young man had turned to the quarter from which the voice proceeded , and he was astonished to behold a man ; for as yet he had never seen any human being beside his grandfather . as he looked more keenly , he saw that this man , who had the looks of great age , was wood from the breast downward , and that he appeared to be fixed in the earth . as his eye dwelt upon this strange being , the countenance by degrees faded away , and when he advanced to the spot whence it had addressed him , it was gone . he returned home ; slept ; in the midst of his slumbers , as from the hollow of the air , heard the voice ; wakened and found the promised gifts . his grandfather , when his attention was called to his awakening , was greatly surprised to find the youth with a white feather on his forehead , and to see flocks of pigeons flying out of his lodge . he then remembered the old tradition , and knowing that now the day when he should lose control of his charge had begun , he bitterly bewailed the hour . possessed of his three magic gifts , the young man departed the next morning , to seek his enemies , and to demand revenge .
