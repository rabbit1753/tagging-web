" and he once more sat down on a stone , in order to wash his armlet . then the crystal castle of the dragon began to tremble as though it were about to fall apart . and a watchman also came and reported that the triton had been slain by a boy . so the dragon - king sent out his son to capture the boy . and the son seated himself on the water - cleaving beast , and came up with a thunder of great waves of water . notscha straightened up and said : " that is a big wave ! " suddenly he saw a creature rise out of the waves , on whose back sat an armed man who cried in a loud voice : " who has slain my triton ? " notscha answered : " the triton wanted to slay me so i killed him . what difference does it make ? " then the dragon assailed him with his halberd .
