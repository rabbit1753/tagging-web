in the centre of the large apartment a great troop of fairies , elves , and sprites were dancing reels as hard as they could to the music of a tiny set of bagpipes . they were being played by a brown - faced gnome , who sat on a ledge of rock far above their heads . they all stopped their various employments when farquhar came suddenly down in their midst . they looked at him in alarm . when they saw that he was not hurt , they bowed gravely and bade him be seated . then they went on with their work and with their play as if nothing had happened . but farquhar , being very fond of dancing , and being in no wise anxious to be seated , thought that he would like to have a reel first . he asked the fairies if he might join them . and they , although they looked surprised at his request , allowed him to do so . in a few minutes the young man was dancing away as gaily as any of them .
