the girl glanced round , and perceived that the voice came from a bird who was hanging in a cage by the wall . and again it cried , " turn back , turn back , thou pretty bride , within this house thou must not bide , for here do evil things betide . " then the pretty bride went on from one room into another through the whole house , but it was quite empty , and no soul to be found in it . at last she reached the cellar , and there sat a very old woman nodding her head . " can you tell me , " said the bride , " if my bridegroom lives here ? " " oh , poor child , " answered the old woman , " do you know what has happened to you ? you are in a place of cut - throats . you thought you were a bride , and soon to be married , but death will be your spouse . look here , i have a great kettle of water to set on , and when once they have you in their power they will cut you in pieces without mercy , cook you , and eat you , for they are cannibals . unless i have pity on you , and save you , all is over with you !
