once upon a time there was a man who had a cat , and she ate so very much that he did not want to keep her any longer . so he decided to tie a stone around her neck , and throw her into the river ; but before he did so she was to have something to eat just once more . the woman offered her a dish of mush and a little potful of fat . these she swallowed , and then jumped out of the window . there stood the man on the threshing - floor .
