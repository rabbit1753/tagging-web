" " i was very disappointed , " said watanabe , " that i was not able take the monster captive , which was what i wished to do , instead of only cutting off an arm ! " " i am very proud to think , " answered the old woman , " that my master was so brave as to dare to cut off an ogre 's arm . there is nothing that can be compared to your courage . before i die it is the great wish of my life to see this arm , " she added pleadingly .
