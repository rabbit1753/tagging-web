but all her care was in vain . another evening , when they were all so happy , and the prince dandling the baby , a beautiful greyhound stood before them , took the child out of the father 's hand , and was out of the door before you could wink . this time she shouted and ran out of the room , but there were some of the servants in the next room , and all declared that neither child nor dog passed out . she felt , somehow , as if it was her husband 's fault , but still she kept command over herself , and did n't once reproach him . when the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door to be left open for a moment ; but she was n't the nearer to keep the child to herself . they were sitting one evening by the fire , when a lady appeared standing by them . the princess opened her eyes in a great fright and stared at her , and while she was doing so , the lady wrapped a shawl round the baby that was sitting in its father 's lap , and either sank through the ground with it or went up through the wide chimney . this time the mother kept her bed for a month .
