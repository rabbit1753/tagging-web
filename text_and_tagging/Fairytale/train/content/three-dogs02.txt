some time afterward god gave the royal pair another little daughter , and again the whole kingdom rejoiced . but the wise old woman once more put in an appearance , and warned the king not to let the princess out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age . and then , after a time , god gave the royal pair a third daughter . this time , too , the old woman appeared , and repeated what she had already twice said . then the king was much grieved ; for he loved his children above everything in the world . therefore he gave strict orders that the three princesses were always to be kept beneath the roof of the castle , and that none were to dare transgress against this command .
