of course the king and queen would have preferred a daughter - in - law with two hands , and one who could have brought riches with her , but they could not bear to say ' no ' to their son , so they told him it should be as he chose , and that the wedding feast should be prepared immediately . the girl could scarcely believe her good fortune , and , in gratitude for all the kindness shown her , was so useful and pleasant to her husband 's parents that they soon loved her . by and bye a baby was born to her , and soon after that the prince was sent on a journey by his father to visit some of the distant towns of the kingdom , and to set right things that had gone wrong . no sooner had he started than the girl 's brother , who had wasted all the riches his wife had brought him in recklessness and folly , and was now very poor , chanced to come into the town , and as he passed he heard a man say , ' do you know that the king 's son has married a woman who has lost one of her hands ? ' on hearing these words the brother stopped and asked , ' where did he find such a woman ? ' ' in the forest , ' answered the man , and the cruel brother guessed at once it must be his sister . in this manner many weeks passed by . and what was the prince doing ? well , he had fallen very ill when he was on the furthest border of the kingdom , and he was nursed by some kind people who did not know who he was , so that the king and queen heard nothing about him . when he was better he made his way home again , and into his father 's palace , where he found a strange man standing behind the throne with the peacock 's feathers . this was his wife 's brother , whom the king had taken into high favour , though , of course , the prince was quite ignorant of what had happened . for a moment the king and queen stared at their son , as if he had been unknown to them ; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that his shoulders were bowed like those of an old man .
