maidwa thought that the old man did not know that he was standing near the door . in this he was mistaken . without turning his eyes to look at him , the old man said , " walk in , my grandchild . take a seat opposite to me , and take off your things and dry them , for you must be fatigued . i will prepare you something to eat , and you shall have something very delicate . " maidwa accepted this kind invitation , and entered the lodge . the old man then remarked , as if in mere course of conversation : " my kettle with water stands near the fire . " immediately a small earthen pot with legs appeared by the fire . he then took one grain of corn , also one of whortleberry , and put them in the pot . maidwa was very hungry , and seeing the limited scale of the old man 's housekeeping , he thought his chance for a supper was very slight . the old man had promised him something very delicate , and he seemed likely to keep his word . maidwa looked on silently , and did not change his face any more than if the greatest banquet that was ever spread had been going forward . the pot soon boiled , when the old man said in a very quiet way : " the pot will stand at a distance from the fire .
