the little old woman who makes war was in an excellent humor , and she received strong desire with rejoicing . she admired his prudence , and assured him his bravery should never be questioned again . lifting up the head , which she gazed upon with vast delight , she said he need only have brought the scalp . cutting off a lock of the hair for herself , she told him he might now return with the head , which would be evidence of an achievement that would cause his own people to respect him . " in your way home , " added the little old woman , " you will meet with but one difficulty . maunkahkeesh , the spirit of the earth , requires an offering or sacrifice from all of her sons who perform extraordinary deeds . as you walk along in a prairie there will be an earthquake ; the earth will open and divide the prairie in the middle . take this partridge and throw it into the opening , and instantly spring over it . " with many thanks to the little old witch , who had so faithfully befriended him , strong desire took leave of her , and having , by the course pointed out , safely passed the earthquake , he arrived near his own village . he secretly hid his precious trophy .
