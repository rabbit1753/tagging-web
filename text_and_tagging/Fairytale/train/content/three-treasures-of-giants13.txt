oh , what a good supper jack had that night , quite forgetting that he owed it to a mean trick . the next day he breakfasted early , and then walked on towards the nearest town . on the way thither he met another old man , who begged for something to eat . ' certainly , you shall have something to eat , ' replied jack . and , placing the table on the ground he cried : ' the dinner of an emperor ! ' when all sorts of food dishes appeared . at first the old man ate quite greedily , and said nothing ; but , after his hunger was satisfied , he turned to jack and said : ' that is a very clever trick of yours . give the table to me and you shall have something still better . ' ' i do n't believe that there is anything better , ' answered jack . ' yes , there is . here is my bag ; it will give you as many castles as you can possibly want . '
