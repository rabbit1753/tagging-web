i was afraid the woman would see me , as she was asking the child where he saw me , and he said i was up in a tree . the more the child called me , the more i hid myself . the woman took the child home with her , but i knew he would be up early in the morning . i went to the parlour window , and the child was within , and he playing . when he saw me , he cried out , " oh , my heart 's love , come here till i see you , shaggy papa . " i broke the window , and went in , and he began to kiss me . i saw the rod in front of the chimney , and i jumped up at the rod and knocked it down . " oh , my heart 's love , no one would give me the pretty rod . " i thought he would strike me with the rod , but he did not . when i saw the time was short , i raised my paw , and i gave him a scratch below the knee . " oh , you naughty , dirty , shaggy papa ! you have hurt me so much -- i'll give yourself a blow of the rod . " he struck me a light blow , and as there was no sin on him , i came back to my own shape again . when he saw a man standing before him he gave a cry , and i took him up in my arms . the servants heard the child . a maid came in to see what was the matter with him . when she saw me she gave a cry out of her , and she said , " oh , my soul to god , if the master is n't come to life again . " another came in , and said it was he , really . and when the mistress heard of it , she came to see with her own eyes , for she would not believe i was there . when she saw me she said she 'd drown herself . and i said to her , " if you yourself will keep the secret , no living man will ever get the story from me until i lose my head . " many 's the man has come asking for the story , and i never let one return ; but now everyone will know it , but she is as much to blame as i. i gave you my head on the spot , and a thousand welcomes , and she can not say i have been telling anything but the truth .
