there was a track of fire behind it . finn followed , and on the threshold of the enchanted palace he found the body of midna . he was quite dead , with the blood pouring through a wound in the middle of his back ; but the spear was gone . finn drew his sword and cut off the enchanter 's head , and returned with it to tara . when he came to the spot where he had dropped the mantle it was not seen , but smoke and flame issued there from a hole in the ground . that hole was twenty feet deep in the earth , and at the bottom of it there was a fire always from that night , and it was never extinguished . it was called the fire of the son of midna . it was in a depression on the north side of the hill of tara , called the glen of the mantle , glen - a - brat .
