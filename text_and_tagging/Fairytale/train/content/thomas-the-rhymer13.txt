and the second road was as different from the first as it well could be . it was narrow , and winding , and long ; and there was a thorn hedge on one side of it , and a briar hedge on the other ; and those hedges grew so high , and their branches were so wild and tangled , that those who were travelling along that road would have some difficulty in persevering on their journey at all . and the third road was unlike any of the others . it was a bonnie , bonnie road , winding up a hillside among brackens , and heather , and golden - yellow whins , and it looked as if it would be pleasant travelling , to pass that way . " now , " said the fairy queen , " and thou wilt , i shall tell thee where these three roads lead to . the first road , as thou seest , is broad , and even , and easy , and there be many that choose it to travel on . but though it be a good road , it leadeth to a bad end , and the folk that choose it repent their choice for ever .
