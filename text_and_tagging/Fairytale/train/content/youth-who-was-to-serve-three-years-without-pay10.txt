there was no need to urge the young folk . they ate and drank and enjoyed themselves , and then slept far into the next day . the youth was still asleep when the old man came and offered him a morning draft in a golden goblet . and when he had put on his rags and breakfasted , he was allowed to pick out what he wanted , as a reward for delivering the prince . there was much to see and still more to take , as you may believe . " well , what do you want ? " asked the king . " you may take what you will ; for as you see there is enough from which to choose . " the youth said he would have to think it over a bit , and speak to the prince . and that he was allowed to do . " well , i suppose you have seen all sorts of beautiful things ? " asked the prince . " that is a fact , " said the youth . " but tell me , what ought i to choose among all these magnificent things ? your father said i might pick out whatever i wished . " " you must choose none among all the things you have seen , " answered the prince , " but my father wears a ring on his little finger , and you must ask him for that . " this the youth did , and begged the king for the ring on his finger . " it is dearer to me than anything else i have , " said the king , " but my son is just as dear to me , and therefore i will give you the ring . do you know what powers it has ? " no , that the youth did not know . " while you wear it on your finger , you can get everything that you want to have , " said the king . the youth thanked him most kindly , and the king and the prince wished him all manner of luck on his journey , and charged him to take the best care of the ring .
