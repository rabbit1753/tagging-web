one day he sallied forth in search of adventures , for he had the nature of a warrior and could not bear to be idle . so he buckled on his two swords , took his huge bow , much taller than himself , in his hand , and slinging his quiver on his back started out . he had not gone far when he came to the bridge of seta - no - karashi spanning one end of the beautiful lake biwa . no sooner had he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent - dragon . its body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole width of the bridge . one of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge , while its tail lay right against the other . the monster seemed to be asleep , and as it breathed , fire and smoke came out of its nostrils .
