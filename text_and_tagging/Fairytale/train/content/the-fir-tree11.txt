but when did that happen ? well , it was one morning when they came to tidy up the lumber - room ; they threw it really rather roughly on the floor , but a servant dragged it off at once downstairs , where there was daylight once more . ' now life begins again ! ' thought the tree . it felt the fresh air , the first rays of the sun , and there it was out in the yard ! everything passed so quickly ; the tree quite forgot to notice itself , there was so much to look at all around . the yard opened on a garden full of flowers ; the roses were so fresh and sweet , hanging over a little trellis , the lime - trees were in blossom , and the swallows flew about , saying : ' quirre - virre - vil , my husband has come home ; ' but it was not the fir - tree they meant . ' now i shall live , ' thought the tree joyfully , stretching out its branches wide ; but , alas ! they were all withered and yellow ; and it was lying in a corner among weeds and nettles . the golden star was still on its highest bough , and it glittered in the bright sunlight . in the yard some of the merry children were playing , who had danced so gaily round the tree at christmas . one of the little ones ran up , and tore off the gold star . ' look what was left on the ugly old fir - tree ! ' he cried , and stamped on the boughs so that they cracked under his feet .
