then , suddenly , up came the stork . he had seen the toad in the grass , and stooped down and seized the little creature anything but gently . the stork 's beak pinched her , and the wind whistled ; it was not exactly agreeable , but she was going upward -- upward towards egypt -- and she knew it ; and that was why her eyes gleamed , and a spark seemed to fly out of them . " quunk!--ah ! " the body was dead -- the toad was killed ! but the spark that had shot forth from her eyes ; what became of that ? the sunbeam took it up ; the sunbeam carried the jewel from the head of the toad . whither ? ask not the naturalist ; rather ask the poet . he will tell it thee under the guise of a fairy tale ; and the caterpillar on the cabbage , and the stork family belong to the story . think ! the caterpillar is changed , and turns into a beautiful butterfly ; the stork family flies over mountains and seas , to the distant africa , and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country -- to the same roof . nay , that is almost too improbable ; and yet it is true . you may ask the naturalist , he will confess it is so ; and you know it yourself , for you have seen it . but the jewel in the head of the toad ? seek it in the sun ; see it there if you can . the brightness is too dazzling there . we have not yet such eyes as can see into the glories which god has created , but we shall receive them by - and - by ; and that will be the most beautiful story of all , and we shall all have our share in it .
