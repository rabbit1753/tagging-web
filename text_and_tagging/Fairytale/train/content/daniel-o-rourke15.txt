' if you must , you must , ' said he ; ' there , take your own way ' ; and he opened his claw , and , faith , he was right -- sure enough , i came down plump into the very bottom of the salt sea ! down to the very bottom i went , and i gave myself up , then , for ever , when a whale walked up to me , scratching himself after his night 's sleep , and looked me full in the face , and never the word did he say , but , lifting up his tail , he splashed me all over again with the cold salt water till there was n't a dry stitch upon my whole carcass ! and i heard somebody saying -- it was a voice i knew too--'get up , you drunken brute , off of that ' ; and with that i woke up , and there was judy with a tub full of water , which she was splashing all over me -- for , rest her soul , though she was a good wife , she could never bear to see me in drink , and had a bitter hand of her own . ' get up , ' said she again ; ' and of all places in the parish , would no place sarve your turn to lie down upon but under the ould walls of carrigapooka ? an uneasy resting i am sure you had of it . ' and , sure enough , i had , for i was fairly bothered out of my senses with eagles , and men of the moons , and flying ganders , and whales , driving me through bogs and up to the moon , and down to the bottom of the green ocean . if i was in drink ten times over , long would it be before i 'd lie down in the same spot again , i know that !
