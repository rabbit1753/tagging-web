" the magician began to feel uneasy , for he found that he had been outwitted . he , however , put on a grave face , and entering the lodge , acted as if nothing unusual had happened . some days after this , mishosha again requested his son - in - law to accompany him . owasso , without hesitation , said " yes ! " they went out , and , in a rapid passage , they arrived at a solitary island , which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks . the magician said to owasso , " go on shore , my son , and pick up all the gulls ' eggs you can find . " the rocks were strewn with eggs , and the air resounded with the cry of the birds as they saw them gathered up by owasso . the old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls . " i have long wished , " he said , " to offer you something . i now give you this young man for food . " he then uttered the charm to his canoe , and it shot out of sight , leaving owasso to make his peace the best way he could .
