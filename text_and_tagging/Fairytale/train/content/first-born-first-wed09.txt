then she took the apple , and when she was outside the door , laid it on the ground , and it rolled and rolled , and she followed it , a long , long way , to a region unknown to her . there she came to a high garden wall , over which hung the branches of trees , loaded with beautiful fruit . finally she reached a great portal , adorned with gold and splendid ornaments , which opened of its own accord as the apple rolled up to it . and the apple rolled through the portal and the maiden followed it into the garden , which was the most beautiful she ever had seen . the apple rolled over to a low - growing tree weighed with the most magnificent apples , and there it stopped . the maiden picked all that her silken apron would hold , and turned to see from which direction she had come , and where the portal stood through which she would have to pass on her way back . but the garden was so lovely that she felt like enjoying its charms a while longer , and without thinking of the prince 's words , she touched the apple with her foot , and it began to roll again .
