but to - day , as she was looking in , what should she see but a little trout . it was swimming quietly backwards and forwards not very far from the surface . " troutie , troutie , answer me this one question , " said the queen . " am not i the most beautiful woman in the world ? " " no , indeed , you are not , " replied the trout promptly , jumping out of the water , as he spoke , in order to swallow a fly . " who is the most beautiful woman , then ? " asked the disappointed queen . she had expected a far different answer . " thy step - daughter , the princess gold - tree , without a doubt , " said the little fish . then , frightened by the black look that came upon the jealous queen 's face , he dived to the bottom of the well . it was no wonder that he did so . the queen 's expression was not pleasant to look at , as she darted an angry glance at her fair young step - daughter . she was busy picking flowers some little distance away . indeed , she was so annoyed at the thought that anyone should say that the girl was prettier than she was . she quite lost her self - control . when she reached home she went up , in a violent passion , to her room , and threw herself on the bed , declaring that she felt very ill indeed . it was in vain that princess gold - tree asked her what the matter was , and if she could do anything for her . she would not let the poor girl touch her , but pushed her away as if she had been some evil thing . so at last the princess had to leave her alone , and go out of the apartment , feeling very sad indeed .
