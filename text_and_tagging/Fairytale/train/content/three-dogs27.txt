one day while they were still underway , they met two wanderers , who were traveling the same road . the clothes of the two strangers were torn and their feet were sore , and their whole appearance showed that they had a long journey behind them . the youth stopped his wagon , and asked them who they were and whence they came . the strangers answered that they were two princes , and had gone forth to search for the three maidens in the mountain . but fortune had not favored them ; and now they had to return home more like journeymen than kings ' sons . when the youth heard this he felt sorry for the two wanderers , and asked whether they would like to ride with him in his handsome wagon . the princes thanked him profusely for his offer . they drove on together , and came to the kingdom over which the father of the princesses reigned .
