at this moment the moon burst forth from the clouds . " what will you give the old lamp ? " asked the wind . " i can give nothing , " she replied . " i am on the wane , and no lamps have ever given me light , while i have frequently shone upon them . " with these words the moon hid herself again behind the clouds , that she might be saved from further importunities . just then a drop fell upon the lamp from the roof of the house , but the drop explained that it was a gift from those gray clouds and perhaps the best of all gifts . " i shall penetrate you so thoroughly , " it said , " that you will have the power of becoming rusty , and , if you wish it , can crumble into dust in one night . " but this seemed to the lamp a very shabby present , and the wind thought so , too . " does no one give any more ? will no one give any more ? " shouted the breath of the wind , as loud as it could . then a bright , falling star came down , leaving a broad , luminous streak behind it .
