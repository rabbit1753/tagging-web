once there was a woman who had no children , and this made her very unhappy . so she spoke one day to the sunball , saying : ' dear sunball , send me only a little girl now , and when she is twelve years old you may take her back again . ' so soon after this the sunball sent her a little girl , whom the woman called letiko , and watched over with great care till she was twelve years old . soon after that , while letiko was away one day gathering herbs , the sunball came to her , and said : ' letiko , when you go home , tell your mother that she must bethink herself of what she promised me .
