but on the evening of the following day he saw something gleaming among the trees . " if the people there are still up , i could warm myself a little , and get something to eat ! " thought halvor . when he got there it was a wretched little hut , and through the window he saw an old couple sitting in it , as ancient and gray - headed as doves , and the woman had so long a nose that she used it at the hearth for a poker . " good evening ! good evening ! " said the old woman . " but what are you doing here ? no christian soul has come this way for the past hundred years . " halvor told her he was looking for soria - moria castle , and asked whether she knew the way to it . " no , " was the woman 's answer , " i do not know , but here comes the moon , i will ask him . he ought to know , for he shines on everything . " and then , when the moon rose bright and clear above the tree - tops , the woman went out . " you moon , you moon , " she cried , " can you tell me the way to soria - moria castle ? " " no , " said the moon , " i can not do that , because when i was shining there , a cloud lay in my way . "
