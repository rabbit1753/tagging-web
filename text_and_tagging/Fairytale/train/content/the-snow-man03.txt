' and one ca n't get a fellow like this in summer either , ' said the young man , pointing to the snow - man . ' he 's a beauty ! ' the girl laughed , and nodded to the snow - man , and then they both danced away over the snow . ' who were those two ? ' asked the snow - man of the yard - dog . ' you have been in this yard longer than i have . do you know who they are ? ' ' do i know them indeed ? ' answered the yard - dog . ' she has often stroked me , and he has given me bones . i do n't bite either of them ! ' ' but what are they ? ' asked the snow - man . ' lovers ! ' replied the yard - dog . ' they will go into one kennel and gnaw the same bone ! ' ' are they the same kind of beings that we are ? ' asked the snow - man . ' they are our masters , ' answered the yard - dog . ' really people who have only been in the world one day know very little . that 's the conclusion i have come to . now i have age and wisdom ; i know everyone in the house , and i can remember a time when i was not lying here in a cold kennel . bow - wow ! ' ' the cold is splendid , ' said the snow - man . ' tell me some more . but do n't rattle your chain so , it makes me crack ! '
