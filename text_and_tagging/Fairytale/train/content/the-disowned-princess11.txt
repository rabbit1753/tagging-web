" then he had food and drink brought in for his guest . when the goblet had thrice made the rounds , a gentle breeze began to murmur and a fine rain fell . a youth clad in a purple gown and wearing a lofty hat entered . a sword hung at his side . his appearance was manly and heroic . behind him walked a girl radiantly beautiful , wearing a robe of misty fragrance . and when liu i looked at her , lo , it was the dragon - princess whom he had met on his way ! a throng of maidens in rosy garments received her , laughing and giggling , and led her into the interior of the palace . the king , however , presented liu i to the youth and said : " this is tsian tang , my brother !
