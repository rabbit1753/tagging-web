so it went on for three days , and dschang liang 's patience was not exhausted . then the old man was satisfied , brought forth the book of hidden complements , and gave it to him . " you must read it , " said he , " and then you will be able to rule a great emperor . when your task is completed , seek me at the foot of the gu tschong mountain . there you will find a yellow stone , and i will be by that yellow stone . " dschang liang took the book and aided the ancestor of the han dynasty to conquer the empire . the emperor made him a count . from that time forward dschang liang ate no human food and concentrated in spirit . he kept company with the four whitebeards of the shang mountain , and with them shared the sunset roses in the clouds . once he met two boys who were singing and dancing : " green the garments you should wear , if to heaven 's gate you 'd fare ; there the golden mother greet , bow before the wood lord 's feet !
