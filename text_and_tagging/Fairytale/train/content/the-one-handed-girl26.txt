for a while she walked , not knowing whither she went , then by and bye she grew tired , and sat under a tree to rest and to hush her baby to sleep . suddenly she raised her eyes , and saw a snake wriggling from under the bushes towards her . ' i am a dead woman , ' she said to herself , and stayed quite still , for indeed she was too frightened to move . in another minute the snake had reached her side , and to her surprise he spoke . ' open your earthen pot , and let me go in . save me from sun , and i will save you from rain , ' and she opened the pot , and when the snake had slipped in , she put on the cover . soon she beheld another snake coming after the other one , and when it had reached her it stopped and said , ' did you see a small grey snake pass this way just now ? ' ' yes , ' she answered , ' it was going very quickly . ' ' ah , i must hurry and catch it up , ' replied the second snake , and it hastened on .
