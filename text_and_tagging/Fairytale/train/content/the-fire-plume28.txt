about mid - day the company began to assemble ; and such a company wassamo had never looked on before . there were spirits from all parts of the country ; such strange - looking persons , and in dresses so wild and outlandish ! one entered who smiled on him . this , wassamo was informed , was a spirit who had charge of the affairs of a tribe in the north , and he was as pleasant and cheery a spirit as one would wish to see . soon after , wassamo heard a great rumbling and roaring , as of waters tumbling over rocks ; and presently , with a vast bluster , and fairly shaking the lodge with his deep - throated hail of welcome to the old sand - spirit , in rolled another , who was the guardian spirit and special director of a great cataract or water - fall not far off .
