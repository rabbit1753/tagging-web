a prize , or rather two prizes , a great one and a small one , had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,--not in a single race , but for the whole year . " i obtained the first prize , " said the hare . " justice must still be carried out , even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee ; but that the snail should have received the second prize , i consider almost an insult to myself . " " no , " said the fence - rail , who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes ; " there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance . i have heard many respectable people say so , and i can quite understand it . the snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door ; but he injured himself , and broke his collar - bone by the haste he made . he gave himself up entirely to the race , and ran with his house on his back , which was all , of course , very praiseworthy ; and therefore he obtained the second prize .
