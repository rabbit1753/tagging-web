now i forgot to tell you that , about half a mile from where the old farmhouse stood , there was a beautiful castle , where a very rich young nobleman lived . he was both good and brave , as well as rich ; and all the mothers who had pretty daughters used to wish that he would come their way , some day , and fall in love with one of them . but he had never done so , and everyone said , " he is too grand to marry any country girl . one day he will go away to london town and marry a duke 's daughter . " well , this fine spring morning it chanced that this young nobleman 's favourite horse had lost a shoe , and he was so afraid that any of the grooms might ride it along the hard road , and not on the soft grass at the side , that he said that he would take it to the smithy himself . so it happened that he was riding along by maisie 's garden gate as her mother came into the garden singing these strange lines . he stopped his horse , and said good - naturedly , " good day , madam ; and may i ask why you sing such a strange song ? " maisie 's mother made no answer , but turned and walked into the house ; and the young nobleman , being very anxious to know what it all meant , hung his bridle over the garden gate , and followed her . she pointed to the seven hanks of thread lying on the table , and said , " this hath my daughter done before breakfast . " then the young man asked to see the maiden who was so industrious , and her mother went and pulled maisie from behind the door , where she had hidden herself when the stranger came in ; for she had come downstairs while her mother was in the garden .
