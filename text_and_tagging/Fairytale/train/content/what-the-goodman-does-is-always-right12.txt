" why , do you know-- " said our peasant , and then he told them the whole story of the horse , which he had exchanged for a cow , and all the rest of it , down to the apples . " well , your old woman will give it to you when you get home , " said one of the englishmen . " wo n't there be a noise ? " " what ! give me what ? " said the peasant . " why , she will kiss me , and say , ' what the goodman does is always right . ' " " let us lay a wager on it , " said the englishman . " we 'll wager you a ton of coined gold , a hundred pounds to the hundredweight . " " no , a bushel will be enough , " replied the peasant . " i can only set a bushel of apples against it , and i 'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain . that will pile up the measure , i fancy . " " done ! taken ! " and so the bet was made .
