the robber agreed with delight , feeling certain of victory , for he was famous as a fencer in his province and he did not know who his adversary was . he seized quickly what he thought was his sword and stood on guard to defend himself . alas ! for the rebel the sword was the wooden one of the young prince and in vain takeru tried to unsheathe it - it was jammed fast , not all his exerted strength could move it . even if his efforts had been successful the sword would have been of no use to him for it was of wood . yamato take saw that his enemy was in his power , and swinging high the sword he had taken from takeru he brought it down with great might and dexterity and cut off the robber 's head .
