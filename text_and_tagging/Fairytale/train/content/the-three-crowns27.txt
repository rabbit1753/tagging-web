so the king said they should put off the marriage . ' for , ' says he , ' i see there is no use in thinking of it till the youngest gets her three crowns , and is married with the others . i 'll give my youngest daughter for a wife to whoever brings three crowns to me like the others ; and if he does n't care to be married , some other one will , and i 'll make his fortune . ' ' i wish , ' says the smith , ' i could do it ; but i was looking at the crowns after the princesses got home , and i do n't think there 's a black or a white smith on the face of the earth that could imitate them . ' ' faint heart never won fair lady , ' says the prince . ' go to the palace and ask for a quarter of a pound of gold , a quarter of a pound of silver , and a quarter of a pound of copper . get one crown for a pattern , and my head for a pledge , i 'll give you out the very things that are wanted in the morning . ' ' are you in earnest ? ' says the smith . ' faith , i am so , ' says he . ' go ! you ca n't do worse than lose . '
