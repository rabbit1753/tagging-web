on the following sunday there was communion . karen looked first at the black shoes , then at the red ones -- looked at the red ones again , and put them on . the sun was shining gloriously , so karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn , where it was rather dusty . at the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch ; he had a wonderfully long beard , more red than white , and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes . then karen put out her little foot too . " dear me , what pretty dancing - shoes ! " said the soldier . " sit fast , when you dance , " said he , addressing the shoes , and slapping the soles with his hand . the old lady gave the soldier some money and then went with karen into the church . and all the people inside looked at karen 's red shoes , and all the figures gazed at them ; when karen knelt before the altar and put the golden goblet to her mouth , she thought only of the red shoes . it seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the goblet , and she forgot to sing the psalm , forgot to say the " lord 's prayer .
