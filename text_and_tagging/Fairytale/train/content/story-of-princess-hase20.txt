there was only one person who was not pleased at hase - hime 's success . that one was her stepmother . forever brooding over the death of her own child whom she had killed when trying to poison her step - daughter , she had the mortification of seeing her rise to power and honor , marked by imperial favor and the admiration of the whole court . her envy and jealousy burned in her heart like fire . many were the lies she carried to her husband about hase - hime , but all to no purpose . he would listen to none of her tales , telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken . at last the step - mother , seizing the opportunity of her husband 's absence , ordered one of her old servants to take the innocent girl to the hibari mountains , the wildest part of the country , and to kill her there . she invented a dreadful story about the little princess , saying that this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family - by killing her .
