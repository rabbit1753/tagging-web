" o illustrious prince , though it is not right for a guest to even seem to observe aught that may be awry , or not as it should be , in the hall of his entertainer , yet the sorrow of a kindly host is a sorrow , too , to his guest , and sometimes unawares the man of the house finds succour and help in the stranger . there is sorrow in this chamber of festivity . if anyone who is dear to thee and thy people happens to be dead , i can do nothing . but i say it , and it is not a vain boast , that even if a person is at the point of death , i can restore him to life and health , for there are marvellous powers of life - giving in my two hands . " conn the hundred - fighter answered , " our grief is not such as you suppose ; and why should i not tell a cause of shame , which is known far and wide ? this , then , is the reason of our being together , and the gloom which is over us . there is a mighty enchanter whose dwelling is in the haunted mountains of slieve gullion in the north . his name is allen , son of midna , and his enmity to me is as great as his power . once every year , at this season , it is his pleasure to burn tara . descending out of his wizard haunts , he standeth over against the city and shoots balls of fire out of his mouth against it , till it is consumed . then he goes away mocking and triumphant . this annual building of tara , only to be annually consumed , is a shame to me , and till this enchanter declared war against me , i have lived without reproach .
