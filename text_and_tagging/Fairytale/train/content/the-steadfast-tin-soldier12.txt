' that 's the wife for me ! ' he thought ; ' but she is so grand , and lives in a castle , whilst i have only a box with four - and - twenty others . this is no place for her ! but i must make her acquaintance . ' then he stretched himself out behind a snuff - box that lay on the table ; from thence he could watch the dainty little lady , who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance . when the night came all the other tin - soldiers went into their box , and the people of the house went to bed . then the toys began to play at visiting , dancing , and fighting . the tin - soldiers rattled in their box , for they wanted to be out too , but they could not raise the lid . the nut - crackers played at leap - frog , and the slate - pencil ran about the slate ; there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk to them , in poetry too ! the only two who did not stir from their places were the tin - soldier and the little dancer . she remained on tip - toe , with both arms outstretched ; he stood steadfastly on his one leg , never moving his eyes from her face .
