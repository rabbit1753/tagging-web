" yes , yes , " said the gooseherd , " it is as plain as reading and writing and the nose on your face that you are just fit for nothing at all ! all the same , we 'll make one more try to mend the crack in your luck . the king up in the castle yonder is married and is going to give a grand feast . they are wanting a body in the kitchen to draw the water and chop the wood ; and you shall go and try your hand at that ; and see , here is a basket ; you shall take it along and bring home the kitchen scrapings for supper . " so off went the princess to the castle kitchen , and there she drew the water and chopped the wood for the cook . after her work was done she begged so prettily for the kitchen scrapings that the cook filled her basket full of the leavings from the pots and the pans , for they were about having a grand dinner up - stairs and the king was going to bring home his wife that day .
