when notscha was seven years old he once ran away from home . he came to the river of nine bends , whose green waters flowed along between two rows of weeping - willows . the day was hot , and notscha entered the water to cool himself . he unbound his crimson silk cloth and whisked it about in the water to wash it . but while notscha sat there and whisked about his scarf in the water , it shook the castle of the dragon - king of the eastern sea to its very foundations . so the dragon - king sent out a triton , terrible to look upon , who was to find out what was the matter . when the triton saw the boy he began to scold . but the latter merely looked up and said : " what a strange - looking beast you are , and you can actually talk ! " then the triton grew enraged , leaped up and struck at notscha with his ax . but the latter avoided the blow , and threw his golden armlet at him . the armlet struck the triton on the head and he sank down dead .
