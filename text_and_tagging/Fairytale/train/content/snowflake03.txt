they had finished the nose and the chin . two holes were left for the eyes , and ivan carefully shaped out the mouth . no sooner had he done so than he felt a warm breath upon his cheek . he started back in surprise and looked - and behold ! the eyes of the child met his , and its lips , which were as red as raspberries , smiled at him ! ' what is it ? ' cried ivan , crossing himself . ' am i mad , or is the thing bewitched ? ' the snow - child bent its head as if it had been really alive . it moved its little arms and its little legs in the snow that lay about it just as the living children did theirs . ' ah ! ivan , ivan , ' exclaimed marie , trembling with joy , ' heaven has sent us a child at last ! ' and she threw herself upon snowflake ( for that was the snow - child 's name ) and covered her with kisses . and the loose snow fell away from snowflake as an egg shell does from an egg , and it was a little girl whom marie held in her arms . ' oh ! my darling snowflake ! ' cried the old woman , and led her into the cottage .
