when the lamia was gone away , letiko called out : ' little hares ! little hares ! ' then said one hare to the other : ' listen , letiko is calling ; ' and they both ran back to her as fast as they could go . then letiko came down from the tree , and they went on their way . the lamia ran as fast as she could after them , to catch them up , and when she came to a field where people were working she asked them : ' have you seen anyone pass this way ? ' they answered : ' we are planting beans . ' ' oh ! i did not ask about that ; but if anyone had passed this way . ' but the people only answered the louder : ' are you deaf ? it is beans , beans , beans we are planting . '
