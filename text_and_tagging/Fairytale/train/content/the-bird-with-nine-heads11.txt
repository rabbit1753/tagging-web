" no , " said the youth . " i will wait below here , until you are in safety . " at first the king 's daughter was not willing ; yet at last she allowed herself to be persuaded , and climbed into the basket . but before she did so , she took a long pin from her hair , broke it into two halves and gave him one and kept the other . she also divided her silken kerchief with him , and told him to take good care of both her gifts . but when the other man had drawn up the king 's daughter , he took her along with him , and left the youth in the cave , in spite of all his calling and pleading . and this was on the very day that the litter arrived . the king 's daughter saw the half of her silken handkerchief in the youth 's hand , and filled with joy , she led him to her father . there he had to show his half of the long pin , which fitted the other exactly , and then the king was convinced that he was the right , true deliverer . the false bridegroom was now punished , the wedding celebrated , and they lived in peace and happiness till the end of their days .
