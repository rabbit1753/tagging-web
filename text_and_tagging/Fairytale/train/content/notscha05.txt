li dsing was much frightened , and thought it was an apparition . he clove the circling ball with his sword , and out of it leaped a small boy whose whole body glowed with a crimson radiance . but his face was delicately shaped and white as snow . about his right arm he wore a golden armlet and around his thighs was wound a length of crimson silk , whose glittering shine dazzled the eyes . when li dsing saw the child he took pity on him and did not slay him , while his wife began to love the boy dearly . when three days had passed , all his friends came to wish him joy . they were just sitting at the festival meal when a taoist priest entered and said : " i am the great one . this boy is the bright pearl of the beginning of things , bestowed upon you as your son . yet the boy is wild and unruly , and will kill many men . therefore i will take him as my pupil to gentle his savage ways . " li dsing bowed his thanks and the great one disappeared .
