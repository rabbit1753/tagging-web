" god greet you , father , " she said , " i had a most strange and lovely dream last night . " " and what did you dream , my girl ? " said the king . " o , i dreamt that i was in the new castle over yonder , and there was a duke , handsome and so splendid beyond anything i could have imagined , and now i want a husband . " " what , you want a husband , and you have never even deigned to look at a man ; that is very strange ! " said the king . " be that as it may , " said the princess , " but that is how i feel now ; and i want a husband , and the duke is the husband i want , " she concluded .
