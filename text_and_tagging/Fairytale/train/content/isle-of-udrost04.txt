" god be praised , now i am safe , for this is udrost ! " said isaac to himself . directly ahead of him lay a field of barley , with ears so large and heavy that he had never seen their like . through the barley - field a narrow path led to a green turf - roofed cottage of clay , that rose above the field . on the roof of the cottage grazed a white goat with gilded horns , and an udder as large as that of the largest cow . before the door sat a little man clad in blue , puffing away at a little pipe . he had a beard so long and so large that it hung far down upon his breast .
