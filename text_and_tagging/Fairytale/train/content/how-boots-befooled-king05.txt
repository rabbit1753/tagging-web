but the king was not so silly as to be fooled in that way . " here is a jack , " said he , " who will soon have more stripes on his back than he will like . take him away and give him his whipping ! " then it was done as the king had said , and paul went away home bawling like a calf . one day up spoke boots . " i should like to go and have a try for the pretty princess , too , " said he . at this they all stared and sniggered . what ! he go where his clever brothers had failed , and had nothing to show for the trying but a good beating ? what had come over the lout ! here was a pretty business , to be sure ! that was what they all said . but all of this rolled away from boots like water from a duck 's back . no matter , he would like to go and have a try like the others . so he begged and begged until his father was glad to let him go to be rid of his teasing , if nothing else . then boots asked if he might have the old tattered hat that hung back of the chimney .
