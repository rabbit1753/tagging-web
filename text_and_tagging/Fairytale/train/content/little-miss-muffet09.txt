" she must have climbed into the cart when i left the town , " he said ; " but waken her , wife , and we will hear what she has to say . " so the farmer 's wife shook the girl by the arm , and miss muffet sat up in the cart and rubbed her eyes and wondered where she was . " how came you in my cart ? " asked the farmer . " i caught on behind , and climbed in , " answered the girl . " what is your name , and where do you live ? " enquired the farmer 's wife . " my name is miss muffet , and i live in a big city,-but where , i do not know . " and that was all she could tell them , so the woman said at last , " we must keep her till some one comes to claim her , and she can earn her living by helping me make the cheeses . " " that will be nice , " said miss muffet , with a laugh , " for nurse holloweg never lets me do anything , and i should like to help somebody do something . "
