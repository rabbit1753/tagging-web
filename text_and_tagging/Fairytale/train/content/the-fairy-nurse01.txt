there was once a little farmer and his wife living near coolgarrow . they had three children , and my story happened while the youngest was a baby . the wife was a good wife enough , but her mind was all on her family and her farm , and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep , and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it need be . so , friends , she let her man and her two children go before her one day to mass , while she called to consult a fairy man about a disorder one of her cows had . she was late at the chapel , and was sorry all the day after , for her husband was in grief about it , and she was very fond of him . late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling out ' mother ! mother ! ' when he sat up and rubbed his eyes , there was no wife by his side , and when he asked the little ones what was become of their mother , they said they saw the room full of nice little men and women , dressed in white and red and green , and their mother in the middle of them , going out by the door as if she was walking in her sleep . out he ran , and searched everywhere round the house but , neither tale nor tidings did he get of her for many a day .
