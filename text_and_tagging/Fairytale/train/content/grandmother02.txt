" i wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way ? do you know ? " why , when grandmother 's tears fall upon the rose , and she is looking at it , the rose revives , and fills the room with its fragrance ; the walls vanish as in a mist , and all around her is the glorious green wood , where in summer the sunlight streams through thick foliage ; and grandmother , why she is young again , a charming maiden , fresh as a rose , with round , rosy cheeks , fair , bright ringlets , and a figure pretty and graceful ; but the eyes , those mild , saintly eyes , are the same,--they have been left to grandmother . at her side sits a young man , tall and strong ; he gives her a rose and she smiles . grandmother can not smile like that now . yes , she is smiling at the memory of that day , and many thoughts and recollections of the past ; but the handsome young man is gone , and the rose has withered in the old book , and grandmother is sitting there , again an old woman , looking down upon the withered rose in the book .
