" ' the whole world is but a series of miracles , ' said the lecturer , ' but we are so accustomed to them that we call them everyday matters . ' and he went on explaining things to me till my skull seemed lifted from my brain . i declared that were i not such an old fellow , i would at once become a member of the polytechnic institution , that i might learn to look at the bright side of everything , although i was one of the happiest of men . " ' one of the happiest ! ' said the lecturer , as if the idea pleased him . ' are you really happy ? ' " ' yes , ' i replied ; ' for i am welcomed in every town , when i arrive with my company . but i certainly have one wish which sometimes weighs upon my cheerful temper like a mountain of lead . i should like to become the manager of a real theatre , and the director of a real troupe of men and women . ' " ' i understand , ' he said ; ' you would like to have life breathed into your puppets , so that they might be living actors , and you their director . and would you then be quite happy ? '
