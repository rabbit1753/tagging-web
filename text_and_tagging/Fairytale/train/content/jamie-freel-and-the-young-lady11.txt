down in fannet , in times gone by , lived jamie freel and his mother . jamie was the widow 's sole support . his strong arm worked for her untiringly , and as each saturday night came round he poured his wages into her lap , thanking her dutifully for the halfpence which she returned him for tobacco . he was extolled by his neighbours as the best son ever known or heard of . but he had neighbours of whose opinions he was ignorant . neighbours who lived pretty close to him , whom he had never seen , who are , indeed , rarely seen by mortals , except on may eves or halloweens . an old ruined castle , about a quarter of a mile from his cabin , was said to be the abode of the " wee folk . " every halloween were the ancient windows lighted up , and passersby saw little figures flitting to and fro inside the building , while they heard the music of flutes and pipes . it was well known that fairy revels took place . nobody had the courage to intrude on them . jamie had often watched the little figures from a distance , and listened to the charming music , wondering what the inside of the castle was like . one halloween he got up , and took his cap , saying to his mother , " i 'm awa to the castle to seek my fortune . " " what ! " cried she . " would you venture there -- you that 's the widow 's only son ? dinna be so venturesome and foolitch , jamie ! they 'll kill you , and then what 'll come on me ? " " never fear , mother ; no harm'll happen me , but i maun gae . "
