" my son , " said he , " some of these manitoes that i have asked to come here are of a very wicked temper , and i warn you especially of that island spirit who wished to marry my daughter . he is a very bad - hearted monedo , and would like to do you harm . some of the company you will , however , find to be very friendly . a caution for you . when they come in , do you sit close by your wife ; if you do not , you will be lost . she only can save you ; for those who are expected to come are so powerful that they will otherwise draw you from your seat , and toss you out of the lodge as though you were a feather . you have only to observe my words and all will be well . " wassamo took heed to what the old spirit said , and answered that he would obey .
