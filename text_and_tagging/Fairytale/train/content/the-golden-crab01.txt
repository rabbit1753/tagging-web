once upon a time there was a fisherman who had a wife and three children . every morning he used to go out fishing , and whatever fish he caught he sold to the king . one day , among the other fishes , he caught a golden crab . when he came home he put all the fishes together into a great dish , but he kept the crab separate because it shone so beautifully , and placed it upon a high shelf in the cupboard . now while the old woman , his wife , was cleaning the fish , and had tucked up her gown so that her feet were visible , she suddenly heard a voice , which said : ' let down , let down thy petticoat that lets thy feet be seen . '
