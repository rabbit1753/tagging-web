and she fetched leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the fawn , and every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself , and fresh grass for the fawn , who ate out of her hand with joy , frolicking round her . at night , when the sister was tired , and had said her prayers , she laid her head on the fawn 's back , which served her for a pillow , and softly fell asleep . and if only the brother could have got back his own shape again , it would have been a charming life . so they lived a long while in the wilderness alone . now it happened that the king of that country held a great hunt in the forest . the blowing of the horns , the barking of the dogs , and the lusty shouts of the huntsmen sounded through the wood , and the fawn heard them and was eager to be among them . " oh , " said he to his sister , " do let me go to the hunt ; i can not stay behind any longer , " and begged so long that at last she consented .
