' now it is winter out - doors , ' thought the fir - tree . ' the ground is hard and covered with snow , they ca n't plant me yet , and that is why i am staying here under cover till the spring comes . how thoughtful they are ! only i wish it were not so terribly dark and lonely here ; not even a little hare ! it was so nice out in the wood , when the snow lay all around , and the hare leapt past me ; yes , even when he leapt over me : but i did n't like it then . it 's so dreadfully lonely up here . ' ' squeak , squeak ! ' said a little mouse , stealing out , followed by a second . they sniffed at the fir - tree , and then crept between its boughs . ' it 's frightfully cold , ' said the little mice .
