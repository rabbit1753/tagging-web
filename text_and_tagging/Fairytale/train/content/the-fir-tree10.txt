' am i too destined to the same brilliant career ? ' wondered the fir - tree excitedly . ' that is even better than sailing over the sea ! i am sick with longing . if it were only christmas ! now i am tall and grown - up like those which were taken away last year . ah , if i were only in the cart ! if i were only in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence ! and then ? then comes something better , something still more beautiful , else why should they dress us up ? there must be something greater , something grander to come - but what ? oh ! i am pining away ! i really do n't know what 's the matter with me ! ' ' rejoice in us , ' said the air and sunshine , ' rejoice in your fresh youth in the free air ! '
