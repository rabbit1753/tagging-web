in the evening he returned , with his customary good luck , bringing in a fine deer . he again found that a lodge had taken the place of his bundle . he gazed through an opening in the side of the lodge , and there was another beautiful woman sitting alone , with a bundle by her side . as soon as he entered the lodge , she rose cheerfully , welcomed him home , and without delay or complaining , she brought in the deer , cut it up as it should be , and hung up the meat to dry . she then prepared a portion of it for the supper of the weary hunter . the man thought to himself , " now i am certainly blessed . " he continued his practice of hunting every day , and the woman , on his return , always welcomed him , readily took charge of the meat , and promptly prepared his evening meal ; and he ever after lived a contented and happy man .
