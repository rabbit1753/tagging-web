whereupon she handed celandine a small piece of black bread and uncovered the dish , which contained two dried plums . ' we will have one between us , ' continued the old dame ; ' and as you are the visitor , you shall have the half which contains the stone ; but be very careful that you do n't swallow it , for i keep them against the winter , and you have no idea what a good fire they make . now , you take my advice -- which wo n't cost you anything -- and remember that it is always more economical to buy fruit with stones on this account . ' celandine , absorbed in her own sad thoughts , did not even hear this prudent counsel , and quite forgot to eat her share of the plum , which delighted the old woman , who put it by carefully for her breakfast , saying : ' i am very much pleased with you , and if you go on as you have begun , we shall do very well , and i can teach you many useful things which people do n't generally know . for instance , look at my house ! it is built entirely of the seeds of all the pears i have eaten in my life . now , most people throw them away , and that only shows what a number of things are wasted for want of a little patience and ingenuity . ' but celandine did not find it possible to be interested in this and similar pieces of advice . and the old woman soon sent her to bed , for fear the night air might give her an appetite . she passed a sleepless night ; but in the morning the old dame remarked : ' i heard how well you slept . after such a night you can not want any breakfast ; so while i do my household tasks you had better stay in bed , since the more one sleeps the less one need eat ; and as it is market - day i will go to town and buy a pennyworth of bread for the week 's eating .
