when jack had got his bagpipes he said , ' daddy , do go to the smithy and have the house cock shod for me ; then i 'll ride off and trouble you no more . ' his father , who was delighted at the prospect of getting rid of him , had the cock shod , and when it was ready jack my hedgehog mounted on its back and rode off to the forest , followed by all the pigs and asses which he had promised to look after . having reached the forest he made the cock fly up to the top of a very tall tree with him , and there he sat looking after his pigs and donkeys , and he sat on and on for several years till he had quite a big herd ; but all this time his father knew nothing about him . jack my hedgehog continued to herd his pigs , and they increased in number till there were so many that the forest seemed full of them . so he made up his mind to live there no longer , and sent a message to his father telling him to have all the stables and outhouses in the village cleared , as he was going to bring such an enormous herd that all who would might kill what they chose . his father was much vexed at this news , for he thought jack had died long ago . jack my hedgehog mounted his cock , and driving his pigs before him into the village , he let every one kill as many as they chose , and such a hacking and hewing of pork went on as you might have heard for miles off . then said jack , ' daddy , let the blacksmith shoe my cock once more ; then i 'll ride off , and i promise you i 'll never come back again as long as i live . ' so the father had the cock shod , and rejoiced at the idea of getting rid of his son .
