she went to the parsonage , and begged that she might be taken into service there . she would be industrious , she said , and do everything that she could ; she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her , and was with good people . the pastor 's wife had pity on her , and took her into service . and she was industrious and thoughtful . she sat quiet and listened when the pastor read aloud from the bible in the evening . all the children liked her very much , but when they spoke about dress and grandeur and beauty she would shake her head .
