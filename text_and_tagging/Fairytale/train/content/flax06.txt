years passed away , and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together . " it must end very soon , " said the pieces to each other . " we would gladly have held together a little longer , but it is useless to expect impossibilities . " and at length they fell into rags and tatters and thought it was all over with them , for they were torn to shreds and steeped in water and made into a pulp and dried , and they knew not what besides , till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper . " well , now , this is a surprise -- a glorious surprise too , " said the paper . " now i am finer than ever , and who can tell what fine things i may have written upon me ? this is wonderful luck ! " and so it was , for the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it , and only once was there a blot , which was remarkable good fortune . then people heard the stories and poetry read , and it made them wiser and better ; for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning , and a great blessing was contained in it .
