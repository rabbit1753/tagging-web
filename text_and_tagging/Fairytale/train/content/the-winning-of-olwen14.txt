' ' the man to whom this ring belonged you shall see here in the evening , ' answered the shepherd ; ' he is kilweh , son of kilydd , cousin to king arthur , and he has come to seek olwen . ' and when the wife heard that she knew that kilweh was her nephew , and her heart yearned after him , half with joy at the thought of seeing him , and half with sorrow for the doom she feared . soon they heard steps approaching , and kai and the rest entered into the house and ate and drank . after that the woman opened a chest , and out of it came a youth with curling yellow hair .
