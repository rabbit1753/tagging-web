next day , he went out after breakfast , and she sent the prince to the castle where the eldest sister was . the same thing happened there ; but when the giant was snoring , the princess wakened up the prince , and they saddled two steeds in the stables and rode into the field on them . but the horses ' heels struck the stones outside the gate , and up got the giant and strode after them . he roared and he shouted , and the more he shouted , the faster ran the horses , and just as the day was breaking he was only twenty perches behind . but the prince did n't leave the castle of seven inches without being provided with something good . he reined in his steed , and flung a short , sharp knife over his shoulder , and up sprung a thick wood between the giant and themselves . they caught the wind that blew before them , and the wind that blew behind them did not catch them . at last they were near the castle where the other sister lived ; and there she was , waiting for them under a high hedge , and a fine steed under her .
