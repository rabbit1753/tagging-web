" how now ! are you dumb ? " cried the old witch ; " i will see whether i can not bring speech to your lips . " she raised her hand - slap!-she struck , and so hard was the blow that her hand stuck fast to the honey and barley - meal . " what ! " cried she , " will you hold me?"-slap!-she struck with the other hand , and it too stuck fast . so there she was , and , for all that i know , she is sticking to the woman of honey and barley - meal to this day . as for the swan maiden and the prince , they flew over the seven high mountains , the seven deep valleys , and the seven wide rivers , until they came near to the prince 's home again . the swan maiden lit in a great wide field , and there she told the prince to break open one of the crow 's eggs . the prince did as she bade him , and what should he find but the most beautiful little palace , all of pure gold and silver . he set the palace on the ground , and it grew and grew and grew until it covered as much ground as seven large barns .
