chippy hackee was not too fat , but he did not want to come ; he stayed down below and chuckled . and so it went on for a fortnight ; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree , and opened up the hole and let in the rain . then timmy tiptoes came out , and went home with an umbrella . but chippy hackee continued to camp out for another week , although it was uncomfortable . at last a large bear came walking through the wood . perhaps he also was looking for nuts ; he seemed to be sniffing around . chippy hackee went home in a hurry ! and when chippy hackee got home , he found he had caught a cold in his head ; and he was more uncomfortable still . and now timmy and goody tiptoes keep their nut - store fastened up with a little padlock . and whenever that little bird sees the chipmunks , he sings--"who's - been - digging - up my - nuts ? who 's been digging - up my - nuts ? " but nobody ever answers !
