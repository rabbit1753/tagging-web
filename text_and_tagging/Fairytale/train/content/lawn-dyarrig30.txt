ur and arthur went at the basket and lawn dyarrig at twisting the gads . when lawn dyarrig came to the opening with the gads all twisted and made into one , they had n't the ribs of the basket in the ground yet . " oh , then , have n't ye anything done but that ? " " stop your mouth , " said ur , " or we 'll make a mortar of your head on the next stone . " " to be kind to one another is the best for us , " said lawn dyarrig . " i 'll make the basket . " while they 'd be putting one rod in the basket he had the basket finished . " oh , brother , " said they , " you are a quick workman . " they had not called him brother since they left home till that moment . " who will go in the basket now ? " said lawn dyarrig when it was finished and the gad tied to it . " who but me ? " said ur . " i am sure , brothers , if i see anything to frighten me you 'll draw me up . " " we will , " said the other two . he went in , but had not gone far when he cried to pull him up again . " by my father , and the tooth of my father , and by all that is in erin , dead or alive , i would not give one other sight on terrible valley ! " he cried , when he stepped out of the basket .
