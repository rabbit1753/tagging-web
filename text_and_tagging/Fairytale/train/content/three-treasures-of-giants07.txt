scarcely had they done this when jack threw open another door , and this time it led to a hall filled with silver . in an instant his brothers had turned their bags upside down , so that the copper money tumbled out on to the floor , and were shovelling in handfuls of the silver instead . they had hardly finished , when jack opened yet a third door , and all three fell back in amazement , for this room as a mass of gold , so bright that their eyes grew sore as they looked at it . however , they soon recovered from their surprise , and quickly emptied their bags of silver , and filled them with gold instead . when they would hold no more , martin said : ' we had better hurry off now lest somebody else should come , and we might not know what to do ' ; and , followed by michael , he hastily left the castle . jack lingered behind for a few minutes to put pieces of gold , silver , and copper into his pocket , and to eat the food that his brothers had thrown down in the first room . then he went after them , and found them lying down to rest in the midst of a forest . it was near sunset , and martin began to feel hungry , so , when jack arrived , he bade him return to the castle and bring the bread and cheese that they had left there .
