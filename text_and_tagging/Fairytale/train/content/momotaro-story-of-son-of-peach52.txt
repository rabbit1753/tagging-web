the pheasant , who was all this time fighting hard , saw momotaro and his little band rush in at the back . momotaro 's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him . at first their foe had been a single bird , the pheasant , but now that momotaro and the dog and the monkey had arrived they were bewildered , for the four enemies fought like a hundred , so strong were they . some of the devils fell off the parapet of the castle and were dashed to pieces on the rocks beneath ; others fell into the sea and were drowned ; many were beaten to death by the three animals .
