" i am able to affirm with word of oath , that each prize -- at least , those for which i voted -- was given with just and proper consideration , " said the old boundary post in the wood , who was a member of the committee of judges . " i always act with due order , consideration , and calculation . seven times have i already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes , and to vote ; but to - day is the first time i have been able to carry out my will . i always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning , and the second by going through from the end . be so kind as to give me your attention , and i will explain to you how i reckon from the beginning . the eighth letter from a is h , and there we have h for hare ; therefore i awarded to the hare the first prize . the eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is s , and therefore the snail received the second prize . next year , the letter i will have its turn for the first prize , and the letter r for the second .
