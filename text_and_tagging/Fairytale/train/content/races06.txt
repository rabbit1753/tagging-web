" buz , " said the fly ; " there , i 'm not going to make a long speech ; but i wish to say something about hares . i have really overtaken more than one hare , when i have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train . i often do so . one can then so easily judge of one 's own swiftness . not long ago , i crushed the hind legs of a young hare . he had been running a long time before the engine ; he had no idea that i was travelling there . at last he had to stop in his career , and the engine ran over his hind legs , and crushed them ; for i set upon it . i left him lying there , and rode on farther . i call that conquering him ; but i do not want the prize .
