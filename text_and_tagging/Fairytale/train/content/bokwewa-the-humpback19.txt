he shed tears of pity to see that his brother had laid aside the arms of a hunter , and that he was beating corn with the women , indifferent to the fate and the fortune of his lost wife . bokwewa ascertained that his brother 's wife had passed on to a country beyond . after deliberating for a time , and spending several days in a severe fast , he set out in the direction where he saw that a light shone from the sky . it was far off , but bokwewa had a stout heart ; and strong in the faith that he was now on the broad path toward the happy land , he pressed forward . for many days he traveled without encountering any thing unusual . and now plains of vast extent , and rich in waving grass , began to pass before his eyes . he saw many beautiful groves , and heard the songs of countless birds . at length he began to fail in strength for lack of food ; when he suddenly reached a high ground . from this he caught the first glimpse of the other land . but it appeared to be still far off , and all the country between , partly vailed in silvery mists , glittered with lakes and streams of water . as he pressed on , bokwewa came in sight of innumerable herds of stately deer , moose , and other animals which walked near his path , and they appeared to have no fear of man .
