" yes , there is one thing that you could do , " she answered harshly . " i know full well that , even although it is the only thing that will cure me , you will not do it . " " no , " said the king , " i deserve better words from your mouth than these . you know that i would give tyou anything that you care to ask , even if it be the half of my kingdom . " " then give me thy daughter 's heart to eat , " cried the queen . " unless i can obtain that , i will die , and that speedily . " she spoke so wildly , and looked at him in such a strange fashion , that the poor king really thought that her brain was turned . he was at his wits ' end what to do . he left the room , and paced up and down the corridor in great distress . at last he remembered that that very morning the son of a great king had arrived from a country far over the sea . he asked for his daughter 's hand in marriage . " here is a way out of the difficulty , " he said to himself . " this marriage pleases me well . i will have it celebrated at once . then , when my daughter is safe out of the country , i will send a lad up the hillside . he shall kill a he - goat . i will have its heart prepared and dressed , and send it up to my wife . perhaps the sight of it will cure her of this madness . " so he had the strange prince summoned before him , and told him how the queen had taken a sudden illness that had wrought on her brain . this had caused her to take a dislike to the princess . it seemed as if it would be a good thing if , with the maiden 's consent , the marriage could take place at once , so that the queen might be left alone to recover from her strange malady .
