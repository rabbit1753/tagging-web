while they were talking together , the giant came riding along on his colt shod with gold . when he saw the gate standing open he grew furiously angry and shouted till the whole mountain shook : " who has broken my mountain door ? " the youth boldly answered : " i did , and now i shall break you as well ! ' take hold ! ' seize him ! ' tear ! ' and ' hark ! ' tear him into a thousand pieces . " no sooner had he spoken than the dogs rushed up , fell upon the giant and tore him into countless pieces . then the princess was happy beyond measure and said : " god be praised , now i am freed ! " and she fell upon the youth 's neck and gave him a kiss . but he did not wish to stay there any longer , saddled the giant 's colt , loaded it with all the gold and gear he found in the mountain , and hastily went away with the king 's beautiful daughter .
