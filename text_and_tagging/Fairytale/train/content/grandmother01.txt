grandmother is very old , her face is wrinkled , and her hair is quite white ; but her eyes are like two stars , and they have a mild , gentle expression in them when they look at you , which does you good . she wears a dress of heavy , rich silk , with large flowers worked on it ; and it rustles when she moves . and then she can tell the most wonderful stories . grandmother knows a great deal , for she was alive before father and mother -- that 's quite certain . she has a hymn - book with large silver clasps , in which she often reads ; and in the book , between the leaves , lies a rose , quite flat and dry ; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass , and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly , and tears even come into her eyes .
