" oh let me in ! let me in ! i am cold , and i 'm so wet ! " exclaimed suddenly a child that stood crying at the door and knocking for admittance , while the rain poured down , and the wind made all the windows rattle . " poor thing ! " said the old poet , as he went to open the door . there stood a little boy , quite naked , and the water ran down from his long golden hair . he trembled with cold , and had he not come into a warm room he would most certainly have perished in the frightful tempest . and all good children to whom he related this story , took great heed of this naughty cupid ; but he made fools of them still , for he is astonishingly cunning . when the university students come from the lectures , he runs beside them in a black coat , and with a book under his arm . it is quite impossible for them to know him , and they walk along with him arm in arm , as if he , too , were a student like themselves . then , unperceived , he thrusts an arrow to their bosom . when the young maidens come from being examined by the clergyman , or go to church to be confirmed , there he is again close behind them . yes , he is forever following people . at the play , he sits in the great chandelier and burns in bright flames , so that people think it is really a flame , but they soon discover it is something else . he roves about in the garden of the palace and upon the ramparts : yes , once he even shot your father and mother right in the heart . ask them only and you will hear what they 'll tell you . oh , he is a naughty boy , that cupid ; you must never have anything to do with him . he is forever running after everybody . only think , he shot an arrow once at your old grandmother ! but that is a long time ago , and it is all past now ; however , a thing of that sort she never forgets . fie , naughty cupid ! but now you know him , and you know , too , how ill - behaved he is !
