" " i wish i had some wool , " said the boy , " for i need a new coat very badly , and mamma is so poor she can not buy me one . " " that is too bad , " replied the black sheep ; " but i shall have more wool by and by , and then i will give you a bagful to make a new coat from . " " will you really ? " asked the boy , looking very much pleased .
