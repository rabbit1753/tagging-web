there was once an old widow woman . who lived in a little cottage with her only daughter , who was such a bonnie lassie that everyone liked to look at her . one day the old woman took a notion into her head to bake a girdleful of cakes . so she took down her bakeboard , and went to the chest and fetched a basinful of meal . when she went to seek a jug of water to mix the meal with , she found that there was none in the house .
