" i am very glad that you have found it . let us eat it now , for i am hungry , " said the o fii san . he brought out the kitchen knife , and , placing the peach on a board , was about to cut it when , wonderful to tell , the peach split in two of itself and a clear voice said : " wait a bit , old man ! " and out stepped a beautiful little child . the old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that they fell to the ground . the child spoke again : " do n't be afraid . i am no demon or fairy . i will tell you the truth . heaven has had compassion on you . every day and every night you have lamented that you had no child . your cry has been heard and i am sent to be the son of your old age !
