for to him it was the croak of no earthly bird , but the voice of his wife whispering words of magic to him . and when he heard them he jumped for joy , for he knew that they were words of deliverance , and he shouted them aloud , and his chains fell off , and he mounted in the air -- up and up -- while the onlookers watched him in awestruck silence . he flew right away to the kingdom of fife , without as much as saying good - bye to them ; and when he found himself once more safely at home , you may be very sure that he never tried to find out his wife 's secrets again , but left her alone to her own devices .
