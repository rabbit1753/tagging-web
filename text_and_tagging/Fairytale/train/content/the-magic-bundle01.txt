a poor man , called iena , or the wanderer , was in the habit of roaming about from place to place , forlorn , without relations , and almost helpless . he had often wished for a companion to share his solitude ; but who would think of joining their fortunes with those of a poor wanderer , who had no shelter but such as his leather hunting - shirt provided , and no other household in the world than the bundle which he carried in his hand , and in which his hunting - shirt was laid away ? one day as he went on a hunting excursion , to relieve himself of the burden of carrying it , iena hung up his bundle on the branch of a tree , and then set out in quest of game . on returning to the spot in the evening , he was surprised to find a small but neat lodge built in the place where he had left his bundle ; and on looking in he beheld a beautiful female , sitting on the further side of the lodge , with his bundle lying beside her .
