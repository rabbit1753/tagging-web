it became jamie 's turn to speak , and he gave the history of the fairy journey , of the theft of the young lady , of the figure he had seen laid in its place , of her life with his mother in fannet , of last halloween , and of the three drops that had released her from her enchantments . she took up the story when he paused and told how kind the mother and son had been to her . the parents could not make enough of jamie . they treated him with every distinction , and when he expressed his wish to return to fannet , said they did not know what to do to express their gratitude . but an awkward complication arose . the daughter would not let him go without her . " if jamie goes , i 'll go , too , " she said . " he saved me from the fairies , and has worked for me ever since . if it had not been for him , dear father and mother , you would never have seen me again . if he goes , i 'll go , too . " this being her resolution , the old gentleman said that jamie should become his son - in - law . the mother was brought from fannet in a coach - and - four , and there was a splendid wedding . they all lived together in the grand dublin house , and jamie was heir to untold wealth at his father - in - law 's death .
