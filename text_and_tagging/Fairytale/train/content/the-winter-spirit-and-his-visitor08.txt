at length the sun begun to rise . a gentle warmth came over the place . the tongue of the old man became silent . the robin and the blue - bird began to sing on the top of the lodge . the stream began to murmur by the door , and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal breeze . daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his entertainer . when he looked upon him he had the visage of peboan , the icy old winter - spirit . streams began to flow from his eyes . as the sun increased he grew less and less in stature , and presently he had melted completely away . nothing remained on the place of his lodge - fire but the mis - kodeed , a small white flower with a pink border , which the young visitor , seegwun , the spirit of spring , placed in the wreath upon his brow , as his first trophy in the north .
