the hare humbled himself before this great fairy okuni - nushi - no - mikoto , whom many in that part of the land worshiped as a god . " oh , i did not know that you were okuni - nushi - no - mikoto . how kind you have been to me ! it is impossible to believe that that unkind fellow who sent me to bathe in the sea is one of your brothers . i am quite sure that the princess , whom your brothers have gone to seek , will refuse to be the bride of any of them . she will prefer you for your goodness of heart . i am quite sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so , and she will ask to be your bride .
