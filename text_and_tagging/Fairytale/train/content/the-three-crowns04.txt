when they got to the edge of the lake what did they find but the beautifullest boat you ever saw in your life ; and says the eldest , ' i 'll take a sail in this fine boat ' ; and says the second eldest , ' i 'll take a sail in this fine boat ' ; and says the youngest , ' i wo n't take a sail in that fine boat , for i am afraid it 's an enchanted one . ' but the others persuaded her to go in , and her father was just going in after her , when up sprung on the deck a little man only seven inches high , and ordered him to stand back . well , all the men put their hands to their swords ; and if the same swords were only playthings , they were n't able to draw them , for all strength that was left their arms . seven inches loosened the silver chain that fastened the boat , and pushed away , and after grinning at the four men , says he to them . ' bid your daughters and your brides farewell for awhile . you , ' says he to the youngest , ' need n't fear , you 'll recover your princess all in good time , and you and she will be as happy as the day is long . bad people , if they were rolling stark naked in gold , would not be rich . good - bye . ' away they sailed , and the ladies stretched out their hands , but were n't able to say a word .
