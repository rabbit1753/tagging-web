in the meantime the master girl sat by the seashore , and waited and waited ; but no king 's son came . then she went on , and after she had gone a while , she came to a little hut that lay all by itself in the forest , near the king 's castle . she went in and asked whether she might not stay there . now the little hut belonged to an old woman , and she was an arrant and evil witch ; at first she did not want to take in the master girl at all ; but at last she agreed to do so for love of money . but the whole hut was as dark and dirty as a pig - sty ; therefore the master girl said she would clean up a bit , so that things would look as they did in other , decent people 's houses . the old woman would have none of it , and was very disagreeable and angry ; but the master girl paid no attention to her . she took the chest of gold dust , and threw a handful into the fire , so that a ray of gold shone over the whole hut , and it was gilded outside and in . but when the gold flamed up , the old woman was so terribly frightened that she ran out as though the evil one were after her , and from pure rage she forgot to duck at the threshold , and ran her head against the door - post . and that was the end of her .
