one evening more than eighty years ago a man named william was passing along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating loudly . william thought it must have strayed from the flock , and that he had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner . so he went up to where it was standing , and as it seemed so tired that it could hardly walk , he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way . the sheep was pretty heavy , but the good man was merciful and staggered along as best he could under his load . ' it is not much further , ' he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of walnut trees , when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head , and made him jump . ' where are you ? ' said the voice , and the sheep answered : ' here on the shoulders of a donkey . ' in another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and william was running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him . but as he went , a laugh , which yet was something of a bleat , rang in his ears . though he tried not to hear , the words reached him , ' oh , dear ! what fun i have had , to be sure !
