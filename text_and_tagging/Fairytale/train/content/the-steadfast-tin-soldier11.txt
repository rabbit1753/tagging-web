when it was morning , and the children had got up , the tin - soldier was put in the window ; and whether it was the wind or the little black imp , i do n't know , but all at once the window flew open and out fell the little tin - soldier , head over heels , from the third - storey window ! that was a terrible fall , i can tell you ! he landed on his head with his leg in the air , his gun being wedged between two paving - stones . the nursery - maid and the little boy came down at once to look for him , but , though they were so near him that they almost trod on him , they did not notice him . if the tin - soldier had only called out ' here i am ! ' they must have found him ; but he did not think it fitting for him to cry out , because he had on his uniform .
