wherever redhead went the wolf followed , and kept one eye on him and the other on tom , to see if he would give him leave to eat him . but tom shook his head , and never stopped the tune . redhead never stopped dancing and bawling and the wolf dancing and roaring , one leg up and the other down , and he ready to drop out of his standing from fair tiresomeness . when the princess seen that there was no fear of anyone being kilt she was so divarted by the stew that redhead was in that she gave another great laugh ; and well become tom , out he cried , " king of dublin , i have two quarters of your daughter . " " oh , quarters or alls , " says the king , " put away that divel of a wolf and we 'll see about it . " so gilla put his flute in his pocket , and says he to the baste that was sittin ' on his currabingo ready to faint , " walk off to your mountains , my fine fellow , and live like a respectable baste . if ever i find you come within seven miles of any town---- " he said no more , but spit in his fist , and gave a flourish of his club . it was all the poor divel wanted . he put his tail between his legs and took to his pumps without looking at man nor mortial , and neither sun , moon , nor stars ever saw him in sight of dublin again . at dinner everyone laughed but the foxy fellow . sure enough , he was laying out how he 'd settle poor tom next day . " well , to be sure ! " says he , " king of dublin , you are in luck . there 's the danes moidhering us to no end . d---- run to lusk wid 'em ! and if anyone can save us from 'em it is this gentleman with the goat - skin . there is a flail hangin ' on the collar - beam in hell , and neither dane nor devil can stand before it . " " so , " says tom to the king , " will you let me have the other half of the princess if i bring you the flail ? " " no , no , " says the princess , " i 'd rather never be your wife than see you in that danger . "
