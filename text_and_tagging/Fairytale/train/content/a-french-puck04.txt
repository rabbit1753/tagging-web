the bridegroom looked , and on one side of the road he saw a large ball of thread of all colours . all the colours , that is , of the dresses that were tied on to the back of the cart . ' well , that is a wonderful piece of good fortune , ' cried he , as he sprang out to get it . ' one would think a fairy had put it there on purpose . ' ' perhaps she has , ' laughed the girl . as she spoke she seemed to hear an echo of her laughter coming from the horse , but of course that was nonsense . the dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her . it matched the stuffs so perfectly , and never tied itself in knots , or broke perpetually , as most thread did . she finished her work much quicker than she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come to the church and see her in her wedding dress . there was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony . the young people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood , and their parents were very rich . the doors were open , and the bride could be seen from afar , walking under the chestnut avenue .
