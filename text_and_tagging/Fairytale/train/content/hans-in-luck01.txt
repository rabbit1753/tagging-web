hans had served his master seven years . at the end of the seventh year he said , " master , my time is up . i want to go home and see my mother , so give me my wages . " " you have served me truly and faithfully , " said the master . " as the service is , so must the wages be , " and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head . hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the lump of gold in it , hoisted it on his shoulder , and set off on his way home . and as he was trudging along , there came in sight a man riding on a spirited horse , and looking very gay and lively . " oh ! " cried hans aloud , " how splendid riding must be ! sitting as much at one 's ease as in an arm - chair , stumbling over no stones , saving one 's shoes , and getting on one hardly knows how ! " the horseman heard hans say this , and called out to him , " well hans , what are you doing on foot ? "
