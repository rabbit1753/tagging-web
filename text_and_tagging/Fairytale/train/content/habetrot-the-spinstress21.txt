she was not alone , for round her were a circle of other little old women , who were seated on large white stones , and they were all spinning away as fast as they could . occasionally one would look up , and then maisie saw that they all seemed to have the same long , thick lips that her friend had . she really felt very sorry , as they all looked exceedingly kind , and might have been pretty had it not been for this defect . one of the spinstresses sat by herself , and was engaged in winding the thread , which the others had spun , into hanks . maisie did not think that this little lady looked so nice as the others . she was dressed entirely in grey , and had a big hooked nose , and great horn spectacles . she seemed to be called slantlie mab , for maisie heard habetrot address her by that name , telling her to make haste and tie up all the thread , for it was getting late , and it was time that the young girl had it to carry home to her mother .
