no sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother - in - law began to show herself in her true colors . she could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl , and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious . she employed her in the meanest work of the house : she scoured the dishes , tables , etc . , and scrubbed madam 's chamber , and those of misses , her daughters ; she lay up in a sorry garret , upon a wretched straw bed , while her sisters lay in fine rooms , with floors all inlaid , upon beds of the very newest fashion , and where they had looking - glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot .
