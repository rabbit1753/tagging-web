a poor man , called iena , or the wanderer , was in the habit of roaming about from place to place , forlorn , without relations , and almost helpless . he had often wished for a companion to share his solitude ; but who would think of joining their fortunes with those of a poor wanderer , who had no shelter but such as his leather hunting - shirt provided , and no other household in the world than the bundle which he carried in his hand , and in which his hunting - shirt was laid away ? one day as he went on a hunting excursion , to relieve himself of the burden of carrying it , iena hung up his bundle on the branch of a tree , and then set out in quest of game . on returning to the spot in the evening , he was surprised to find a small but neat lodge built in the place where he had left his bundle ; and on looking in he beheld a beautiful female , sitting on the further side of the lodge , with his bundle lying beside her . during the day iena had so far prospered in his sport as to kill a deer , which he now cast down at the lodge door . without pausing to take the least notice , or to give a word of welcome to the hunter , the woman ran out and began to see whether it was a large deer that he had brought . in her haste she stumbled and fell at the threshold . iena looked at her with astonishment , and thought to himself , " i supposed i was blessed , but i find my mistake . night - hawk , " said he , speaking aloud , " i will leave my game with you that you may feast on it . " he then took up his bundle and departed . after walking some time he came to another tree , on which he suspended his bundle as before , and went in search of game .
