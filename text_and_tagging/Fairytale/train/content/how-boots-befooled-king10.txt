at this the king hemmed and hawed and scratched his head . yes ; boots had befooled him sure enough , but , after all , he could not give up the princess for such a thing as that . still , he would give boots another chance . now , there was the high - councillor , who was the wisest man in all of the world . did boots think that he could fool him also ? oh , yes ! boots thought that it might be done . very well ; if he could befool the high - councillor so as to bring him to the castle the next morning against his will , boots should have the princess and the half of the kingdom ; if he did not do so he should have his beating . then boots went away , and the king thought that he was rid of him now for good and all . as for the high - councillor , he was not pleased with the matter at all , for he did not like the thought of being fooled by a clever rogue , and taken here and there against his will . so when he had come home , he armed all of his servants with blunderbusses , and then waited to give boots a welcome when he should come .
