" the black thong leapt away , and she bound him , and then the lad took the head off him , and the sea was red with his blood , and the waves of blood were going on the top of the water . the lad came to the land , then , and they tried to keep him ; but he went from them , and as he was riding by the lady snatched the shoe off him .
