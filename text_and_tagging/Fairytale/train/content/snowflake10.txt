the spring passed , and it was the eve of st . john , or midsummer day . this was the greatest holiday of the year , when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play . they went to fetch snowflake , and said to marie : ' let her come and dance with us . ' but marie was afraid ; she could not tell why , only she could not bear the child to go . snowflake did not wish to go either , but they had no excuse ready . so marie kissed the girl and said : ' go , my snowflake , and be happy with your friends , and you , dear children , be careful of her . you know she is the light of my eyes to me .
