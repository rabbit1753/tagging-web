the little prince was very much frightened at the swallow , for in comparison with one so tiny as himself he seemed a giant . but when he saw thumbelina , he was delighted , for she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen . so he took his golden crown from off his head and put it on hers , asking her her name , and if she would be his wife , and then she would be queen of all the flowers . yes ! he was a different kind of husband to the son of the toad and the mole with the black - velvet coat . so she said " yes " to the noble prince . and out of each flower came a lady and gentleman , each so tiny and pretty that it was a pleasure to see them . each brought thumbelina a present , but the best of all was a beautiful pair of wings which were fastened on to her back , and now she too could fly from flower to flower .
