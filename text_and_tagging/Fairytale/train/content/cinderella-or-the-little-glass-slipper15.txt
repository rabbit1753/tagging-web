the king 's son conducted her to the most honorable seat , and afterward took her out to dance with him ; she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her . a fine collation was served up , whereof the young prince ate not a morsel , so intently was he busied in gazing on her . she went and sat down by her sisters , showing them a thousand civilities , giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the prince had presented her with , which very much surprised them , for they did not know her . while cinderella was thus amusing her sisters , she heard the clock strike eleven and three - quarters , whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could . when she got home she ran to seek out her godmother , and , after having thanked her , she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball , because the king 's son had desired her .
