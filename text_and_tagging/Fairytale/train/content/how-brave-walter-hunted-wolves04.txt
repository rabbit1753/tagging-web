it was such a good thing that jonas was going with corn to the mill , for walter got a seat on the load , while caro ran barking beside them . as soon as they came to the wood walter looked cautiously around him to see perchance there was a wolf in the bushe . he did not omit to ask jonas if wolves were afraid of a drum . ' of course they are ' ( that is understood ) said jonas . thereupon walter began to beat his drum with all his might while they were going through the wood . when they came to the mill walter immediately asked if there had been any wolves in the neighbourhood lately .
