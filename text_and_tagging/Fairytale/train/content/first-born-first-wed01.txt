once upon a time there was a king who had a three - year old son , and was obliged to go to war against another king . then , when his ships sailed home again after he had gained a splendid victory , a storm broke out and his whole fleet was near sinking . but the king vowed he would sacrifice to the sea - queen the first male creature that came to meet him when he reached land and entered his capital . thereby the whole fleet reached the harbor in safety . but the five - year old prince , who had not seen his father for the past two years , and who was delighted with the thunder of the cannon as the ships came in , secretly slipped away from his attendants , and ran to the landing . when the king came ashore he was the first to cast himself into his arms , weeping with joy . the king was frightened when he thought of the sea - queen . he thought that , after all , the prince was only a child , and at any rate he could sacrifice the next person to step up to him after the prince .
