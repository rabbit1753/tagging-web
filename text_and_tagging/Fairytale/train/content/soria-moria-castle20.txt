halvor was very restless , and wanted to go right on again , but the woman said there was no need to hurry . " lie down on the bench by the stove , and take a nap , for we have no bed for you , " said she . " i will watch for the west wind 's coming . " all of a sudden the west wind came rushing along so that the walls creaked . the woman ran out : " you west wind ! you west wind ! can you tell me the way to soria - moria castle ? there is a fellow here who wants to know . " " yes , indeed , " said the west wind , " i have to go to that very place , and dry the wash for the wedding soon to be held . if he is quick afoot , he may come along with me . " halvor ran out . " you must hurry if you are going with me , " said the west wind ; and at once he was up and off over hill and dale , land and sea , so that halvor could hardly keep up with him . " now i have no more time to keep you company , " said the west wind , " because i have first to tear down a stretch of pine forest , before i come to the bleaching - field and dry the wash . but if you keep going along the hills , you will meet some girls standing there and washing , and then you will not be far from soria - moria castle .
