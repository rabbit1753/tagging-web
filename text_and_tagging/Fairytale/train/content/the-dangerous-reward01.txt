once upon a time a man named hu - wu - bau , who lived near the great mountain , went walking there one day . and there , under a tree , he met a messenger in a red robe who called out to him : " the lord of the great mountain would like to see you ! " the man was much frightened , but dared offer no objection . the messenger bade him shut his eyes , and when he was allowed to open them again after a short time , he found himself standing before a lofty palace . he entered it to see the god . the latter had a meal prepared for him and said : " i only sent for you to - day because i had heard you intended traveling to the west . and in that case i should like to give you a letter to take to my daughter .
