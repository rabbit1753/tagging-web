" it really seems to me , " thought the wild rose , though she did not express her opinion aloud -- it is not in her nature to do so,--though it would have been quite as well if she had ; " it certainly seems to me that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the first prize . the sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable path from the sun to us . it arrives in such strength , that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty ; we roses blush and exhale fragrance in its presence . our worshipful judges do n't appear to have noticed this at all . were i the sunbeam , i would give each one of them a sun stroke ; but that would only make them mad , and they are mad enough already . i only hope , " continued the rose , " that peace may reign in the wood . it is glorious to bloom , to be fragrant , and to live ; to live in story and in song . the sunbeam will outlive us all .
