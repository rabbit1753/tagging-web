" i could almost wish to be melted down ; but no , that must not be while the old people live . they love me for myself alone ; they keep me bright and supply me with oil . i am as well off as the picture of the congress , in which they take so much pleasure . " and from that time it felt at rest in itself , and not more so than such an honorable old lamp really deserved to be .
