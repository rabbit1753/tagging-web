when this happened , the flopsy bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap , in the ditch outside mr . mcgregor 's garden . mr . mcgregor 's rubbish heap was a mixture . there were jam pots and paper bags , and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine ( which always tasted oily ) , and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two . one day -- oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces , which had " shot " into flower . the flopsy bunnies simply stuffed lettuces . by degrees , one after another , they were overcome with slumber , and lay down in the mown grass . benjamin was not so much overcome as his children . before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies .
