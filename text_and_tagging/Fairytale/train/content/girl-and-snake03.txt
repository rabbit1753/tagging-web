on the third day when she once more went to the wood , everything happened exactly as on the first and second day . the snake invited her to eat and drink , and this time she did so , with a hearty appetite . then the snake told her to lie down beside him and the girl obeyed . then the snake said : " put your arm about me ! " she did so . " and now kiss me , " said the snake , " but if you are afraid , put your apron between us . " the girl did so , and in a moment the snake was turned into a marvellously handsome youth , who was really a prince , bewitched in the form of a snake by magic spells , and now delivered by the girl 's courage . then both of them went away and there was nothing further heard of them .
