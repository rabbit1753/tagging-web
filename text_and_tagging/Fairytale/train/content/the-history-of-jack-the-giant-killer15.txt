the knights and ladies rested that night at the old man 's hermitage , and next day they set out for the court . jack then went up to the king , and gave his majesty an account of all his fierce battles . jack 's fame had now spread through the whole country , and at the king 's desire the duke gave him his daughter in marriage , to the joy of all his kingdom . after this the king gave him a large estate , on which he and his lady lived the rest of their days in joy and contentment.(1 )
