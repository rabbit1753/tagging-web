the following day the youth went to the wood again , with his dog and the two pigs . after a time he sat down and played his flute as usual , and the dog danced to his playing with such skill , that it was nothing short of a miracle . and as he was sitting there , the old man with the gray beard came out of the wood again , and with him another dog , no smaller than the first . when the youth saw the handsome beast he thought to himself : " if a fellow had that dog to keep him company here where it is so lonely , he need have no fear . " when the old man noticed this , he began : " that is why i have come , for i want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs . " the youth did not lose any time , but agreed to close the bargain . he received the great dog , and gave up one of his pigs in place of it . then the old man went his way . yet before he left he added : " you have reason to be well satisfied with your purchase , for this dog is not like the other dogs . his name is ' tear ! ' and if you give him something to tear , he will tear it to pieces , even though it were the grimmest of trolls . " then they parted .
