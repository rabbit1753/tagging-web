" little spirit fired his arrow -- the man fell -- he called out " number two , " and continued his meal . the two others of the four brothers were dispatched in the same quiet way , and counted off as " number three " and " number four . " after they were all well disposed of in this way , the boy - man directed his sister to go out and see them . she presently ran back , saying : " there are four of them .
