now that all three dogs were gone , the giant rose , and suddenly looked altogether different . he took down a long sword from the wall , and said : " now i will do what my brothers did not do , and you must die at once , for you are in my power ! " then the youth was frightened , and he regretted he had allowed his dogs to leave him . he said : " i do not ask for my life , since in any event the time will come when i must die . but i would like to repeat the lord 's prayer , and play a psalm on my flute , for such is the custom in my country . " the giant granted his prayer , but said that he would not wait long . so the youth kneeled and began to blow his flute till it sounded over hill and dale . and that very moment the magic wall was broken and the dogs were freed .
