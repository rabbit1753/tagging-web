now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found . the persimmon - seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone . he , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange . the crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone - like seed , and would not consent to the monkey 's proposition . then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab , saying : " how unwise you are not to think of the future ! your rice - dumpling can be eaten now , and is certainly much bigger than my seed ; but if you sow this seed in the ground it will soon grow and become a great tree in a few years , and bear an abundance of fine ripe persimmons year after year . if only i could show it to you then with the yellow fruit hanging on its branches ! of course , if you do n't believe me i shall sow it myself ; though i am sure , later on , you will be very sorry that you did not take my advice . " the young crab set out at once to call on the mortar , his father 's old friend , and told him of all that had happened . he besought the mortar with tears to help him avenge his father 's death . the mortar was very sorry when he heard the woful tale and promised at once to help the young crab punish the monkey to death . he warned him that he must be very careful in what he did , for the monkey was a strong and cunning enemy . the mortar now sent to fetch the bee and the chestnut ( also the crab 's old friends ) to consult them about the matter . in a short time the bee and the chestnut arrived . when they were told all the details of the old crab 's death and of the monkey 's wickedness and greed , they both gladly consented to help the young crab in his revenge . after talking for a long time as to the ways and means of carrying out their plans they separated , and mr . mortar went home with the young crab to help him bury his poor father .
