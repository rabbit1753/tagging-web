but before he started he gave her a comb , and told her that whenever she used it , pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair . still he had his memory from sunset to sunrise ; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled on under the charm , and never threw his eye behind . this night they came to where the youngest baby was , and the next morning , just before sunrise , the prince spoke to her for the last time . ' here , my poor wife , ' said he , ' is a little hand - reel , with gold thread that has no end , and the half of our marriage ring . if you ever get to my house , and put your half - ring to mine , i shall recollect you . there is a wood yonder , and the moment i enter it i shall forget everything that ever happened between us , just as if i was born yesterday . farewell , dear wife and child , for ever ! ' just then the sun rose , and away he walked towards the wood . she saw it open before him and close after him , and when she came up , she could no more get in than she could break through a stone wall . she wrung her hands and shed tears , but then she recollected herself , and cried out , ' wood , i charge you by my three magic gifts , the scissors , the comb , and the reel -- to let me through ' ; and it opened , and she went along a walk till she came in sight of a palace , and a lawn , and a woodman 's cottage on the edge of the wood where it came nearest the palace .
