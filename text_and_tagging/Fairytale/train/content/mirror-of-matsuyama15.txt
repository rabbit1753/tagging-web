the bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief , and they abandoned themselves to their bitter sorrow . they felt it to be impossible to take leave of the loved woman who till now had filled their whole lives and to commit her body to the earth . but this frantic burst of grief passed , and then they took possession of their own hearts again , crushed though they were in resignation . in spite of this the daughter 's life seemed to her desolate . her love for her dead mother did not grow less with time , and so keen was her remembrance , that everything in daily life , even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind , reminded her of her mother 's death and of all that they had loved and shared together . one day when her father was out , and she was fulfilling her household duties alone , her loneliness and sorrow seemed more than she could bear . she threw herself down in her mother 's room and wept as if her heart would break . poor child , she longed just for one glimpse of the loved face , one sound of the voice calling her pet name , or for one moment 's forgetfulness of the aching void in her heart . suddenly she sat up . her mother 's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief . " oh ! my mother told me when she gave me the mirror as a parting gift , that whenever i looked into it i should be able to meet her - to see her . i had nearly forgotten her last words - how stupid i am . i will get the mirror now and see if it can possibly be true !
