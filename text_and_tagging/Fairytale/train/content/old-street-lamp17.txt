at this moment the wind came rushing round the corner of the street and through the air - holes of the old lamp . " what is this i hear ? " it asked . " are you going away to - morrow ? is this evening the last time we shall meet ? then i must present you with a farewell gift . i will blow into your brain , so that in future not only shall you be able to remember all that you have seen or heard in the past , but your light within shall be so bright that you will be able to understand all that is said or done in your presence . " " oh , that is really a very , very great gift , " said the old lamp . " i thank you most heartily . i only hope i shall not be melted down . " " that is not likely to happen yet , " said the wind . " i will also blow a memory into you , so that , should you receive other similar presents , your old age will pass very pleasantly . " " that is , if i am not melted down , " said the lamp . " but should i , in that case , still retain my memory ? " " do be reasonable , old lamp , " said the wind , puffing away . it seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round . but after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through together -- in rain and in fog , during the short , bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights , through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar . then the lamp felt that all was well again . it saw everything that had happened quite clearly , as if the events were passing before it . surely the wind had given it an excellent gift !
