after a while i found myself lying on my bed in my room ; but how i got there , or how i got away at all from the polytechnic professor , he may perhaps know , i do n't . the moon shone upon the floor , the box lay open , and the dolls were all scattered about in great confusion . but i was not idle . i jumped off the bed , and into the box they all had to go , some on their heads , some on their feet . then i shut down the lid , and seated myself upon the box . ' now you 'll have to stay , ' said i , ' and i shall be cautious how i wish you flesh and blood again . '
