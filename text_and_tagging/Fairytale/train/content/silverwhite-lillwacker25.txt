then the troll humbly begged for his life , and said : " dear lillwacker , i will give you wergild for your brother , only bid your dogs be still , so that we may talk . " at the same time the troll handed him three hairs from his head and added : " lay one of these hairs on each of your dogs , and then they will soon be quiet . " but lillwacker saw through his cunning scheme , took the three hairs and laid them on the troll - dogs , which at once fell on the ground and lay like dead .
