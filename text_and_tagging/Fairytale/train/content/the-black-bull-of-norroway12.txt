the princess was greatly surprised at these words ; but by this time she was too tired to wonder very much at anything , so she did not answer , but sat still where she was , until the bull ran into the courtyard of the castle and knocked his great head against the door . the door was opened at once by a very splendid footman , who treated the black bull with great respect , and helped the princess to alight from his back . then he ushered her into a magnificent hall , where the lord of the castle , and his lady , and a great and noble company were assembled ; while the black bull trotted off quite contentedly to the grassy park which stretched all round the building , to spend the night there . the lord and his lady were very kind to the princess , and gave her her supper , and led her to a richly furnished bedroom , all hung round with golden mirrors , and left her to rest there ; and in the morning , just as the black bull came trotting up to the front door , they handed her a beautiful apple , telling her not to break it , but to put it in her pocket , and keep it till she was in the greatest strait that mortal could be in . then she was to break it , and it would bring her out of it .
