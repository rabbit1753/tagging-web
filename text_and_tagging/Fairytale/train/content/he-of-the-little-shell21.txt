she said , " i would like to go to the place of the breaking of daylight . i have always loved the east . the earliest glimpses of light are from that quarter , and it is to my mind the most beautiful part of the heavens . after i get there , my brother , whenever you see the clouds , in that direction , of various colors , you may think that your sister is painting her face . " " and i , " said he , " i , my sister , shall live on the mountains and rocks . there i can see you at the earliest hour ; there are the streams of water clear ; the air is pure , and the golden lights will shine ever around my head , and i shall ever be called ' puck - ininee , or the little wild man of the mountains . ' but , " he resumed , " before we part forever , i must go and try to find what manitoes rule the earth , and see which of them will be friendly to us . "
