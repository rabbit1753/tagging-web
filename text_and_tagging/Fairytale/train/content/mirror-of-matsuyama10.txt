the wife listened to all her husband told her , and was pleased at learning so much that was new to her . she was still more pleased at the precious gift - his token of remembrance while he had been away . " if the mirror represents my soul , i shall certainly treasure it as a valuable possession , and never will i use it carelessly . " saying so , she lifted it as high as her forehead , in grateful acknowledgment of the gift , and then shut it up in its box and put it away . the wife saw that her husband was very tired , and set about serving the evening meal and making everything as comfortable as she could for him . it seemed to the little family as if they had not known what true happiness was before , so glad were they to be together again , and this evening the father had much to tell of his journey and of all he had seen at the great capital .
