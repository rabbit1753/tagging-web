well , they walked on easy , and the poor hearts beating in both their breasts ; and though he could see nothing , he heard a faint jingle and trampling and rustling , and at last he got the push that she promised . he spread out his arms , and there was his wife 's waist within them , and he could see her plain ; but such a hullabulloo rose as if there was an earthquake , and he found himself surrounded by horrible - looking things , roaring at him and striving to pull his wife away . but he made the sign of the cross and bid them begone in god 's name , and held his wife as if it was iron his arms were made of . bedad , in one moment everything was as silent as the grave , and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms of her husband and her good neighbour . well , all in good time she was minding her family and her business again ; and i 'll go bail , after the fright she got , she spent more time on her knees , and avoided fairy men all the days of the week , and particularly on sunday .
