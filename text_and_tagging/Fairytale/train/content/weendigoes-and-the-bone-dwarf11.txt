the boy from the tree had no more than time to escape , when the hunter entered , and found his son , sitting as usual , near the fire . when he cast his eyes around , he saw that the lodge was in greater confusion than before . " my son , " he said , " you must be very foolish when alone to play so . but , tell me , my son ; i heard two voices , i am sure ; " and he looked closely on the prints of the footsteps in the ashes . " true , " he continued , " here is the print of a foot which is smaller than my son 's ; " and he was now satisfied that his suspicions were well founded , and that some very young person had been the companion of his son . the boy could not now refuse to tell his father what had happened . " father , " he said , " i found a boy in the hollow of that tree , near the lodge , where you placed my mother 's bones . " strange thoughts came over the mind of the hunter ; did his wife live again in this beautiful child ? fearful of disturbing the dead , he did not dare to visit the place where he had deposited her remains . he , however , engaged his son to entice the boy to a dead tree , by the edge of a wood , where they could kill many flying - squirrels by setting it on fire . he said that he would conceal himself near by , and take the boy .
