he set out , and , as he crossed the potato field , came in sight of the castle , whose windows were ablaze with light that seemed to turn the russet leaves , still clinging to the crab - tree branches , into gold . halting in the grove at one side of the ruin , he listened to the elfin revelry . the laughter and singing made him all the more determined to proceed . numbers of little people , the largest about the size of a child of five years old , were dancing to the music of flutes and fiddles , while others drank and feasted . " welcome , jamie freel ! welcome , welcome , jamie ! " cried the company , perceiving their visitor . the word " welcome " was caught up and repeated by every voice in the castle . time flew , and jamie was enjoying himself very much , when his hosts said , " we 're going to ride to dublin to - night to steal a young lady . will you come , too , jamie freel ? " " ay , that i will , " cried the rash youth , thirsting for adventure . a troop of horses stood at the door . jamie mounted , and his steed rose with him into the air . he was presently flying over his mother 's cottage , surrounded by the elfin troop . on and on they went , over bold mountains , over little hills , over the deep lough swilley , over towns and cottages , where people were burning nuts and eating apples and keeping merry halloween . it seemed to jamie that they flew all round ireland before they got to dublin . " this is derry , " said the fairies , flying over the cathedral spire . what was said by one voice was repeated by all the rest , till fifty little voices were crying out , " derry ! derry ! derry ! "
