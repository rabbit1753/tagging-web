" earth was placed in me . for a teapot , this is the same as being buried , but in the earth was placed a flower bulb . who placed it there , who gave it , i know not ; but given it was , and it became a compensation for the chinese leaves and the boiling water , a compensation for the broken handle and spout . " and the bulb lay in the earth , the bulb lay in me ; it became my heart , my living heart , such as i had never before possessed . there was life in me , power and might . the heart pulsed , and the bulb put forth sprouts ; it was the springing up of thoughts and feelings which burst forth into flower .
