when they retired to rest the princess feared lest jack should kiss her because of his prickles , but he told her not to be alarmed as no harm should befall her . then he begged the old king to place a watch of four men just outside his bedroom door , and to desire them to make a big fire . when he was about to lie down in bed he would creep out of his hedgehog skin , and leave it lying at the bedside ; then the men must rush in , throw the skin into the fire , and stand by till it was entirely burnt up . and so it was , for when it struck eleven , jack my hedgehog went to his room , took off his skin and left it at the foot of the bed . the men rushed in , quickly seized the skin and threw it on the fire , and directly it was all burnt jack was released from his enchantment and lay in his bed a man from head to foot , but quite black as though he had been severely scorched .
