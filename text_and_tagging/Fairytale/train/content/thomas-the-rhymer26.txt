fourteen long years went by , and people were beginning to forget that thomas the rhymer had ever been in fairy - land ; but at last a day came when scotland was at war with england , and the scottish army was resting by the banks of the tweed , not far from the tower of ercildoune . and the master of the tower determined to make a feast , and invite all the nobles and barons who were leading the army to sup with him . that feast was long remembered . for the laird of ercildoune took care that everything was as magnificent as it could possibly be ; and when the meal was ended he rose in his place , and , taking his elfin harp , he sang to his assembled guests song after song of the days of long ago .
