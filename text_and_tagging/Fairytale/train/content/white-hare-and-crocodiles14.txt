when the hare had finished his story , the man was full of pity towards him , and said : " i am very sorry for all you have suffered , but remember , it was only the consequence of the deceit you practiced on the crocodiles . " " i know , " answered the sorrowful hare , " but i have repented and made up my mind never to use deceit again . i beg you to show me how i may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again . " " then i will tell you of a good remedy , " said the man . " first go and bathe well in that pond over there and try to wash all the salt from your body . then pick some of those kaba flowers that are growing near the edge of the water . spread them on the ground and roll yourself on them . if you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again , and you will be quite well in a little while . " the hare was very glad to be told what to do , so kindly . he crawled to the pond pointed out to him , bathed well in it . he then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water , and rolled himself on them . to his amazement , even while he was doing this , he saw his nice white fur growing again . the pain ceased , and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes . the hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery . he went hopping joyfully towards the young man who had so helped him , and kneeling down at his feet , said : " i can not express my thanks for all you have done for me ! it is my earnest wish to do something for you in return . please tell me who you are ? " " i am no king 's son as you think me . i am a fairy , and my name is okuni - nushi - no - mikoto , " answered the man . " those beings who passed here before me are my brothers . they have heard of a beautiful princess called yakami who lives in this province of inaba , and they are on their way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them . but on this expedition i am only an attendant , so i am walking behind them with this great big bag on my back .
