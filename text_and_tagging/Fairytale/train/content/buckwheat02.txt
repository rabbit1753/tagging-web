i will tell you what the sparrow told me , and the sparrow heard it from an aged willow which stood -- and still stands for that matter -- close to the field of buckwheat . this willow is tall and venerable , though old and crippled . its trunk is split clear through the middle , and grass and blackberry tendrils creep out through the cleft . the tree bends forward , and its branches droop like long , green hair .
