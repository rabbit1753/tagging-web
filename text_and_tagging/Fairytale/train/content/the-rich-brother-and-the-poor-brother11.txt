in this way the years went on , but the crops were not so good as they had been , and the old man gave orders that some fine houses he was building in the city should be left unfinished , for it would take all the savings to complete them . as to the elder son , he would never even hear his name mentioned , and died at last without ever seeing his face , leaving to the younger , as he had promised , all his lands , as well as his money . meanwhile , the son whom he had disinherited had grown poorer and poorer . he and his wife were always looking out for something to do , and never spent a penny that they could help , but luck was against them , and at the time of his father 's death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes to cover them . if there had been only himself , he would have managed to get on somehow , but he could not bear to watch his children becoming weaker day by day , and swallowing his pride , at length he crossed the mountains to his old home where his brother was living .
