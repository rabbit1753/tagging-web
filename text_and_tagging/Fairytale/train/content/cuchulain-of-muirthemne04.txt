and when the dark night was coming on , conchubar said to his people , " it is best for us to unyoke the chariots now , and to look for some place where we can spend the night . " then fergus went forward to look for some place , and what he came to was a very small poor - looking house . a man and a woman were in it , and when they saw him they said , " bring your companions here along with you , and they will be welcome . " fergus went back to his companions and told them what he had seen . but bricriu said : " where is the use of going into a house like that , with neither room nor provisions nor coverings in it . it is not worth our while to be going there . " then bricriu went on himself to the place where the house was . but when he came to it , what he saw was a grand , new , well - lighted house . at the door there was a young man wearing armour , very tall and handsome and shining . and he said , " come into the house , bricriu . why are you looking about you ? " and there was a young woman beside him , fine and noble , and with curled hair , and she said , " surely there is a welcome before you from me . " " why does she welcome me ? " said bricriu . " it is on account of her that i myself welcome you , " said the young man . " and is there no one missing from you at emain ? " he said . " there is , surely , " said bricriu . " we are missing fifty young girls for the length of a year . " " would you know them again if you saw them ? " said the young man . " if i would not know them , " said bricriu , " it is because a year might make a change in them , so that i would not be sure . "
