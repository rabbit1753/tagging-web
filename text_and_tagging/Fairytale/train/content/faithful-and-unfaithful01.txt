once upon a time there was a couple of humble cottagers who had no children until , at last , the man 's wife was blessed with a boy , which made both of them very happy . they named him faithful and when he was christened a huldra came to the hut , seated herself beside the child 's cradle , and foretold that he would meet with good fortune . " what is more , " she said , " when he is fifteen years of age , i will make him a present of a horse with many rare qualities , a horse that has the gift of speech ! " and with that the huldra turned and went away .
