after a time mr . john dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles . but they did not keep " self - fitting sixes " ; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle . besides -- the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather . and miss dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints . and when mr . john dormouse was complained to , he stayed in bed , and would say nothing but " very snug ; " which is not the way to carry on a retail business .
