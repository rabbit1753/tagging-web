" have you all heard the rumor that every evening after sunset there comes an ogre to the gate of rashomon , and that he seizes all who pass by ? " the second knight , watanabe , answered him , saying : " do not talk such nonsense ! all the ogres were killed by our chief raiko at oeyama ! it can not be true , because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to show themselves in this city , for they know that our brave master would at once attack them if he knew that any of them were still alive ! " " then do you disbelieve what i say , and think that i am telling you a falsehood ? " " no , i do not think that you are telling a lie , " said watanabe ; " but you have heard some old woman 's story which is not worth believing . " " then the best plan is to prove what i say , by going there yourself and finding out yourself whether it is true or not , " said hojo .
