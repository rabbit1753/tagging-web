once upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons . he fell very ill , sent for doctors of every kind , even bonesetters , but they , none of them , could find out what was the matter with him , or even give him any relief . at last there came a foreign doctor , who declared that the golden blackbird alone could cure the sick man . so the old lord despatched his eldest son to look for the wonderful bird , and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bring it back .
