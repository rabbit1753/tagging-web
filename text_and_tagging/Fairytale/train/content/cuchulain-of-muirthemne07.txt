so they rested there that night , and in the morning conchubar was the first to rise up . he saw no more of the man of the house , and what he heard was the cry of a child . and he went to the room it came from , and there he saw dechtire , and her maidens about her , and a young child beside her . and she bade conchubar welcome , and she told him all that had happened her , and that she had called him there to bring herself and the child back to emain macha . and conchubar said , " it is well you have done by me , dechtire . you gave shelter to me and to my chariots . you kept the cold from my horses . you gave food to me and my people , and now you have given us this good gift . and let our sister , finchoem , bring up the child , " he said . " no , it is not for her to bring him up , it is for me , " said sencha , son of ailell , chief judge and chief poet of ulster . " for i am skilled . i am good in disputes . i am not forgetful . i speak before anyone at all in the presence of the king . i watch over what he says . i give judgment in the quarrels of kings . i am judge of the men of ulster . no one has a right to dispute my claim , but only conchubar . " " if the child is given to me to bring up , " said blai , the distributor , " he will not suffer from want of care or from forgetfulness . it is my messages that do the will of conchubar . i call up the fighting men from all ireland . i am well able to provide for them for a week , or even for ten days . i settle their business and their disputes . i support their honour . i get satisfaction for their insults .
