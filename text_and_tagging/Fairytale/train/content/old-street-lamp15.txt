there lay the lamp in the great armchair near the warm stove . it seemed almost to have grown larger , for it appeared quite to fill the chair . the old people sat at their supper , casting friendly glances at it , and would willingly have admitted it to a place at the table . it is quite true that they dwelt in a cellar two yards below ground , and had to cross a stone passage to get to their room . but within , it was warm and comfortable , and strips of list had been nailed round the door . the bed and the little window had curtains , and everything looked clean and neat . on the window seat stood two curious flowerpots , which a sailor named christian had brought from the east or west indies . they were of clay , and in the form of two elephants with open backs ; they were filled with earth , and through the open space flowers bloomed . in one grew some very fine chives or leeks ; this was the kitchen garden . the other , which contained a beautiful geranium , they called their flower garden .
