as jack had but little money , he went on as fast as possible . at length he came to a handsome house . jack knocked at the door , when there came forth a welsh giant . jack said he was a traveler who had lost his way , on which the giant made him welcome , and let him into a room where there was a good bed to sleep in . jack took off his clothes quickly , but though he was weary he could not go to sleep . soon after this he heard the giant walking backward and forward in the next room , and saying to himself : " though here you lodge with me this night , you shall not see the morning light ; my club shall dash your brains out quite .
