once upon a time there dwelt in the land of erin a young man who was seeking a wife . of all the maidens round about none pleased him as well as the only daughter of a farmer . the girl was willing and the father was willing . very soon they were married and went to live at the farm . by and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and pile them up to dry , so that they might have fires in the winter . so on a fine day the girl and her husband , and the father and his wife all went out upon the moor .
