the king and queen had only one child , a prince who was still small ; yet great in promise . now when the king had gone , it chanced one day that the little fellow was wandering about the royal courtyard , and came to the wild man 's cage . and he began to play with an apple of gold he had . and while he was playing with it , it happened that suddenly the apple fell through the window in the wall of the cage . the wild man at once appeared and threw back the apple . this seemed a merry game to the little fellow : he threw the apple in again , and the wild man threw it out again , and thus they played for a long time . yet for all the game had been so pleasant , it turned to sorrow in the end : for the wild man kept the apple of gold , and would not give it back again . and when all was of no avail , neither threats nor prayers , the little fellow at last began to weep .
