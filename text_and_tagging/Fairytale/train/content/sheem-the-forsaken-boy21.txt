owasso himself reached home in safety , proof against all kinds of weather , and the magic canoe became the exclusive property of the young man and his wife . during all this part of owasso 's stay at the lodge of mishosha , his sister , whom he had left on the main land with sheem , their younger brother , had labored with good - will to supply the lodge . she knew enough of the arts of the forest to provide their daily food . she watched her little brother , and tended his wants , with all of a good sister 's care . by times she began to be weary of solitude and of her charge . no one came to be a witness of her constancy , or to let fall a single word in her mother - tongue . she could not converse with the birds and beasts about her , and she felt , to the bottom of her heart , that she was alone . in these thoughts she forgot her younger brother . she almost wished him dead ; for it was he alone that kept her from seeking the companionship of others . one day , after collecting all the provisions she had been able to reserve from their daily use , and bringing a supply of wood to the door , she said to her little brother : " my brother , you must not stray from the lodge . i am going to seek our elder brother . i shall be back soon .
