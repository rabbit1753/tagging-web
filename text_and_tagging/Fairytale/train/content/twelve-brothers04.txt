then they went their way deeper into the wood , and in the middle of it , where it was thickest and darkest , they came upon a little enchanted house which stood empty . ' here , ' they said , ' let us take up our abode , and you , benjamin , you are the youngest and weakest , you shall stay at home and keep house for us ; we others will go out and fetch food . ' so they went forth into the wood , and shot hares and roe - deer , birds and wood - pigeons , and any other game they came across . they always brought their spoils home to benjamin , who soon learnt to make them into dainty dishes . so they lived for ten years in this little house , and the time slipped merrily away .
