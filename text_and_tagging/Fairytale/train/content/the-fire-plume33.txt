wassamo was living with his parents on the shore of a large bay , far out in the north - east . one day , when the season had commenced for fish to be plenty , the mother of wassamo said to him , " my son , i wish you would go to yonder point and see if you can not procure me some fish ; and ask your cousin to accompany you . " he did so . they set out , and in the course of the afternoon they arrived at the fishing - ground . the cousin , being the elder , attended to the nets , and they encamped near by , using the bark of the birch for a lodge to shelter them through the night . they lit a fire , and while they sat conversing with each other , the moon arose . not a breath of wind disturbed the smooth surface of the lake . not a cloud was seen . wassamo looked out on the water toward their nets , and he saw that the little black spots , which were no other than the floats , dotting the lake , had disappeared . " cousin , " he said , " let us visit our nets ; perhaps we are fortunate . "
