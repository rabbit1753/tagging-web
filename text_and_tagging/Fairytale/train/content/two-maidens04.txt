" maiden is a human name , but hand - rammer is a thing , and we wo n't be called things -- that 's insulting us . " " my lover would be ready to give up his engagement , " said the youngest , who was betrothed to a paver 's hammer ; and the hammer is the thing which drives great piles into the earth , like a machine , and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar way . " he wants to marry me as a maiden , but whether he would have me were i a hand - rammer is a question , so i wo n't have my name changed . " " and i , " said the elder one , " would rather have both my arms broken off . "
