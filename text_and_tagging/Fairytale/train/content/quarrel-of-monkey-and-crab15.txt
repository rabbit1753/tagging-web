you can imagine the feelings of the poor crab after waiting patiently , for so long as he had done , for the tree to grow and the fruit to ripen , when he saw the monkey devouring all the good persimmons . he was so disappointed that he ran round and round the tree calling to the monkey to remember his promise . the monkey at first took no notice of the crab 's complaints , but at last he picked out the hardest , greenest persimmon he could find and aimed it at the crab 's head . the persimmon is as hard as stone when it is unripe . the monkey 's missile struck home and the crab was sorely hurt by the blow . again and again , as fast as he could pick them , the monkey pulled off the hard persimmons and threw them at the defenseless crab till he dropped dead , covered with wounds all over his body . there he lay a pitiful sight at the foot of the tree he had himself planted .
