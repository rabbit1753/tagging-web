when he had come into the village , he told them how wassamo had disappeared . he stated all the circumstances . he kept nothing to himself . he declared all that he knew . some said , " he has killed him in the dark . " others said , " it is impossible ; they were like brothers ; they would have fallen for each other . it can not be . " at the cousin 's request , many of the men visited the fish - fire . there were no marks of blood . no hasty steps were there to show that any conflict or struggle had occurred . every leaf on every tree was in its place ; and they saw , as the cousin had before , that the foot - prints of wassamo stopped in the wood , as if he had gone no further upon the earth , but had ascended into the air . they returned to the village , and no man was the wiser as to the strange and sudden vanishing of wassamo . none ever looked to see him more ; only the parents , who still hoped and awaited his return .
