now , there are among us human creatures certain individuals who are known as " emancipated women , " as , for instance , principals of institutions , dancers who stand professionally on one leg , milliners , and sick - nurses ; and with this class of emancipated women the two maidens in the shed associated themselves . they were " maidens " among the paver folk , and determined not to give up this honorable appellation , and let themselves be miscalled " rammers . " " maiden is a human name , but hand - rammer is a thing , and we wo n't be called things -- that 's insulting us . " " my lover would be ready to give up his engagement , " said the youngest , who was betrothed to a paver 's hammer ; and the hammer is the thing which drives great piles into the earth , like a machine , and therefore does on a large scale what ten maidens effect in a similar way . " he wants to marry me as a maiden , but whether he would have me were i a hand - rammer is a question , so i wo n't have my name changed . " " and i , " said the elder one , " would rather have both my arms broken off . "
