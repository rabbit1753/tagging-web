long , long ago , one bright autumn day in japan , it happened , that a pink - faced monkey and a yellow crab were playing together along the bank of a river . as they were running about , the crab found a rice - dumpling and the monkey a persimmon - seed . the crab picked up the rice - dumpling and showed it to the monkey , saying : " look what a nice thing i have found ! " then the monkey held up his persimmon - seed and said : " i also have found something good ! look ! "
