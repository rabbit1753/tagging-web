hidesato felt very sorry for the dragon king on hearing his story , and readily promised to do what he could to help him . the warrior asked where the centipede lived , so that he might attack the creature at once . the dragon king replied that its home was on the mountain mikami , but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake , it would be better to wait till then . so hidesato was conducted to the palace of the dragon king , under the bridge . strange to say , as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass , and his clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood . never had hidesato seen anything so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake . he had often heard of the sea king 's palace at the bottom of the sea , where all the servants and retainers were salt - water fishes , but here was a magnificent building in the heart of lake biwa . the dainty goldfishes , red carp , and silvery trout , waited upon the dragon king and his guest .
