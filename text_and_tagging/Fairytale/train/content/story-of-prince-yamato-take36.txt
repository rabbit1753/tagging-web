but the heart of the prince was full of war and conquest and he cared little for the faithful ototachibana . from long exposure in traveling , and from care and grief at her lord 's coldness to her , her beauty had faded , and her ivory skin was burnt brown by the sun , and the prince told her one day that her place was in the palace behind the screens at home and not with him upon the warpath . but in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband 's part , ototachibana could not find it in her heart to leave him . but perhaps it would have been better for her if she had done so , for on the way to idzu , when they came to owari , her heart was well - nigh broken .
