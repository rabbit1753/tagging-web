the presents which he had received from the grateful dragon king were found to be of magic power . the bell only was ordinary , and as hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the temple near by , where it was hung up , to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood . the single bag of rice , however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight and his whole family , never grew less - the supply in the bag was inexhaustible . the roll of silk , too , never grew shorter , though time after time long pieces were cut off to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to court in at the new year . the cooking pot was wonderful , too . no matter what was put into it , it cooked deliciously whatever was wanted without any firing - truly a very economical saucepan . the fame of hidesato 's fortune spread far and wide , and as there was no need for him to spend money on rice or silk or firing , he became very rich and prosperous , and was henceforth known as my lord bag of rice .
