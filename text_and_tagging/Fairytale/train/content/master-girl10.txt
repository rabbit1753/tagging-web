now when the giant had been sleeping quite a while , he began to stretch himself on his bench . " is dinner ready yet ? " he asked . " just begun!"said the first drop of blood on the bench . then the giant turned around , went to sleep again , and went on sleeping for quite some time . then he again turned around a little . " is dinner not ready yet ? " he said , but did not open his eyes -- nor had he done so the first time -- for he was still half asleep . " it is half ready ! " called out the second drop of blood , and then the giant thought it was the master girl . he turned around on the bench and took another nap . after he had slept a couple of hours longer , he once more began to move about and stretch : " is dinner still not ready ? " said he . " ready ! " answered the third drop of blood . the giant sat up and rubbed his eyes . but he could not see who had called him , and so he called out to the master girl . but no one answered him . " o , i suppose she has gone out for a little , " thought the giant , and he dipped his spoon in the kettle to try the dinner . but there was nothing but leather soles and rags and like rubbish cooked together , and he did not know whether it were mush or porridge . when he noticed this he began to see a light , and realize how matters had come to pass . he grew so angry that he hardly knew what to do , and made after the king 's son and the master girl in flying haste .
