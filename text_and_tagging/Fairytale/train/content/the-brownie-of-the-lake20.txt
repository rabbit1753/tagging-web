when all was ready , the dwarfs , in new green suits , came bustling in , very happy and merry , and took their seats at the table . but in a moment they all sprang up with a cry , and ran away screaming , for barbaik had placed pans of hot coals under their feet , and all their poor little toes were burnt . 'you wo n't forget that in a hurry , ' she said , smiling grimly to herself , but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water , which they poured on the fire . then they joined hands and danced round it , singing : wicked traitress , barne riou , our poor toes are burned by you ; now we hurry from your hall-- bad luck light upon you all .
