finally , they discovered the young fellow , and begged him to give them back their feathers . " but why do you dance in our wheat - field ? " said the young fellow . " alas , it is not our fault , " said the maidens . " the troll who has enchanted us sends us here every saturday night to trample the field . but now give us our feathers , for morning is near . " and they begged for them in the sweetest way . " i do not know about that , " said the young fellow , " you have trampled down the field so very badly ; perhaps if i might choose and have one of you ? " " that would please us , " returned the maidens , " but it would not be possible ; for three trolls guard us , one with three , one with six and one with nine heads , and they kill all who come to the mountain . " but the young fellow said that one of them pleased him so very much that he would make the attempt , in spite of what they had told him . so he chose the middle one , for she seemed the most beautiful to him , and she gave him a ring and put it on his finger . and then the maidens at once put on their garments of dove feathers , and flew back across forest and hill .
