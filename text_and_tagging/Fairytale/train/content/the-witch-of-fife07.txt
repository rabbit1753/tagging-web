and how , after that , a wee , wee man had jumped up from under a great mossy stone , with a tiny set of bagpipes under his arm , and how he had piped such wonderful music , that , at the sound of it , the very trouts jumped out of the loch below , and the stoats crept out of their holes , and the corby crows and the herons came and sat on the trees in the darkness , to listen . and how all the witches danced until they were so weary that , when the time came for them to mount their steeds again , if they would be home before cock - crow , they could scarce sit on them for fatigue .
