when he got back , he showed the arm to his comrades , who one and all called him the hero of their band and gave him a great feast . his wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in kyoto , and people from far and near came to see the ogre 's arm . watanabe now began to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety , for he knew that the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive . he felt sure that one day or other , as soon as the ogre got over his scare , he would come to try to get his arm back again . watanabe therefore had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron . in this he placed the arm , and then he sealed down the heavy lid , refusing to open it for anyone . he kept the box in his own room and took charge of it himself , never allowing it out of his sight . now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch , asking for admittance . when the servant went to the door to see who it was , there was only an old woman , very respectable in appearance . on being asked who she was and what was her business , the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby . if the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him .
