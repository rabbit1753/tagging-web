it was late in autumn and all the trees had shed their leaves , but no sooner did the ashes touch their branches than the cherry trees , the plum trees , and all other blossoming shrubs burst into bloom . the old man 's garden was suddenly transformed into a beautiful picture of spring . the old man 's delight knew no bounds , and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes . the story of the old man 's garden spread far and wide , and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight .
