for three days they flew straight as an arrow , until they came to scattered houses , to villages , and to cities . then their search began . the gulls were brave , and cunning , and wise . upon the fourth day they reached the great metropolis , and hovered over the streets until a carriage rolled along with a great white bear robe thrown over the back seat . then the birds swooped down - the whole hundred of them - and seizing the skin in their beaks flew quickly away . they were late . the king 's great battle was upon the seventh day , and they must fly swiftly to reach the polar regions by that time . meanwhile the bird - bear was preparing for his fight . he sharpened his claws in the small crevasses of the ice . he caught a seal and tested his big yellow teeth by crunching its bones between them . and the queen gull set her band to pluming the king bear 's feathers until they lay smoothly upon his body . but every day they cast anxious glances into the southern sky , watching for the hundred gulls to bring back the king 's own skin . the seventh day came , and all the polar bears in that region gathered around the king 's cavern . among them was woof , strong and confident of his success . " the bird - bear 's feathers will fly fast enough when i get my claws upon him ! " he boasted ; and the others laughed and encouraged him . the king was disappointed at not having recovered his skin , but he resolved to fight bravely without it . he advanced from the opening of his cavern with a proud and kingly bearing , and when he faced his enemy he gave so terrible a growl that woof 's heart stopped beating for a moment , and he began to realize that a fight with the wise and mighty king of his race was no laughing matter .
