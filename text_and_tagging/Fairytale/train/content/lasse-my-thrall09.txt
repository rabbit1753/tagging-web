the soldiers assembled in the greatest haste and set forth . the drummers beat their drums and the trumpeters blew their trumpets , and the other musicians practiced their art , each in his own way ; so that the duke heard them long before they came in sight . but this was not the first time he had heard music of this sort , and he knew what it meant , so once more he took up the scrap of paper : " lasse , my thrall ! " " what does my master command ? " " there are soldiers coming , " said he , " and now you must provide me with soldiers and horsemen until i have twice as many as the folk on the other side of the forest . and sabers and pistols and muskets and cannon , and all that goes with them -- but you must be quick about it ! "
