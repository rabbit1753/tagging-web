liu i answered : " your words have moved my heart . would that i had wings and could fly away with you . i will be glad to deliver the letter to your father . yet the sea of dungting is long and broad , and how am i to find him ? " " on the southern shore of the sea stands an orange - tree , " answered the woman , " which people call the tree of sacrifice . when you get there you must loosen your girdle and strike the tree with it three times in succession . then some one will appear whom you must follow . when you see my father , tell him in what need you found me , and that i long greatly for his help .
