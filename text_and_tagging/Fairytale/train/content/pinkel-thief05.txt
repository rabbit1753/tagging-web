' and they all got in and rowed across in the direction of the light . as they drew near the island they saw that it came from a golden lantern hanging over the door of a hut , while sweet tinkling music proceeded from some bells attached to the golden horns of a goat which was feeding near the cottage . the young men 's hearts rejoiced as they thought that at last they would be able to rest their weary limbs , and they entered the hut , but were amazed to see an ugly old woman inside , wrapped in a cloak of gold which lighted up the whole house . they looked at each other uneasily as she came forward with her daughter , as they knew by the cloak that this was a famous witch .
