the princess made a sour enough face at this , but , as the gooseherd would take nothing more nor less than what he had said , she and her maids had to tuck up their dresses and go up on the hill ; there she paid him his price , and brought home the silver looking - glass and the golden comb . the lad clasped the necklace about his throat , and , dear , dear , how all the folks did goggle and stare . " see , " said they , " the princess has been giving the gooseherd the necklace from about her own throat . " the third day it was a new thing the gooseherd had , for he brought out a musical box with figures on it , dressed up , and looking for all the world like real little men and women . he turned the handle , and when the music played it was sweeter than drops of honey . and all the while the little men and women bowed to one another and went through with a dance , for all the world as though they knew what they were about , and were doing it with their own wits .
