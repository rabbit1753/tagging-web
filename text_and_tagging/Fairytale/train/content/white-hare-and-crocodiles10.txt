the hare was now in a pitiful plight , all his beautiful white fur had been pulled out . his bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over . he could hardly move . all he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had befallen him . despite that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and suffering upon the white hare of inaba , any one seeing the poor little creature could not help feeling sorry for him in his sad condition . the crocodiles had been very cruel in their revenge . just at this time a number of men , who looked like king 's sons , happened to pass by . seeing the hare lying on the beach crying , they stopped and asked what was the matter . the hare lifted up his head from between his paws , and answered them , saying : " i had a fight with some crocodiles , but i was beaten . they pulled out all my fur and left me to suffer here - that is why i am crying .
