" i wish i might be back at the house at home ! " said halvor , and his wish was at once realized , and he was standing in front of his parents ' house before he knew it . it was dusk , and when the old folk saw such a handsome , well - dressed stranger coming , it embarrassed them so that it seemed as though their bowing and scraping would never end . halvor now asked them whether they could not give him a night 's lodging . " no , they really could not do so , for they were quite unprepared for it , " said they , " and we are lacking one thing , and another , which such a distinguished gentleman would wish to have . it would be best if the gentleman went up to the castle , whose chimney he can see from here , where the folk are well prepared . " " no , " said halvor , " i 'll not go there until to - morrow morning . and now let me stay here overnight . i will be content to sit by the hearth . " the old folk could make no objection to this , and so halvor sat down by the hearth , and began to dig in the ashes , as he used to when he was the lazybones at home . then they chatted about all sorts of matters , and told halvor about one thing and another , and finally he asked them whether they had no children . yes , they had a son ; but did not know whither he had wandered , or even whether he were still alive , or already dead .
