in the old days there lived in kvam a marksman by the name of per gynt . he was continually in the mountains , where he shot bear and elk . at that time there were more forests on the fjoll , and all sorts of beasts dwelt in them . once , late in the fall , when the cattle had long since been driven down from the mountain pastures , per gynt decided to go up on the fjoll again . with the exception of three dairy - maids , all the herd - folk had already left the mountains . but when per gynt reached hovringalm , where he intended to stay over - night in a herdsman 's hut , it already was so dark that he could not see his hand before his eyes . then the dogs began to bark so violently that he felt quite uneasy . and suddenly his foot struck something . when he took hold of it , it was cold , and large and slippery . since he felt certain he had not left the path , he could not imagine what it might be ; but he sensed that all was not in order .
