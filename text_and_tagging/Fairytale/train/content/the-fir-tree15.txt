' what are they doing ? ' thought the tree . ' what is going to happen ? ' and the tapers burnt low on the branches , and were put out one by one , and then the children were given permission to plunder the tree . they rushed at it so that all its boughs creaked ; if it had not been fastened by the gold star at the top to the ceiling , it would have been overthrown . the children danced about with their splendid toys , and no one looked at the tree , except the old nurse , who came and peeped amongst the boughs , just to see if a fig or an apple had been forgotten . ' a story ! a story ! ' cried the children , and dragged a little stout man to the tree ; he sat down beneath it , saying , ' here we are in the greenwood , and the tree will be delighted to listen ! but i am only going to tell one story . shall it be henny penny or humpty dumpty who fell downstairs , and yet gained great honour and married a princess ? ' ' henny penny ! ' cried some ; ' humpty dumpty ! ' cried others ; there was a perfect babel of voices ! only the fir - tree kept silent , and thought , ' am i not to be in it ? am i to have nothing to do with it ? '
