" my curse upon you ! " she exclaimed , " you 've disgraced me . i now change you into a grey stone . lie there as a testimony of what has happened , and may evil betide the first living man that will ever attempt to move or injure you ! " and , sure enough , there it lies to this day , with the mark of the four fingers and thumb imprinted on it , exactly as it came out of her hand . " never mind , " said granua , " i must only do the best i can with far rua . if all fail , i 'll give him a cast of heather broth , or a panada of oak bark . but , above all things , think of some plan to get finn out of the scrape he 's in , or he 's a lost man . you know you used to be sharp and ready - witted ; and my own opinion is , oonagh , that it will go hard with you , or you 'll outdo far rua yet . " she then made a high smoke on the top of the hill , after which she put her finger in her mouth and gave three whistles , and by that far rua knew that he was invited to the top of cullamore -- for this was the way that the irish long ago gave a sign to all strangers and travellers to let them know they are welcome to come and take share of whatever was going .
