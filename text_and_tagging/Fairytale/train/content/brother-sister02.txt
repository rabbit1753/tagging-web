the next morning , when they awoke , the sun was high in heaven , and shone brightly through the leaves . then said the brother , " sister , i am thirsty ; if i only knew where to find a brook , that i might go and drink ! i almost think that i hear one rushing . " so the brother got down and led his sister by the hand , and they went to seek the brook . but their wicked stepmother was a witch , and had known quite well that the two children had run away , and had sneaked after them , as only witches can , and had laid a spell on all the brooks in the forest . so when they found a little stream flowing smoothly over its pebbles , the brother was going to drink of it ; but the sister heard how it said in its rushing , " he a tiger will be who drinks of me , who drinks of me a tiger will be ! " then the sister cried , " pray , dear brother , do not drink , or you will become a wild beast , and will tear me in pieces . "
