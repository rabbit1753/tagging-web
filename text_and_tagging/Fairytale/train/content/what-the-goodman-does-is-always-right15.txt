" yes , but i exchanged the fowl for a sack of shriveled apples . " " what ! i must really give you a kiss for that ! " exclaimed the wife . " my dear , good husband , now i 'll tell you something . do you know , almost as soon as you left me this morning , i began thinking of what i could give you nice for supper this evening , and then i thought of fried eggs and bacon , with sweet herbs . i had eggs and bacon but lacked the herbs , so i went over to the schoolmaster 's . i knew they had plenty of herbs , but the schoolmistress is very mean , although she can smile so sweetly . i begged her to lend me a handful of herbs . ' lend ! ' she exclaimed , ' i have nothing to lend . i could not even lend you a shriveled apple , my dear woman . ' but now i can lend her ten , or a whole sackful , for which i 'm very glad . it makes me laugh to think of it . " then she gave him a hearty kiss .
