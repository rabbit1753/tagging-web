" i have no doubt you are right , brother peepi , " rejoined gray eagle . " i know this pirate -- his name is white owl ; and now that i feel my strength fully recovered , i will go out with you to - morrow and help you look after this greedy bush - ranger . " the next day they went forth in company , and arrived at a fine fresh - water lake . gray eagle seated himself hard by , while peepi started out , and soon pounced upon a duck . " well done ! " thought his brother , who saw his success ; but just as little peepi was getting to land with his prize , up sailed a large white owl from a tree where he , too , had been watching , and laid claim to it . he was on the point of wresting it from peepi , when gray eagle , calling out to the intruder to desist , rushed up , and , fixing his talons in both sides of the owl , without further introduction or ceremony , flew away with him .
