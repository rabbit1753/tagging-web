one can imagine what joy there was when the two reached home . everyone had been looking for them , and the big sister had not been able to sleep , for she thought the wolves had eaten them up . otto met them ; he had a basket in his hand and said : ' look , here is something that an old man has just left for you . ' when the girls looked into the basket they saw a pair of most beautiful bracelets of precious stones , dark red , and made in the shape of a ripe raspberry and with an inscription : ' to lisa and aina ' ; beside them there was a diamond breast pin in the shape of a raspberry worm : on it was inscribed ' otto , never destroy the helpless ! ' otto felt rather ashamed : he quite understood what it meant , but he thought that the old man 's revenge was a noble one . the raspberry king had also remembered the big sister , for when she went in to set the table for dinner , she found eleven big baskets of most beautiful raspberries , and no one knew how they had come there , but everyone guessed . and so there was such a jam - making as had never been seen before , and if you like to go and help in it , you might perhaps get a little , for they must surely be making jam still to this very day .
