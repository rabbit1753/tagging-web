when the wicked monkey saw that he had killed the crab he ran away from the spot as fast as he could , in fear and trembling , like a coward as he was . now the crab had a son who had been playing with a friend not far from the spot where this sad work had taken place . on the way home he came across his father dead , in a most dreadful condition - his head was smashed and his shell broken in several places , and around his body lay the unripe persimmons which had done their deadly work . at this dreadful sight the poor young crab sat down and wept .
