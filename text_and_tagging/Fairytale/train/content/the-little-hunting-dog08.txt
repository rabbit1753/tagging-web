after him came a great throng of footmen and horsemen , several hundred in all . and they had hunting falcons and hunting dogs by the hundred , too . then the fleas and gnats began to rise in the air ; but were all slain by the falcons . and the hunting dogs climbed on the bed , and sniffed along the walls trailing the fleas , and ate them up . they followed the trace of whatever hid in the cracks , and nosed it out , so that in a short space of time they had killed nearly all the vermin . the scholar pretended to be asleep and watched them . and the falcons settled down on him , and the dogs crawled along his body . shortly after came a man clad in yellow , wearing a king 's crown , who climbed on an empty couch and seated himself there . and at once all the horsemen rode up , descended from their horses and brought him all the birds and game . they then gathered beside him in a great throng , and conversed with him in a strange tongue .
