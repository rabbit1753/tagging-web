the little lady was a dancer , and she stretched out both her arms , and raised one of her legs so high , that the tin soldier could not see it at all , and he thought that she , like himself , had only one leg . " that is the wife for me , " he thought ; " but she is too grand , and lives in a castle , while i have only a box to live in , five - and - twenty of us altogether , that is no place for her . still i must try and make her acquaintance . " then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff - box that stood upon it , so that he could peep at the little delicate lady , who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance .
