after the wedding the newly married pairs were each to drive off to their castle . and the two older princesses each drove off in a splendidly decorated coach , with a large retinue , and all sorts of honors . but the youngest had to go afoot , since her husband , the dog , had neither coach nor driver . when they had wandered long and far , they came to a great forest , so great that it seemed endless ; but the dog limped along in advance , and the king 's daughter followed after , weeping . and as they went along she suddenly saw a magnificent castle lying before them , and round about it were beautiful meadows and green woods , all of them most enjoyable to see . the princess stopped and asked to whom the great mansion might belong .
