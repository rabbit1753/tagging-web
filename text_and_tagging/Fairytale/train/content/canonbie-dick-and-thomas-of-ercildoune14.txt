now was the time for canonbie dick to play the man . if he had done so all the rest of his life might have been different . but his courage failed him , and he lost his chance . terrified at seeing so many threatening faces turned towards him , he dropped the horn . he made one weak , undecided effort to pick up the sword . but , ere he could do so , a mysterious voice sounded from somewhere in the hall . these were the words that it uttered : " woe to the coward , that ever he was born , who did not draw the sword before he blew the horn . " and , before dick knew what he was about , a perfect whirlwind of cold , raw air tore through the cavern , carrying the luckless horse - dealer along with it . hurrying him along the narrow passage through which he had entered , dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and shale . he fell right to the bottom . he was found , with little life left in him , next morning , by some shepherds , he had just strength enough left to whisper the story of his weird and fearful adventure .
