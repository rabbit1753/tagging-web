the youth remained and was well received . the eagle said farewell and flew back to his native land . the youth asked for a drink , and he was at once handed a beaker containing a refreshing draught . when he had emptied it and returned the beaker , he let the golden band drop into it . and when the maid brought back the beaker to her mistress - who was the princess of the mount of the golden queen - the latter looked into the beaker , and behold , there lay a golden band which she recognized as her own . so she asked : " is there some one here ? " and when the maid answered in the affirmative , the princess said : " bid him come in ! . " as soon as the youth entered , she asked him if he chanced to have a letter . the youth drew out the letter he had received in so strange a manner , and gave it to the princess . and when she had read it she cried , full of joy : " now i am delivered ! " at that very moment the mountain turned into a most handsome castle , with all sorts of precious things , servants , and every sort of convenience , each for its own purpose . ( whether the princess and the youth married the story does not say ; yet we must take for granted that a wedding is the proper end for the fairy - tale ) .
