there was once a king who had three daughters . the two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome , but the youngest was as good as they were bad . well , three princes came to court them , and two of them were exactly like the eldest ladies , and one was just as lovable as the youngest . one day they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn when they met a poor beggar . the king would n't give him anything , and the eldest princesses would n't give him anything , nor their sweethearts ; but the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something , and kind words along with it , and that was better than all .
