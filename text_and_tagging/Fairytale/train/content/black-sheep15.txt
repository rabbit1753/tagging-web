it was a bright spring day , and the sun shone very warm and pleasant over the pastures , where the new grass was growing so juicy and tender that all the sheep thought they had never tasted anything so delicious . the sheep had had a strange experience that morning , for the farmer had taken them down to the brook and washed them , and then he tied their legs together and laid them on the grass and clipped all the heavy , soft wool from their bodies with a great pair of shears . the sheep did not like this very well , for every once in a while the shears would pull the wool and hurt them ; and when they were sheared they felt very strange , for it was almost as if someone took off all your clothes and let you run around naked . none of them were in a very good temper this morning , although the sun shone so warmly and the grass was so sweet , and as they watched the farmer and his man carry their wool up to the house in great bags , the old ram said , crossly , " i hope they are satisfied , now that they have stolen from us all our soft , warm fleece . " " what are they going to do with it ? " asked one of the sheep .
