in a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about , a money - box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe . it was made of clay in the shape of a pig , and had been bought of the potter . in the back of the pig was a slit , and this slit had been enlarged with a knife , so that dollars , or crown pieces , might slip through . indeed there were two in the box , besides a number of pence . the money - pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle , which is the highest state of perfection to which a money - pig can attain . there he stood upon the cupboard , high and lofty , looking down upon everything else in the room .
