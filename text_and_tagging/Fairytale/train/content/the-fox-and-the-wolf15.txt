so he made one excuse after another , but the wolf , who was getting more and more suspicious every moment , would not listen to him . so , as he had not courage to tell the truth , he was forced at last to swear an oath also , and this was what he swore : " if it be that i stole the butter ; if it be , if it be-- then let some most deadly punishment fall on me , fall on me-- whirrum wheeckam , whirrum wheeckam , whirram whee , whirram whee ! " after he had heard him swear this terrible oath , the wolf thought that his suspicions must be groundless , and he would have let the matter rest ; but the fox , having an uneasy conscience , could not do so . so he suggested that as it was clear that one of them must have eaten the keg of butter , they should both stand near the fire ; so that when they became hot , the butter would ooze out of the skin of whichever of them was guilty . and he took care that the wolf should stand in the hottest place . but the fire was big and the cave was small ; and while the poor lean wolf showed no sign of discomfort , he himself , being nice and fat and comfortable , soon began to get unpleasantly warm . as this did not suit him at all , he next proposed that they should go for a walk , " for , " said he , " it is now quite plain that neither of us can have taken the butter . it must have been some stranger who hath found out our secret .
