" you , sentaro , are fond of good living and of every comfort . you are not even like an ordinary man , for you are exceptionally idle . you more sensitive to heat and cold than most people . you would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time ! do you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit 's life ? " " in answer to your prayer , however , i will help you in another way . i will send you to the country of perpetual life , where death never comes - where the people live forever ! " saying this , jofuku put into sentaro 's hand a little crane made of paper , telling him to sit on its back and it would carry him there . sentaro obeyed wonderingly . the crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort . it then spread its wings , rose high in the air , and flew away over the mountains right out to sea . sentaro was at first quite frightened . by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight through the air . on and on they went for thousands of miles . the bird never stopped for rest or food , but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment , and strange to say , neither did sentaro . after several days they reached an island . the crane flew some distance inland and then alighted .
