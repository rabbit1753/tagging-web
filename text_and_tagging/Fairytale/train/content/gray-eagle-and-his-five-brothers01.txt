there were six falcons living in a nest , five of whom were still too young to fly , when it so happened that both the parent birds were shot in one day . the young brood waited anxiously for their return ; but night came , and they were left without parents and without food . gray eagle , the eldest , and the only one whose feathers had become stout enough to enable him to leave the nest , took his place at the head of the family , and assumed the duty of stifling their cries and providing the little household with food , in which he was very successful . but , after a short time had passed , by an unlucky mischance , while out on a foraging excursion , he got one of his wings broken .
