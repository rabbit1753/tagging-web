' ah ! i thought a second dose of that poison would be too much for you , ' said the witch looking at him . ' i warned you what would happen if you came back . i wish that all thieves were as dead as you ! but why does not my lazy girl bring the wood i sent her for , it will soon be too dark for her to find her way ? i suppose i must go and search for her . what a trouble girls are ! ' and she went to the door to watch if there were any signs of her daughter . but nothing could be seen of her , and heavy rain was falling . ' it is no night for my cloak , ' she muttered ; ' it would be covered with mud by the time i got back . ' so she took it off her shoulders and hung it carefully up in a cupboard in the room . after that she put on her clogs and started to seek her daughter . directly the last sound of the clogs had ceased , pinkel jumped up and took down the cloak , and rowed off as fast as he could .
