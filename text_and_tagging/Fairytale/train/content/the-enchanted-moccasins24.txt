this man 's name was ko - ko , the owl ; and hearing much of the wonderful achievements of the wearer of the ball , ko - ko put on a big look , and announced that he was going to do something extraordinary himself . onwee bahmondang , he said , had not half done his work , and he , ko - ko , meant to go on the ground and finish it up as it should be . he began by procuring an oak ball , which he thrust down his back , and , confident in its magical powers , he , too , called himself the wearer of the ball . in fact it was the self - same ball that onwee had employed , except that the magic had entirely gone out of it . coming by night in the shadow of the lodge , he thrust his arm in at the door , and stealthily possessed himself of the enchanted moccasins . he would have taken away onwee 's war - club too , if he could have carried it ; but although he was twice the size and girth of onwee , he had not the strength to lift it ; so he borrowed a club from an old chief , who was purblind , and mistook ko - ko for his brother who was a brave man ; and raising a terrible tumult with his voice , and a great dust with his heels , ko - ko set out . he had traveled all day , when he came to a small wigwam , and on looking into it , he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire ; just as onwee had before .
