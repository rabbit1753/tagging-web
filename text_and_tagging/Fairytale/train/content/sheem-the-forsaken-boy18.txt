he thought he would ponder deeply how he could employ that to the best advantage . it happened that while he was doing so , one evening , as owasso and his wife were sitting on the banks of the lake , and the soft breeze swept over it , they heard a song , as if sung by some one at a great distance . the sound continued for some time , and then died away in perfect stillness . " oh , it is the voice of sheem , " cried owasso . " it is the voice of my brother ! if i could but only see him ! " and he hung down his head in deep anguish . his wife witnessed his distress , and to comfort him she proposed that they should attempt to make their escape , and carry him succor on the morrow . when the morning came , and the sun shone warmly into the lodge , the wife of owasso offered to comb her father 's hair , with the hope that it would soothe him to sleep . it had that effect . they no sooner saw him in deep slumber than they seized the magic canoe , owasso uttered the charmed words , " chemaun poll ! " and they glided away upon the water without need of oar or sail .
