he made a second journey for the rolling - pin . he pushed it in front of him with his paws , like a brewer 's man trundling a barrel . he could hear ribby and tabitha talking , but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest . they did not see him . anna maria went down by way of the skirting - board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough . she borrowed a small saucer , and scooped up the dough with her paws . she did not observe moppet . while tom kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic , he wriggled about and tried to mew for help . but his mouth was full of soot and cob - webs , and he was tied up in such very tight knots , he could not make anybody hear him . except a spider , which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically , from a safe distance .
