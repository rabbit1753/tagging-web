a famous hunter who lived in a remote part of the north had a fair wife and two sons , who were left in the lodge every day while he went out in quest of the animals whose flesh was their principal support . game was very abundant in those days , and his labors in the chase were well rewarded . they lived a long distance from any other lodge , and it was seldom that they saw any other faces than those of their own household . the two sons were still too young to follow their father in the hunt , and they were in the habit of diverting themselves within reach of the lodge . while thus engaged , they began to take note that a young man visited the lodge during their father 's absence , and that these visits were constantly renewed . at length the elder of the two said to his mother : " my mother , who is this tall young man that comes here so often during our father 's absence ? does he wish to see him ? shall i tell him when he comes back this evening ?
