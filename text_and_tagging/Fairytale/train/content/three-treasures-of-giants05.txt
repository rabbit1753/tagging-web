towards evening they reached a small hut , and knocking at the door , asked if they might spend the night there . the man , who was a wood - cutter , invited them him , and begged them to sit down to supper . martin thanked him , but being very proud , explained that it was only shelter they wanted , as they had plenty of food with them ; and he and michael at once opened their bags and began to eat , while jack hid himself in a corner . the wife , on seeing this , took pity on him , and called him to come and share their supper , which he gladly did , and very good he found it . at this , martin regretted deeply that he had been so foolish as to refuse , for his bits of bread and cheese seemed very hard when he smelt the savoury soup his brother was enjoying . ' he sha n't have such a chance again , ' thought he ; and the next morning he insisted on plunging into a thick forest where they were likely to meet nobody .
