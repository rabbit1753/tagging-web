prince toyonari , after some weeks , came home , and was told by his wife that his daughter hime had done something wrong and had run away for fear of being punished . he was nearly ill with anxiety . every one in the house told the same story - that hase - hime had suddenly disappeared , none of them knew why or whither . for fear of scandal he kept the matter quiet and searched everywhere he could think of , but all to no purpose . one day , trying to forget his terrible worry , he called all his men together and told them to make ready for a several days ' hunt in the mountains . they were soon ready and mounted , waiting at the gate for their lord . he rode hard and fast to the district of the hibari mountains , a great company following him . he was soon far ahead of every one , and at last found himself in a narrow picturesque valley .
