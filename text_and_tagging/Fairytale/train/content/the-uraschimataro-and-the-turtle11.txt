uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads . oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea ! the young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls . but if uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales . ' where have you brought me ? ' he asked his guide in a low voice . ' to the palace of ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . ' i am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess otohime , whom you will shortly see . ' uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next . but the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival . and directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade . ' is not that reward enough ? ' she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself . and uraschimataro said ' yes , ' and so he stayed there . for how long ? that he only knew later .
