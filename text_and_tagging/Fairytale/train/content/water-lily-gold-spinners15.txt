but when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen , for , though the prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours , he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days . while they were wondering how they should reach his father 's court , they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank . in this they drove to the palace . the king and queen were at church , weeping for their son , whom they had long mourned for dead . great was their delight and astonishment when the prince entered , leading the beautiful maiden by the hand . the wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry - making throughout the kingdom for six weeks . some time afterward the prince and his bride were sitting in the garden , when a crow said to them : " ungrateful creatures ! have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress ? must they spin gold flax for ever ? have no pity on the old witch . the three maidens are princesses , whom she stole away when they were children together , with all the silver utensils , which she turned into gold flax . poison were her fittest punishment .
