when the queen heard these words she turned quite cold with rage . she knew that her husband had deceived her . she rose from her knees and went straight home to the palace . she hid her anger as best she could . she asked him if he would give orders to have the long ship made ready , as she wished to go and visit her dear step - daughter . it was such a very long time since she had seen her . the king was somewhat surprised at her request , but he was only too glad to think that she had got over her hatred towards his daughter . he gave orders that the long ship should be made ready at once . soon it was speeding over the water , its prow turned in the direction of the land where the princess lived , steered by the queen herself . she knew the course that the boat ought to take . she was in such haste to be at her journey 's end that she would allow no one else to take the helm .
