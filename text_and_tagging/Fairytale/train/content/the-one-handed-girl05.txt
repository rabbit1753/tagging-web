now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man , and he set out at once , and before dawn he had reached the hut , and saw the pot and the mortar were standing outside . he slung them over his shoulders and departed , pleased with his own cleverness ; but when his sister awoke and sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast , she could find it nowhere . at length she said to herself , ' well , some thief must have stolen them while i slept . i will go and see if any of my pumpkins are ripe . ' and indeed they were , and so many that the tree was almost broken by the weight of them . so she ate what she wanted and took the others to the village , and gave them in exchange for corn , and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these , and that she was to bring every day all that she had . in this way she earned more than she needed for herself , and soon was able to get another mortar and cooking pot in exchange for her corn . then she thought she was quite rich .
