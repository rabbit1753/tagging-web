then he slept again , and he saw a vision , to wit , that he was tossing in a ship at sea , and the ship floundered , and above his head a griffin , with sharp beak and talons , sailed , her wings outspread and covering all the sun , so that it was dark as middle - night ; and lo ! as she rose on high , her plumes quivered for a moment in the air ; then down she swooped and picked him from the waves , carrying him to her eyrie on the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean ; and the griffin began to pierce him and to prod him with her talons , and to pick out pieces of his flesh with her beak ; and this went on awhile , and then a flame , that came he knew not whence , rose from the nest , and he and the griffin were enveloped in the flame . then in her beak the griffin picked him up , and together they fell downward over the cliff 's edge into the seething ocean ; so that , half by fire and half by water , he died a miserable death .
