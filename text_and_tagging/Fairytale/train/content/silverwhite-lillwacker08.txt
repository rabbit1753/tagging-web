the two foster - brethren now wandered out into the world . after they had gone a while , they came to a dark forest . and in this forest they met a man , strange - looking and very tall . he wore two swords at his side , and was accompanied by six great dogs . he gave them a friendly greeting : " good - day , little fellows , from where do you come and to where do you go ? " the boys told him they came from a high tower , and were going out into the world to seek their fortune . the man replied : " if such be the case , i know more about your origin than any one else . and that you may have something by which to remember your father , i will give each of you a sword and three dogs . but you must promise me one thing , that you will never part from your dogs ; but take them with you wherever you go . " the boys thanked the man for his kind gifts , and promised to do as he had told them . then they bade him farewell and went their way .
