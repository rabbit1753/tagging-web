years flew by , and every morning uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea . but one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves . uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate . but he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore . then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' i am the turtle whose life you once saved . i will now pay my debt and show my gratitude . the land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there . climb on my back , and i will take you where you will . ' uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help . but scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there .
