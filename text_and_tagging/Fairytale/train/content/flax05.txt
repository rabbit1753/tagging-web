after some time the linen was taken into the house , and there cut with the scissors and torn into pieces and then pricked with needles . this certainly was not pleasant , but at last it was made into twelve garments of the kind that everybody wears . " see now , then , " said the flax , " i have become something of importance . this was my destiny . it is quite a blessing . now i shall be of some use in the world , as every one ought to be . it is the only way to be happy . i am now divided into twelve pieces , and yet the whole dozen is all one and the same . it is most extraordinary good fortune .
