the brother took his sister 's hand and said to her , " since our mother died we have had no good days ; our stepmother beats us every day , and if we go near her she kicks us away ; we have nothing to eat but hard crusts of bread left over ; the dog under the table fares better ; he gets a good piece every now and then . if our mother only knew , how she would pity us ! come , let us go together out into the wide world ! " so they went , and journeyed the whole day through fields and meadows and stony places , and if it rained the sister said , " the skies and we are weeping together . " in the evening they came to a great wood , and they were so weary with hunger and their long journey , that they climbed up into a high tree and fell asleep .
