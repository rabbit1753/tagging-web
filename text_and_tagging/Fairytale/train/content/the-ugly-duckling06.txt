" well , how goes it ? " asked an elderly duck who came to call on her . " oh , this one egg takes a dreadful long time , " said the sitting duck ; " it wo n't break . but just you look at the others ! they are the sweetest ducklings i 've ever seen ; they 're all just like their wretch of a father , who never comes to see me . " " let me look at the egg that wo n't hatch , " said the old duck ; " you may be sure that 's a turkey 's egg . i was made a fool of once that way , and i had my share of trouble and anxiety with the young ones , i can tell you , for they are afraid of the water . i could n't get them to go in ! i quacked and i pecked , but it was no good . let me see the egg . ah , yes , that 's a turkey 's egg ; you just let it lie and teach the rest to swim . " " oh , i 'll just sit on it a bit longer , " said the duck . " as i 've sat so long , i may as well give it a whitsun week ! " [ 1 ] " just as you please , " said the old duck , and walked off . at last the big egg opened . " pip ! pip ! " said the young one , scrambling out ; he was very big and ugly . the duck looked at him : " that 's a fearfully big duckling , that is , " she said . " none of the others look like that . i suppose it ca n't be a turkey poult ! well , we 'll soon see ; into the water he shall go , if i have to kick him out myself . "
