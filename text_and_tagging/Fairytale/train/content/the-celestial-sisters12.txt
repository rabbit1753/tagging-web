" she accordingly took the boy and descended . the white hawk , who was ever near the enchanted spot , heard her voice as she came down the sky . his heart beat with impatience as he saw her form and that of his son , and they were soon clasped in his arms . he heard the message of the star , and he began to hunt with the greatest activity , that he might collect the present with all dispatch . he spent whole nights , as well as days , in searching for every curious and beautiful animal and bird . he only preserved a foot , a wing , or a tail of each . when all was ready , waupee visited once more each favorite spot . the hill - top where he had been used to see the rising sun . the stream where he had sported as a boy . the old lodge , now looking sad and solemn , which he was to sit in no more . last of all , coming to the magic circle , he gazed widely around him with tearful eyes . taking his wife and child by the hand , they entered the car and were drawn up - into a country far beyond the flight of birds , or the power of mortal eye to pierce .
