" " you talk like a real stupid . that is something i could bring about the very first time i went there , " said kitta grau . " if you can do that , you shall have a splendid pair of shoes , " was the evil one 's reply . " mind you keep your word ! " said kitta , and turned toward the farm . there the woman was home alone , for her husband had gone to the forest . kitta said to the young wife : " you really have a splendid husband . "
