' i will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more . then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it . ' if you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ' your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . ' uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding . he hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess . three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home . the turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment .
