now every one came out of church , and the old lady stepped into her carriage . but just as karen was lifting up her foot to get in too , the old soldier said : " dear me , what pretty dancing shoes ! " and karen could not help it , she was obliged to dance a few steps ; and when she had once begun , her legs continued to dance . it seemed as if the shoes had got power over them . she danced round the church corner , for she could not stop ; the coachman had to run after her and seize her . he lifted her into the carriage , but her feet continued to dance , so that she kicked the good old lady violently . at last they took off her shoes , and her legs were at rest . at home the shoes were put into the cupboard , but karen could not help looking at them .
