" " yes , that is your misfortune , " said the fence - rail ; " you are so fickle , so unsettled ; you must always be travelling about into foreign lands when the cold commences here . you have no love of fatherland in you . there can be no consideration for you . " " but now , if i have been lying the whole winter in the moor , " said the swallow , " and suppose i slept the whole time , would that be taken into account ? " " bring a certificate from the old moor - hen , " said he , " that you have slept away half your time in fatherland ; then you will be treated with some consideration . "
