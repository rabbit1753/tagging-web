' ' very well , i thank you , sir , ' says i ; ' i hope you 're well ' ; wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to speak like a christian . ' what brings you here , dan ? ' says he . ' nothing at all , sir , ' says i , ' only i wish i was safe home again . ' ' is it out of the island you want to go , dan ? ' says he . ' it is , sir , ' says i ; so i up and told him how i had taken a drop too much , and fell into the water ; how i swam to the island ; and how i got into the bog and did not know my way out of it .
