once there was a king who had a pear - tree which bore four - and - twenty golden pears . every day he went into the garden and counted them to see that none were missing . but , one morning , he found that a pear had been taken during the night , and thereat he was troubled and vexed to the heart , for the pear - tree was as dear to him as the apple of his eye . now , the king had three sons , and so he called the eldest prince to him . " see , " said he , " if you will watch my pear - tree to - night , and will find me the thief who stole the pear , you shall have half of my kingdom now , and the whole of it when i am gone . " you can guess how the prince was tickled at this : oh , yes , he would watch the tree , and if the thief should come he should not get away again as easily . well , that night he sat down beside the tree , with his gun across his knees , to wait for the coming of the thief .
