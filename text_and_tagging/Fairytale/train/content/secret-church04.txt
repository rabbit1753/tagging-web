then she began to say that the schoolmaster was such a strong and able man , and finally , that she and her daughter would like to have him for priest , and whether he would not stay and succeed the old father . the schoolmaster objected that he was no scholar . but they insisted that he had more learning than was needed in their case , for they never had any visits from the bishop , nor did the dean ever hold a chapter , for of all such things they knew nothing . when the schoolmaster heard that , he said that even though he had the necessary scholarship , he doubted very much that he had the right vocation , and since this was a most important matter for him and for them , it would be unwise to act too hurriedly , so he would ask for a year to think it over . when he had said that , he found himself standing by a pond in the wood , and could see neither church nor parsonage .
