" he said to himself . at last , one day , he knew the persimmons must be quite ripe and he wanted very much to taste one . he made several attempts to climb the tree , in the vain hope of reaching one of the beautiful persimmons hanging above him ; but he failed each time , for a crab 's legs are not made for climbing trees but only for running along the ground and over stones , both of which he can do most cleverly . in his dilemma he thought of his old playmate the monkey , who , he knew , could climb trees better than any one else in the world . he determined to ask the monkey to help him , and set out to find him .
