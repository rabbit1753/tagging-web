later on li dsing and his three sons , gintscha , mutscha and notscha , aided king wu of the dschou dynasty to destroy the tyrant dschou - sin . none could withstand their might . only once did a sorcerer succeed in wounding notscha in the left arm . any other would have died of the wound . but the great one carried him into his cave , healed his wound and gave him three goblets of the wine of the gods to drink , and three fire - dates to eat . when notscha had eaten and drunk he suddenly heard a crash at his left side and another arm grew out from it . he could not speak and his eyes stood out from their sockets with horror . but it went on as it had begun : six more arms grew out of his body and two more heads , so that finally he had three heads and eight arms . he called out to his master : " what does all this mean ? " but the latter only laughed and said : " all is as it should be . thus equipped you will really be strong ! " then he taught him a magic incantation by means of which he could make his arms and heads visible or invisible as he chose . when the tyrant dschou - sin had been destroyed , li dsing and his three sons , while still on earth , were taken up into heaven and seated among the gods .
