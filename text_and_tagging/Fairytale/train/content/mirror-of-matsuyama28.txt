" then why are you always alone in your room these days ? and tell me what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve - show it to me at once . " then the daughter , though shy of confessing how she had cherished her mother 's memory , saw that she must tell her father all in order to clear herself . so she slipped the mirror out from her long sleeve and laid it before him . " this , " she said , " is what you saw me looking at just now . " " why , " he said in great surprise , " this is the mirror that i brought as a gift to your mother when i went up to the capital many years ago ! and so you have kept it all this time ? now , why do you spend so much of your time before this mirror ? " then she told him of her mother 's last words , and of how she had promised to meet her child whenever she looked into the glass . but still the father could not understand the simplicity of his daughter 's character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in reality her own face , and not that of her mother . " what do you mean ? " he asked . " i do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother by looking in this mirror ? " " it is indeed true , " said the girl : " and if you do n't believe what i say , look for yourself , " and she placed the mirror before her . there , looking back from the smooth metal disk , was her own sweet face . she pointed to the reflection seriously : " do you doubt me still ? " she asked earnestly , looking up into his face . with an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together .
