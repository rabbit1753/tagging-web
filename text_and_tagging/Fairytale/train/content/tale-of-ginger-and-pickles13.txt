" " on the contrary , they would go nowhere , " replied ginger gloomily . ( tabitha twitchit kept the only other shop in the village . she did not give credit . ) ginger and pickles gave unlimited credit . now the meaning of " credit " is this -- when a customer buys a bar of soap , instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it -- she says she will pay another time . and pickles makes a low bow and says , " with pleasure , madam , " and it is written down in a book . the customers come again and again , and buy quantities , in spite of being afraid of ginger and pickles . but there is no money in what is called the " till .
