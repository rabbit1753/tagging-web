" lay quickly , rooster of mine ! lay big silver coins , my rooster ! " but the rooster could lay no silver coins at all , and only answered " kikeriki ! kikeriki ! kikeriki ! " then the peasant fell into a rage , wandered back to the devil 's place , complained about the rooster , and told how absolutely worthless he was . he was kindly received , and the same gentleman gave him a hand - mill . when he called out " mill grind ! " to it , it would grind as much meal as he wanted it to , and would not stop until he said : " mill , stop grinding ! " and the mill would grind out every kind of meal for which he asked .
