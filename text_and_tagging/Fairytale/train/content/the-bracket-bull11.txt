" i do n't see any tree in the wood bigger or uglier than yourself , " says he , drawing the sword and whipping the head off him , so that he sent it seven furrows and seven ridges from the body . " oh , " said the head , " if i were to get going on the body again , and the men of the world would n't get me off it again . " " oh , i 'll take care of that myself , " says the boy . when he drove the cows home that night there was wonder on the people when they saw the quantity of milk they had . the gentleman said that there was another change in the caher that day again , as he did not hear but only one shout , but the lad said that he saw another one going away that day , and that it was likely that he did not come back yet . on the next day he went out , and drove the pigs and the cows up to the hall door , and was throwing down the apples to them . the third giant came out -- the eldest man of them -- and he was full mad after his two brothers being dead , and the teeth that were in his head were making a hand - stick for him . he told the boy to come down ; that he did not know what he would do to him after his having killed his two brothers . " come down , " says he , " till i draw you under my long , cold teeth " ; and it was on him the long , cold teeth were , and no lie . " go down , black thong , and bind that one till the eyes will be going out on his head with the power of the squeezing that you 'll give him . "
