the magician consented . they set out , and arriving at a good ground for their sport , they spent the day in hunting . night coming on , they built themselves a lodge of pine - branches to sleep in . although it was bitterly cold , the young man took off his leggings and moccasins , and hung them up to dry . the old magician did the same , carefully hanging his own in a separate place , and they lay down to sleep . owasso , from a glance he had given , suspected that the magician had a mind to play him a trick . to be ahead of him , he watched an opportunity to get up and change the moccasins and leggings , putting his own in the place of mishosha 's , and depending on the darkness of the lodge to help him through . near daylight , the old magician bestirred himself , as if to rekindle the fire . he slyly reached down a pair of moccasins and leggings with a stick , and thinking they were no other than those of owasso 's , he dropped them into the flames . he cast himself down , and affected to be lost in a heavy sleep . the leather leggings and moccasins soon drew up and were burned .
