a little later he met an old man , and him he asked whether he knew where the place might be that was " farther south than south , and farther north than north , and in the great hill of gold . " the man said yes , he knew well enough , but it would not do the young fellow much good to get there , for the troll who lived there killed every one . " o , i have to make the attempt , whether it lead to life or death , " said the young fellow , for he was fonder than fond of the middle one of the three maidens . so he learned the way from the old man , and finally reached the hill . there he had to pass through three rooms , before he came into the hall to the maidens . and there were locks on every door , and at each stood a watchman . " where do you want to go ? " asked the first watchman . " in to the maidens , " said the young fellow . " in you may go , but you 'll not get out again , " said the watchman , " for now the troll will be along before long . " but the young fellow said that , at any rate , he would make the attempt , and went on .
