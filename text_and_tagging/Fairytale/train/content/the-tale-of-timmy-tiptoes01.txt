once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel , called timmy tiptoes . he had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree ; and he had a little squirrel wife called goody . timmy tiptoes sat out , enjoying the breeze ; he whisked his tail and chuckled--"little wife goody , the nuts are ripe ; we must lay up a store for winter and spring . " goody tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--"the nest is so snug , we shall be sound asleep all winter . " " then we shall wake up all the thinner , when there is nothing to eat in spring - time , " replied prudent timothy .
