" that 's all very well , but we are not through yet , " said the boy , " there is worse to come , " and he told them to reef every last rag , as well as what had been left of the topsails . the second squall hit them with even greater force than the first , and was so vicious and violent that the whole crew was frightened . while it was at its worst , the boy told them to throw overboard the second cord ; and they threw it over billet by billet , and took care not to take any from the third cord . when the last billet fell , they again heard a deep groan , and then all was still . " now there will be one more squall , and that will be the worst , " said the boy , and sent every one to his station . there was not a hawser loose on the whole ship . the last squall hit them with far more force than either of the preceding ones , the ship laid over on her side so that they thought she would not right herself again , and the breaker swept over the deck .
