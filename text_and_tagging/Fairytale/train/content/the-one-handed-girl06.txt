unluckily someone else thought so too , and this was her brother 's wife , who had heard all about the pumpkin tree , and sent her slave with a handful of grain to buy her a pumpkin . at first the girl told him that so few were left that she could not spare any ; but when she found that he belonged to her brother , she changed her mind , and went out to the tree and gathered the largest and the ripest that was there . ' take this one , ' she said to the slave , ' and carry it back to your mistress , but tell her to keep the corn , as the pumpkin is a gift . ' the brother 's wife was overjoyed at the sight of the fruit , and when she tasted it , she declared it was the nicest she had ever eaten . indeed , all night she thought of nothing else , and early in the morning she called another slave ( for she was a rich woman ) and bade him go and ask for another pumpkin . but the girl , who had just been out to look at her tree , told him that they were all eaten , so he went back empty - handed to his mistress .
