he replied , " my father brought it . " the magician began to feel uneasy , for he found that he had been outwitted . he , however , put on a grave face , and entering the lodge , acted as if nothing unusual had happened . some days after this , mishosha again requested his son - in - law to accompany him . owasso , without hesitation , said " yes ! " they went out , and , in a rapid passage , they arrived at a solitary island , which was no more than a heap of high and craggy rocks . the magician said to owasso , " go on shore , my son , and pick up all the gulls ' eggs you can find . " the rocks were strewn with eggs , and the air resounded with the cry of the birds as they saw them gathered up by owasso . the old magician took the opportunity to speak to the gulls . " i have long wished , " he said , " to offer you something . i now give you this young man for food . " he then uttered the charm to his canoe , and it shot out of sight , leaving owasso to make his peace the best way he could . the gulls flew in immense numbers around him , and were ready to devour him . owasso did not lose his presence of mind , but he addressed them and said : " gulls , you know you were not formed to eat human flesh , nor was man made to be the prey of birds . obey my words . fly close together , a sufficient number of you , and carry me on your backs to the magician 's lodge . " they listened attentively to what he said , and seeing nothing unreasonable in his request , they obeyed him . owasso soon found himself sailing through the air swiftly homeward . meanwhile , it appears that the old magician had fallen asleep and allowed his canoe to come to a stand - still . owasso , in his flight over the lake , saw him lying on his back in the boat , taking a nap , which was quite natural , as the day was very soft and balmy .
