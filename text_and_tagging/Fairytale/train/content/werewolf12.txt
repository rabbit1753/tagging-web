the princess spoke to her in her usual friendly way : " good evening , motherkin . may i ask you for a drink of water ? " " you are heartily welcome to it , " said the old woman . " who may you be , that step beneath my lowly roof and greet me in so winning a way ? " the king 's daughter told her who she was , and that she had gone out to relieve her heart , in order to forget her great grief . " and what may your great grief be ? " asked the old woman . " no doubt it is my fate to grieve , " said the princess , " and i can never be happy again . i have lost my only love , and god alone knows whether i shall ever see him again . " and she also told her why it was , and the tears ran down her cheeks in streams , so that any one would have felt sorry for her . when she had ended the old woman said : " you did well in confiding your sorrow to me . i have lived long and may be able to give you a bit of good advice . when you leave here you will see a lily growing from the ground . this lily is not like other lilies , however , but has many strange virtues . run quickly over to it , and pick it . if you can do that then you need not worry , for then one will appear who will tell you what to do . " then they parted and the king 's daughter thanked her and went her way ; while the old woman sat on the bench and wagged her head . but the queen 's daughter had been standing without the hut the entire time , vexing herself , and grumbling because the king 's daughter had taken so long .
