" and he requested maidwa to take a seat by his daughter , and the two women did the same . after suitable refreshment for all , and while maidwa smoked a pipe , the chief asked him to relate his adventures in the hearing of all the inmates of the lodge , and of the strangers who had gathered in at report of his singular fortunes . maidwa gave them his whole story . when he came to those parts which related to the red swan , they turned and looked upon her in wonder and admiration , for she was very beautiful . the chief then informed maidwa that his brothers had been to their town in search of him , but that they had gone back some time before , having given up all hopes of ever seeing him again . he added , that since he had shown himself a man of spirit , whom fortune was pleased to befriend , he should take his daughter with him .
