peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow , and started running as fast as he could go , along a straight walk behind some black - currant bushes . mr . mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner , but peter did not care . he slipped underneath the gate , and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden . mr . mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare - crow to frighten the blackbirds . peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir - tree . he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit - hole , and shut his eyes . his mother was busy cooking ; she wondered what he had done with his clothes . it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight !
