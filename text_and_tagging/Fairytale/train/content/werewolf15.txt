for a long time she did not tire of looking at the beautiful flower . then she suddenly began to wonder what her step - mother would say when she came home after having remained out so long . and she looked around , in order to find the way back to the castle . but as she looked around , behold , the sun had set and no more than a little strip of daylight rested on the summit of the hill . below her lay the forest , so dark and shadowed that she had no faith in her ability to find the homeward path . and now she grew very sad , for she could think of nothing better to do than to spend the night on the hill - top . she seated herself on the rock , put her hand to her cheek , cried , and thought of her unkind step - mother and step - sisters , and of all the harsh words she would have to endure when she returned . and she thought of her father , the king , who was away at war , and of the love of her heart , whom she would never see again . she grieved so bitterly that she did not even know she wept . night came and darkness , and the stars rose , and still the princess sat in the same spot and wept . and while she sat there , lost in her thoughts , she heard a voice say : " good evening , lovely maiden ! why do you sit here so sad and lonely ? " she stood up hastily , and felt much embarrassed , which was not surprising . when she looked around there was nothing to be seen but a tiny old man , who nodded to her and seemed to be very humble .
