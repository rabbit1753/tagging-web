her elder sisters were all sought in marriage , and one after the other they went off to dwell in the lodges of their husbands ; but oweenee was deaf to all proposals of the kind . at last she married an old man called osseo , who was scarcely able to walk , and who was too poor to have things like others . the only property he owned in the world was the walking - staff which he carried in his hand . though thus poor and homely , osseo was a devout and good man ; faithful in all his duties , and obedient in all things to the good spirit . of course they jeered and laughed at oweenee on all sides , but she seemed to be quite happy , and said to them , " it is my choice and you will see in the end who has acted the wisest . " they made a special mock of the walking - staff , and scarcely an hour in the day passed that they had not some disparaging reference to it . among themselves they spoke of osseo of the walking - staff , in derision , as the owner of the big woods , or the great timber - man . " true , " said oweenee , " it is but a simple stick ; but as it supports the steps of my husband , it is more precious to me than all the forests of the north . " a time came when the sisters , and their husbands , and their parents were all invited to a feast . as the distance was considerable , they doubted whether osseo , so aged and feeble , would be able to undertake the journey ; but in spite of their friendly doubts , he joined them , and set out with a good heart .
