" and who wants to make a pretty wench like thee into a nun ? more likely that some gallant gentleman should want to make a bride of thee . " " oh , no , " answered maisie , " my mother says no gentleman would look at me because i can not spin . " " nonsense , " said the tiny woman . " spinning is all very well for old folks like me -- my lips , as thou seest , are long and ugly because i have spun so much , for i always wet my fingers with them , the easier to draw the thread from the distaff . no , no , take care of thy beauty , child ; do not waste it over the spinning - wheel , nor yet in a nunnery . " " if my mother only thought as thou dost , " replied the girl sadly ; and , encouraged by the old woman 's kindly face , she told her the whole story . " well , " said the old dame , " i do not like to see pretty girls weep ; what if i were able to help thee , and spin the lint for thee ? " maisie thought that this offer was too good to be true ; but her new friend bade her run home and fetch the lint ; and i need not tell you that she required no second bidding . when she returned she handed the bundle to the little lady , and was about to ask her where she should meet her in order to get the thread from her when it was spun , when a sudden noise behind her made her look round . she saw nothing ; but what was her horror and surprise when she turned back again , to find that the old woman had vanished entirely , lint and all .
