now in this lake there happened to harbor a wicked old manito , mishosha by name , who looked at the brothers as they played . he was vastly pleased with their nimbleness and beauty . he thought to himself , what shall i do to get these lads to accompany me ? one of them shall hit the ball sideways , and it shall fall into my canoe . it so happened , and it somehow seemed as if owasso , the elder brother , had purposely given it that direction . when owasso saw the old man , he professed to be greatly surprised . as was the other , sheem by name , in truth , for he had not noticed the old manito before . " bring the ball to us , " they both cried out . " come to the shore . " " no , " answered the old magician . he , however , came near enough for either of them to wade out to him . " come , come , " he said . " come and get your ball . " they insisted that he should come ashore , but he sturdily declined to oblige them . " very well , " said owasso , " i will go and get it . " and he ran into the water . " hand it to me , " he said , when he had approached near enough to receive it . " ha ! " answered the manito , " reach over and get it yourself . " owasso was about to grasp the ball , when the old magician suddenly seized him and pushed him into the boat . " my grandfather , " said owasso , " pray take my little brother also . alone i can not go with you . he will starve if i leave him . " mishosha only laughed at him . then uttering the charmed words , " chemaun poll ! " and giving his canoe a slap , it glided through the water , without further help , with the swiftness of an arrow . in a short time they reached the magician 's lodge , which stood upon the further shore , a little distance back from the lake . the two daughters of mishosha were seated within . " my daughter , " he said to his eldest , as they entered the lodge , " i have brought you a husband . "
