this transformation rather frightened jegu , but the brownie bade him have no fears , for he would not do him any harm ; indeed , he hoped that jegu might find him of some use . ' but why should you take all this interest in me ? ' asked the peasant suspiciously . ' because of a service you did me last winter , which i have never forgotten , ' answered the little fellow . ' you know , i am sure , that the korigans who dwell in the white corn country have declared war on my people , because they say that they are the friends of man . we were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands , and to hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes . since that time , partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves , we have continued to transform ourselves , and it was in this way that i got to know you . ' ' how ? ' exclaimed jegu , filled with astonishment . ' do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river , three months ago , you found a robin redbreast caught in a net ? ' ' yes , ' answered jegu , ' i remember it very well , and i opened the net and let him go . ' ' well , i was that robin redbreast , and ever since i have vowed to be your friend , and as you want to marry barbaik , i will prove the truth of what i say by helping you to do so . ' ' ah ! my little brownie , if you can do that , there is nothing i wo n't give you , except my soul . ' ' then let me alone , ' rejoined the dwarf , ' and i promise you that in a very few months you shall be master of the farm and of barbaik . ' ' but how are you going to do it ? ' exclaimed jegu wonderingly . ' that is my affair . perhaps i may tell you later . meanwhile you just eat and sleep , and do n't worry yourself about anything . '
