and then , one sunday , the white bear actually came and told her that now she might make the trip to her parents . so she seated herself on the bear 's back , and the bear set out . after they had gone a very long distance , they at length came to a fine , large , white house , before which her brothers and sisters were running about and playing . all was so rich and splendid that it was a real pleasure merely to look at it .
