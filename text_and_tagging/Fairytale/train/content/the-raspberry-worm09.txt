lisa picked , aina picked . lisa ate , aina ate , and in a little while their baskets were full . ' now we shall go home , ' said aina . ' no , let us gather a few more , ' said lisa . so they put the baskets down on the ground and began to fill their pinafores , and it was not long before their pinafores were full , too . ' now we shall go home , ' said lina . ' yes , now we shall go home , ' said aina . both girls took a basket in one hand and held up her apron in the other and then turned to go home . but that was easier said than done . they had never been so far in the great wood before , they could not find any road nor path , and soon the girls noticed that they had lost their way . the worst of it was that the shadows of the tress were becoming so long in the evening sunlight , the birds were beginning to fly home , and the day was closing in . at last the sun went down behind the pine tops , and it was cool and dusky in the great wood . the girls became anxious but went steadily on , expecting that the wood would soon end , and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of their home . after they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark . at last they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes , and when they looked around them , they saw , as much as they could in the darkness , that they were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they had picked their baskets and their aprons full . then they were so tired that they sat down on a stone and began to cry .
