now there was a little garden round the enchanted house , in which grew twelve tall lilies . the girl , wishing to please her brothers , plucked the twelve flowers , meaning to present one to each of them as they sat at supper . but hardly had she plucked the flowers when her brothers were turned into twelve ravens , who flew croaking over the wood , and the house and garden vanished also . so the poor girl found herself left all alone in the wood , and as she looked round her she noticed an old woman standing close beside her , who said : ' my child , what have you done ? why did n't you leave the flowers alone ? they were your twelve brothers . now they are changed for ever into ravens . ' the girl asked , sobbing : ' is there no means of setting them free ? ' ' no , ' said the old woman , ' there is only one way in the whole world , and that is so difficult that you wo n't free them by it , for you would have to be dumb and not laugh for seven years , and if you spoke a single word , though but an hour were wanting to the time , your silence would all have been in vain , and that one word would slay your brothers . ' then the girl said to herself : ' if that is all i am quite sure i can free my brothers . ' so she searched for a high tree , and when she had found one she climbed up it and spun all day long , never laughing or speaking one word .
