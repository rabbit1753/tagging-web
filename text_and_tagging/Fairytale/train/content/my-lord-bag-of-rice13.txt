hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony , and the warrior saw on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer . the dragon king stood by the warrior 's side trembling with fear . " the centipede ! the centipede ! those two balls of fire are its eyes . it is coming for its prey ! now is the time to kill it . " hidesato looked where his host pointed , and , in the dim light of the starlit evening , behind the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains , and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards the shore . hidesato showed not the least sign of fear . he tried to calm the dragon king . " do n't be afraid . i shall surely kill the centipede . just bring me my bow and arrows . "
