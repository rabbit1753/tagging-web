" oh , yes ! that is easily enough done , " said boots , and without more ado he took off his tattered cap and blew into it . then he put it on his head again and bawled out , " break pots ! break pots ! " no sooner had he spoken these words than the old woman jumped up and began breaking and smashing her pots and crocks as though she had gone crazy . that was what boots had paid her five shillings for doing , but of it the king knew nothing . " hui ! " said he to himself , " i must buy that hat from the fellow or he will fool the princess away from me for sure and certain . " then he began talking to boots as sweetly as though he had honey in his mouth . perhaps boots would sell the hat to him ? oh , no ! boots could not think of such a thing as selling his fooling cap . come , come ; the king wanted that hat , and sooner than miss buying it he would give a whole bag of gold money for it .
