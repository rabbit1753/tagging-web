after the wild man had talked to the boy in this way , he finally did as he said , went up to his mother , begged her to comb his hair , and took the key from her girdle . then he ran down to the cage and opened the door . and when they parted , the dwarf said : " here is your apple of gold , that i promised to give back to you , and i thank you for setting me free . and another time when you have need of me , i will help you in turn . " and with that he ran off on his own way . but the prince went back to his mother , and returned the key in the same way he had taken it .
