' wait a little , ' said the dream - boy . and now little lasse saw that the kitchen door was open , and from within there was heard a low , pleasant frizzling , like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a wooden ladle into a hot frying - pan . ' perhaps we should sail back to polynesia now ? ' said the happy dream - boy . ' no ; they are frying pancakes in europe just now , ' said little lasse ; and he wanted to jump ashore , but he could not . the dream - boy had tied him with a chain of flowers , so that he could not move . and now all the little dreams came about him , thousands and thousands of little children , and they made a ring around him and sang a little song : the world is very , very wide , little lasse , lasse , and though you 've sailed beyond the tide , you can never tell how wide it is on the other side , lasse , little lasse . you have found it cold and hot , little lasse , lasse ; but in no land is god not , lasse , little lasse . many men live there as here , but they all to god are dear , little lasse , lasse . when his angel is your guide , little lasse , lasse , then no harm can e'er betide , even on the other side where the wild beasts wander . but tell us now , whene'er you roam , do you not find the best is home of all the lands you 've looked upon , lasse , little lasse ?
