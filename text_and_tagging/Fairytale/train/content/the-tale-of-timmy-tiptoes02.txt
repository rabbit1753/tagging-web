when timmy and goody tiptoes came to the nut thicket , they found other squirrels were there already . timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig ; they worked away quietly by themselves . every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts . they carried them away in bags , and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest . when these stumps were full , they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree , that had belonged to a wood - pecker ; the nuts rattled down -- down -- down inside . " how shall you ever get them out again ? it is like a money - box ! " said goody . " i shall be much thinner before spring - time , my love , " said timmy tiptoes , peeping into the hole .
