the little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them . their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows , an old blacking - brush and two decayed turnips . then they all hid under a bush and watched for mr . mcgregor . mr . mcgregor came back and picked up the sack , and carried it off . he carried it hanging down , as if it were rather heavy . the flopsy bunnies followed at a safe distance . they watched him go into his house . and then they crept up to the window to listen .
