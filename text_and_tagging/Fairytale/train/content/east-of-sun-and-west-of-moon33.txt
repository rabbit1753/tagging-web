that day the maiden again sat beneath the windows of the castle , and wound her golden reel . and all went as on the preceding day . the princess asked what she wanted for the reel , and the maiden answered that she would sell it neither for gold nor for money . if she might speak that night to the prince , then she would give the reel to the princess . yet when the maiden came to the prince , he was again fast asleep , and no matter how much she wept and wailed , and cried and shook , she could not wake him . but as soon as day dawned , and it grew bright , the princess with the long nose came and drove her out . and that day the maiden again seated herself beneath the windows of the castle , and spun with her golden spindle . of course , the princess with the long nose wanted to have that , too . she opened the window , and asked what she wanted for the golden spindle . the maiden replied , as she had twice before , that she would sell the spindle neither for gold nor money . the princess could have it if she might speak to the prince again that night . yes , that she was welcome to do , said the princess , and took the golden spindle . now it happened that some christians , who were captives in the castle , and quartered in a room beside that of the prince , had heard a woman weeping and wailing pitifully in the prince 's room for the past two nights . so they told the prince . and that evening when the princess came to him with his night - cap , the prince pretended to drink it . he instead poured it out behind his back , for he could well imagine that she had put a sleeping - powder into the cup . then , when the maiden came in , the prince was awake , and she had to tell him just how she had found the castle .
