as he sat up in his tree he played away on his pipes and drew the loveliest music from them . as he was playing one day a king , who had lost his way , happened to pass close by , and hearing the music he was much surprised , and sent one of his servants to find out where it came from . the man peered about , but he could see nothing but a little creature which looked like a cock with a hedgehog sitting on it , perched up in a tree . the king desired the servant to ask the strange creature why it sat there , and if it knew the shortest way to his kingdom . on this jack my hedgehog stepped down from his tree and said he would undertake to show the king his way home if the king on his part would give him his written promise to let him have whatever first met him on his return . the king thought to himself , ' that 's easy enough to promise . the creature wo n't understand a word about it , so i can just write what i choose . ' meantime jack minded his asses and pigs , sat aloft in his tree , played his bagpipes , and was always merry and cheery . after a time it so happened that another king , having lost his way , passed by with his servants and escort , wondering how he could find his way home , for the forest was very vast . he too heard the music , and told one of his men to find out whence it came . the man came under the tree , and looking up to the top there he saw jack my hedgehog astride on the cock . the servant asked jack what he was doing up there . ' i 'm minding my pigs and donkeys ; but what do you want ? ' was the reply . then the servant told him they had lost their way , and wanted some one to show it them . down came jack my hedgehog with his cock , and told the old king he would show him the right way if he would solemnly promise to give him the first thing he met in front of his royal castle . the king said ' yes , ' and gave jack a written promise to that effect .
