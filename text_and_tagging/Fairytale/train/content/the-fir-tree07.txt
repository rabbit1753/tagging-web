then came two footmen in livery and carried the fir - tree to a large and beautiful room . there were pictures hanging on the walls , and near the dutch stove stood great chinese vases with lions on their lids ; there were armchairs , silk - covered sofas , big tables laden with picture - books and toys , worth hundreds of pounds - at least , so the children said . the fir - tree was placed in a great tub filled with sand , but no one could see that it was a tub , for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet . how the tree trembled ! what was coming now ? on its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper , each full of sugarplums ; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing , over a hundred red , blue , and white tapers were fastened among the branches . dolls as life - like as human beings - the fir - tree had never seen any before were suspended among the green , and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star ; it was gorgeous , quite unusually gorgeous !
