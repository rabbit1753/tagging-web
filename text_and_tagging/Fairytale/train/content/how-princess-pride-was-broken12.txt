so off the poor princess went to the great town , and stood in the corner of the market with her eggs . by and by there came along a tipsy countryman - tramp ! tramp ! tramp ! as for the basket of eggs , he minded them no more than so many green apples . smash ! and there they lay on the ground , and were fit for nothing but to patch broken promises , as we say in our town . then how the poor princess did wring her hands and cry and cry , for she was afraid to go home to her husband , because of the hard words he would be sure to fling at her . all the same , there was no other place for her to go ; so back she went .
