at the spring of day , the next morning , the father , delighted at having gained his end , prepared a repast for his son , and hastened to set it before him . on coming to the door of the little lodge , he was surprised to hear his son talking to himself . he stooped his ear to listen , and , looking through a small opening , he was yet more astonished when he beheld his son painted with vermilion over all his breast , and in the act of finishing his work by laying on the paint as far back on his shoulders as he could reach with his hands , saying at the same time , to himself : " my father has destroyed my fortune as a man . he would not listen to my requests . he has urged me beyond my tender strength . he will be the loser . i shall be forever happy in my new state , for i have been obedient to my parent . he alone will be the sufferer , for my guardian spirit is a just one . though not propitious to me in the manner i desired , he has shown me pity in another way -- he has given me another shape ; and now i must go . " " regret not , my father , the change you behold . i shall be happier in my present state than i could have been as a man . i shall always be the friend of men , and keep near their dwellings . i shall ever be happy and contented ; and although i could not gratify your wishes as a warrior , it will be my daily aim to make you amends for it as a harbinger of peace and joy . i will cheer you by my songs , and strive to inspire in others the joy and lightsomeness of heart i feel in my present state . this will be some compensation to you for the loss of glory you expected . i am now free from the cares and pains of human life . my food is spontaneously furnished by the mountains and fields , and my pathway of life is in the bright air . " then stretching himself on his toes , as if delighted with the gift of wings , iadilla caroled one of his sweetest songs , and flew away into a neighboring wood .
