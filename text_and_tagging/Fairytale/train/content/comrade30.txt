" here is the thing of which the princess was thinking , " said he . then everything was in apple - pie order , and when the youth was invited to the king 's table and they had eaten , the princess grew as merry as a lark . " have you , perhaps , the thing of which i was thinking ? " " to be sure , " said the youth , and he drew forth the head from beneath his coat , and flung it on the table so that the table and all that was on it fell over . the princess looked as though she had come from the grave . yet she could not deny that this was the thing of which she had thought , and now she had to take the youth , as she had promised . so the wedding was celebrated , and there was great joy throughout the kingdom .
