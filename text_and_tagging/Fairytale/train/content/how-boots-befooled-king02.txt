now , there was a man who was well off in the world , and who had three sons ; the first was named peter , and the second was named paul . peter and paul thought themselves as wise as anybody in all of the world , and their father thought as they did . as for the youngest son , he was named boots . nobody thought anything of him except that he was silly , for he did nothing but sit poking in the warm ashes all of the day . one morning peter spoke up and said that he was going to the town to have a try at befooling the king , for it would be a fine thing to have a princess in the family . his father did not say no , for if anybody was wise enough to befool the king , peter was the lad . so , after peter had eaten a good breakfast , off he set for the town , right foot foremost . after a while he came to the king 's house and - rap ! tap ! tap!-he knocked at the door . well ; what did he want ?
