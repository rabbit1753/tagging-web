but the comrade took the youth aside , and said that on their wedding - night he might close his eyes and pretend to sleep . if he loved his life , and followed his advice , he would not sleep a wink until the princess was freed from her troll - skin . he must whip it off with nine new switches of birch - wood , and strip it off with three milk - baths beside . first he must scrub it off in a tub of year - old whey , then he must rub it off in a tub of sour milk , and finally , he must sponge it off in a tub of sweet milk . he had laid the birch switches beneath the bed , and had stood the tubs of milk in the corner ; all was prepared . the youth promised to follow his advice , and do as he had told him . when night came , and he lay in his bed , the princess raised herself on her elbows , to see if he were really asleep , and she tickled him under the nose ; but he was sleeping quite soundly . then she pulled his hair and his beard . but it seemed to her that he slept like a log . then she drew a great butcher 's knife out from beneath her pillow , and wanted to cut off his head . but the youth leaped up , struck the knife from her hand , seized her by the hair , whipped her with the switches , and did not stop until not one was left . thereupon he threw her into the tub of whey , and then he saw what sort of creature she really was , for her whole body was coal - black . but when he had scrubbed her in the whey , and rubbed her in the sour milk , and sponged her in the sweet milk , the troll - skin had altogether disappeared , and she was lovelier than she had ever been before .
