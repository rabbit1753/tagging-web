" i should really have voted for myself , " said the mule , " if i had not been one of the judges on the committee . not only the rapidity with which advance is made , but every other quality should have due consideration ; as , for instance , how much weight a candidate is able to draw ; but i have not brought this quality forward now , nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight , nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles , to lead people on a false track , thinking he has concealed himself . no ; there is something else on which more stress should be laid , and which ought not be left unnoticed . i mean that which mankind call the beautiful . it is on the beautiful that i particularly fix my eyes . i observed the well - grown ears of the hare ; it is a pleasure to me to observe how long they are . it seemed as if i saw myself again in the days of my childhood ; and so i voted for the hare .
