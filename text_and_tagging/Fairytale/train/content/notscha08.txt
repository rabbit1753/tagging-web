but notscha said : " tell me who you are before we fight . " " i am the son of the dragon - king , " was the reply . " and i am notscha , the son of general li dsing . you must not rouse my anger with your violence , or i will skin you , together with that old mud - fish , your father ! " then the dragon grew wild with rage , and came storming along furiously . but notscha cast his crimson cloth into the air , so that it flashed like a ball of fire , and cast the dragon - youth from his breast . then notscha took his golden armlet and struck him on the forehead with it , so that he had to reveal himself in his true form as a golden dragon , and fall down dead .
