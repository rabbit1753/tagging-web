but amid all the leafy haunts , none drew her steps toward it so often as a forest of pines , on the open shore , called manitowok , or the sacred wood . it was one of those hallowed places which is the resort of the little wild men of the woods , and of the turtle spirits or fairies which delight in romantic scenes . owing to this circumstance , its green retirement was seldom visited by indians , who feared to fall under the influence of its mischievous inhabitants . and whenever they were compelled by stress of weather to make a landing on this part of the coast , they never failed to leave an offering of tobacco , or some other token , to show that they desired to stand well with the proprietors of the fairy ground . to this sacred spot leelinau had made her way at an early age , gathering strange flowers and plants , which she would bring home to her parents , and relate to them all the haps and mishaps that had occurred in her rambles . although they discountenanced her frequent visits to the place , they were not able to restrain them , for she was of so gentle and delicate a temper that they feared to thwart her . her attachment to the fairy wood , therefore , grew with her years . if she wished to solicit her spirits to procure pleasant dreams , or any other maiden favor , leelinau repaired to the manitowok . if her father remained abroad in the hunt later than usual , and it was feared that he had been overwhelmed by the tempest , or had met with some other mischance , leelinau offered up her prayers for safety at the manitowok . it was there that she fasted , mused , and strolled .
