as for the gooseherd he just tied the kerchief around his arm so that everybody might see it ; and all the folks said , " hi ! that is the princess 's kerchief . " the next day , when he drove his flock of geese up on the hill , he took a silver looking - glass and a golden comb out of his pocket and began to comb his hair , and you should have seen how the one and the other glistened in the sun . it took the princess no longer to see the comb and the looking - glass than it had the golden ball , and then she must and would have them . so she sent one to find whether the lad was of a mind to sell them , for she thought that she had never seen anything so pretty in all of her life before . " yes , " said he , " i will sell them , but the princess must come up on the hill back of the hedge and give me the necklace she wears about her neck . "
