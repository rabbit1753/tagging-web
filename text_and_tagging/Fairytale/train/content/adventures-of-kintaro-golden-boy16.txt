" he hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them . kintaro knew nothing of all this , and little guessed that he was being followed . on reaching the other side of the river he and the animals separated , they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother , who was waiting for him . " oh , mother , " said kintaro , " do n't you know that i am the strongest ? there was no need for me to wrestle with any of them . " " but next to you then , who is the strongest ? " " the bear comes next to me in strength , " answered kintaro . " and after the bear ? " asked his mother again . " next to the bear it is not easy to say which is the strongest , for the deer , the monkey , and the hare all seem to be as strong as each other , " said kintaro . suddenly kintaro and his mother were startled by a voice from outside . " listen to me , little boy ! next time you go , take this old man with you to the wrestling match . he would like to join the sport too ! "
