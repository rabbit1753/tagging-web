suddenly he heard a hideous cry from the stern of the boat , and felt certain that it was the drang , who was singing his death - song . then he prayed god to guard his wife and children , for he thought his last hour had come . as he sat there and prayed , he made out something black . when his boat drew nearer , he noticed that it was only three cormorants , sitting on a piece of drift - wood and -- swish ! he had passed them . thus he sailed for a long time , and grew so hungry , so thirsty and so weary that he did not know what to do . the most part he sat with the rudder in his hand and slept . but all of a sudden the boat ran up on a beach and stopped . then isaac opened his eyes . the sun broke through the fog , and shone on a beautiful land . its hills and mountains were green to their very tops , fields and meadows lay among their slopes . he seemed to breathe a fragrance of flowers and grass sweeter than any he had ever known before .
