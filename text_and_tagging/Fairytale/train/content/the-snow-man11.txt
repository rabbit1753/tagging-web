' why did you leave her ? ' asked the snow - man . he had a feeling that such a being must be a lady . ' how could you leave such a place ? ' ' i had to ! ' said the yard - dog . ' they turned me out of doors , and chained me up here . i had bitten the youngest boy in the leg , because he took away the bone i was gnawing ; a bone for a bone , i thought ! but they were very angry , and from that time i have been chained here , and i have lost my voice . do n't you hear how hoarse i am ? bow - wow ! i ca n't speak like other dogs . bow - wow ! that was the end of happiness ! ' the snow - man , however , was not listening to him any more ; he was looking into the room where the housekeeper lived , where the stove stood on its four iron legs , and seemed to be just the same size as the snow - man . ' how something is cracking inside me ! ' he said . ' shall i never be able to get in there ? it is certainly a very innocent wish , and our innocent wishes ought to be fulfilled . i must get there , and lean against the stove , if i have to break the window first ! ' ' you will never get inside there ! ' said the yard - dog ; ' and if you were to reach the stove you would disappear . bow - wow ! ' ' i 'm as good as gone already ! ' answered the snow - man . ' i believe i 'm breaking up ! '
