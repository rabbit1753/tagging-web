once upon a time there was little girl , pretty and dainty . but in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was poor , and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes , so that her little instep grew quite red . in the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker 's wife ; she sat down and made , as well as she could , a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth . they were clumsy , but she meant well , for they were intended for the little girl , whose name was karen . karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on the day of her mother 's funeral . they were certainly not suitable for mourning ; but she had no others , and so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin . just then a large old carriage came by , and in it sat an old lady ; she looked at the little girl , and taking pity on her , said to the clergyman , " look here , if you will give me the little girl , i will take care of her .
