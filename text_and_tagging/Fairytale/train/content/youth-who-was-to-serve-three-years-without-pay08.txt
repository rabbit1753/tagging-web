they marched along as fast as they could , but still it was farther away than it seemed . so it was late at night before they reached their goal . the prince knocked . " who is knocking at my door , and disturbing my sleep ? " came a voice within the hill . and the voice was so powerful that the earth trembled . " open , father , your son has come home ! " cried the prince . then the father was glad to open the door quickly . " i thought you were already lying at the bottom of the sea , " said the old man . " but you are not alone ? " " this is the chap who delivered me , " said the prince , " and i asked him to come with me so that you could reward him . " that he would attend to , said the old man . " now you must come right in , " said he , " for here you may rest in safety . " they went in and sat down , and the old man laid an armful of wood and a couple of big logs on the fire , until every corner was as bright as day , and wherever they looked everything was indescribably splendid . the youth had never seen anything like it , and such fine things to eat and drink as the old man served up to him , he had never yet tasted . and the bowls and dishes , and goblets and plates , were all of pure silver and shining gold .
