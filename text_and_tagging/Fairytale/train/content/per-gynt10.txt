per gynt once more lit the fire , called his dogs and locked the herdsman 's hut . he went on north , toward the hut at val , in which there were three dairy - maids . after he had covered some distance he saw a fire , as though the whole hut were ablaze . at the same moment he came across a whole pack of wolves , of whom he shot some and clubbed the others to death . when he reached the hut at val , he found it pitch dark there , and there was no fire to be seen , far or near . but there were four strangers in the hut , who were frightening the dairy - maids . they were four mountain trolls , and their names were : gust i vore , tron valfjeldet , kjostol aabakken , and rolf eldforkungen . gust i vore stood at the door , on guard , and per gynt shot at him , but missed , so he ran away . when per gynt entered the room the dairy - maids were well - nigh frightened to death ; but when the trolls saw who had come they began to wail , and told eldforkungen to make a fire . at the same moment the dogs sprang upon kjostol aabakken , and threw him head over heels into the hearth , so that the ashes and sparks flew about .
