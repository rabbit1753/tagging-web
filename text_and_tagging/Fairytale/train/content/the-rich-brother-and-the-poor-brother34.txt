' this is the wretch who killed our father , ' they said , ' and we demand that he should die also . ' ' how did you kill him ? ' asked the judge , turning to the accused , and the poor man told how he had leaped from the wall , not knowing that anyone was beneath . ' well , this is my judgment , ' replied the judge , when they had all spoken : ' let the accused sit under the wall , and let the sons of the dead man jump from the top and fall on him and kill him , and if they will not to this , then they are condemned to pay eight hundred pounds for their false accusation . ' the young men looked at each other , and slowly shook their heads . ' we will pay the fine , ' said they , and the judge nodded . so the poor man rode the mule home , and brought back to his family enough money to keep them in comfort to the end of their days .
