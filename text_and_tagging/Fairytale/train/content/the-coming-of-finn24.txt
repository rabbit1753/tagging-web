finn caught the fire - ball in the magic mantle . the enchanter blew a second and a third , and finn caught them both . the man saw that his power over tara was at an end , and that his magic arts had been defeated . on the third occasion he saw finn 's face , and recognised his conqueror . he turned to flee , and though slow was his coming , swifter than the wind was his going , that he might recover the protection of his enchanted palace before the " fair - faced youth clad in skins " should overtake him . finn let fall the mantle as he had been instructed , and pursued him , but in vain . soon he perceived that he could not possibly overtake the swift enchanter . then he was aware that the magic spear struggled in his hand like a hound in a leash . " go , then , if thou wilt , " he said , and , poising , cast the spear from him . it shot through the dark night hissing and screaming . there was a track of fire behind it . finn followed , and on the threshold of the enchanted palace he found the body of midna . he was quite dead , with the blood pouring through a wound in the middle of his back ; but the spear was gone . finn drew his sword and cut off the enchanter 's head , and returned with it to tara . when he came to the spot where he had dropped the mantle it was not seen , but smoke and flame issued there from a hole in the ground . that hole was twenty feet deep in the earth , and at the bottom of it there was a fire always from that night , and it was never extinguished . it was called the fire of the son of midna . it was in a depression on the north side of the hill of tara , called the glen of the mantle , glen - a - brat .
