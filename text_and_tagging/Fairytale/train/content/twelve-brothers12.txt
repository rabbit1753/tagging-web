when they had lived a few years happily together , the king 's mother , who was a wicked old woman , began to slander the young queen , and said to the king : ' she is only a low - born beggar maid that you have married ; who knows what mischief she is up to ? if she is deaf and ca n't speak , she might at least laugh ; depend upon it , those who do n't laugh have a bad conscience . ' at first the king paid no heed to her words , but the old woman harped so long on the subject , and accused the young queen of so many bad things , that at last he let himself be talked over , and condemned his beautiful wife to death .
