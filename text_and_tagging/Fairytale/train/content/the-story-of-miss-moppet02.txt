the mouse thinks she is looking very ill . he comes sliding down the bell - pull . miss moppet looks worse and worse . the mouse comes a little nearer . miss moppet holds her poor head in her paws , and looks at him through a hole in the duster . the mouse comes very close . and then all of a sudden -- miss moppet jumps upon the mouse ! and because the mouse has teased miss moppet -- miss moppet thinks she will tease the mouse ; which is not at all nice of miss moppet . she ties him up in the duster , and tosses it about like a ball . but she forgot about that hole in the duster ; and when she untied it -- there was no mouse ! he has wriggled out and run away ; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard !
