now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch , asking for admittance . when the servant went to the door to see who it was , there was only an old woman , very respectable in appearance . on being asked who she was and what was her business , the old woman replied with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby . if the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him .
