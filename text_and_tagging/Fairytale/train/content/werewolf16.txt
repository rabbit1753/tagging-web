she answered : " yes , it is no doubt my fate to grieve , and never be happy again . i have lost my dearest love , and now i have lost my way in the forest , and am afraid of being devoured by wild beasts . " " as to that , " said the old man , " you need have no fear . if you will do exactly as i say , i will help you . " this made the princess happy ; for she felt that all the rest of the world had abandoned her . then the old man drew out flint and steel and said : " lovely maiden , you must first build a fire . " she did as he told her , gathered moss , brush and dry sticks , struck sparks and lit such a fire on the hill - top that the flame blazed up to the skies . that done the old man said : " go on a bit and you will find a kettle of tar , and bring the kettle to me . " this the king 's daughter did . the old man continued : " now put the kettle on the fire . " and the princess did that as well . when the tar began to boil , the old man said : " now throw your white lily into the kettle . " the princess thought this a harsh command , and earnestly begged to be allowed to keep the lily . but the old man said : " did you not promise to obey my every command ? do as i tell you or you will regret it . " the king 's daughter turned away her eyes , and threw the lily into the boiling tar ; but it was altogether against her will , so fond had she grown of the beautiful flower .
