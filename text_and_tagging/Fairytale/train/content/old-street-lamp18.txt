it seemed to the lamp as if the whole world had turned round . but after a while the old watchman looked at the lamp and spoke of what they had both gone through together -- in rain and in fog , during the short , bright nights of summer or in the long winter nights , through the drifting snowstorms when he longed to be at home in the cellar . then the lamp felt that all was well again . it saw everything that had happened quite clearly , as if the events were passing before it . surely the wind had given it an excellent gift !
