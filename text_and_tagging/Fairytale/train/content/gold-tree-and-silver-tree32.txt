without a word the prince ran upstairs , and , sure enough , there was his dear gold - tree . she was sitting on the couch ready to welcome him . he was so overjoyed to see her that he threw his arms round her neck . he kissed her over and over again . he forgot his poor second wife , who had followed him upstairs , and who now stood watching the meeting that she had brought about . she did not seem to be sorry for herself , however . " i always knew that thy heart yearned after princess gold - tree , " she said . " and it is but right that it should be so . she was your first love . since she has come to life again , i will go back to mine own people . " " no , indeed you will not , " answered the prince . " it is you who have brought me this joy . you will stay with us , and we shall all three live happily together . and gold - tree and thee will become great friends . "
