when he arrived home he found his wife and daughter mourning for him , for they thought that he had been eaten by lions ; but he comforted them , saying that while following a wounded antelope he had missed his way and had wandered for a long time before he had found the path again . that night he asked zengi - mizi , in whom sat the spirit of his father , what he had better ask sipao for next ? ' biz - z - z , ' said the wasp , ' would you not like to be as great a chief as insato ? ' and gopani - kufa smiled , and took the mirror and said to it : ' sipao , sipao , i want a town as great as that of insato , the king of pita ; and i wish to be chief over it ! '
