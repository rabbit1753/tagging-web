momotaro landed , and with the hope of finding some way of entrance , walked up the path towards the top , followed by the monkey and the dog . they soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing clothes in a stream . momotaro saw that the clothes were blood - stained , and that as the two maidens washed , the tears were falling fast down their cheeks . he stopped and spoke to them : " who are you , and why do you weep ? " " we are captives of the demon king . we were carried away from our homes to this island , and though we are the daughters of daimios ( lords ) , we are obliged to be his servants , and one day he will kill us"--and the maidens held up the blood - stained clothes--"and eat us , and there is no one to help us !
