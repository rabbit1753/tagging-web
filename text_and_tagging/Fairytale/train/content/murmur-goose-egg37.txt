murmur goose - egg wanted the king to be the first to try the bridge with him . the king had no mind to do so , therefore murmur himself mounted a horse , and swung up the fat dairy - maid from the castle before him on the saddle - bow - she looked almost like a gigantic block of wood - and dashed across the bridge with her so that the planks fairly thundered . " where is my sound - toll ? where is the soul ? " cried the devil . " sitting in this block of wood ! if you want her , you must spit on your hands and catch hold of her , " said murmur goose - egg . " no , thank you ! if she does not catch hold of me , then i 'll certainly not catch hold of her , " said the devil . " you caught me in a vice once , but you ca n't fool me a second time , " said he , and flew straight home to his grandmother , and since then nothing more has been heard or seen of him .
