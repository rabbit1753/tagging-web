" god 's help to you , it 's bad clothing that 's on your body , " said the woman . " and now i will speak to ur . a day and a year since a champion passed this way . he wore a suit as good as was ever above ground . i had a daughter sewing there in the open window . he came outside , put a finger under her girdle , and took her with him . her father followed straightway to save her , but i have never seen daughter nor father from that day to this . that man was the green knight of terrible valley . he is better than all the men that could stand on a field a mile in length and a mile in breadth . if you take my advice you 'll turn back and go home to your father . " it is how she vexed ur with this talk , and he made a vow to himself to go on . when ur did not agree to turn home , the woman said to lawn dyarrig , " go back to my chamber ; you 'll find in it the apparel of a hero . " he went back , and there was not a bit of the apparel he did not go into with a spring . " you may be able to do something now , " said the woman , when lawn dyarrig came to the front . " go back to my chamber and search through all the old swords . you will find one at the bottom . take that . " he found the old sword , and at the first shake that he gave he knocked seven barrels of rust out of it ; after the second shake it was as bright as when made .
