wassamo in the mean while had lost the sound of his cousin 's voice in the rich simmer of the kettle ; and when its music pleased his ear the most , as announcing that the fish were handsomely cooked , he lifted the kettle from the fire . he spoke to his cousin , but he received no answer . he went on with his housekeeping alone , and took the wooden ladle and skimmed the kettle neatly , for the fish were very plump and fat . wassamo had a torch of twisted bark in one hand to give light , and when he came to take out the fish , there was no one to have charge of the torch . the cousin was so happy in his sleep , with the silver moon kissing his cheeks , as though she were enamored of his fair looks , that wassamo had not the heart to call him up . binding his girdle upon his brow , in this he thrust the torch , and went forward , with the light dancing through the green leaves at every turn of his head , to prepare the evening meal . he again spoke to his cousin , but gently , to learn whether he was in truth asleep . the cousin murmured , but made no reply ; and wassamo stepped softly about with the dancing fire - plume lighting up the gloom of the forest at every turn he made .
