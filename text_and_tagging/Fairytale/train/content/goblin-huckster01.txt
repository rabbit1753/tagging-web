there was once a regular student , who lived in a garret and had no possessions . and there was also a regular huckster , to whom the house belonged , and who occupied the ground floor . a goblin lived with the huckster because at christmas he always had a large dishful of jam , with a great piece of butter in the middle . the huckster could afford this , and therefore the goblin remained with him -- which was very shrewd of the goblin .
