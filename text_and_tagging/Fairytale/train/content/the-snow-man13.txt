' i ca n't understand him , ' said the snow - man ; ' but i have an idea that he is speaking of something unpleasant . that thing that glares so , and then disappears , the sun , as he calls it , is not my friend . i know that by instinct . ' ' bow - wow ! ' barked the yard - dog , and walked three times round himself , and then crept into his kennel to sleep . the weather really did change . towards morning a dense damp fog lay over the whole neighbourhood ; later on came an icy wind , which sent the frost packing . but when the sun rose , it was a glorious sight . the trees and shrubs were covered with rime , and looked like a wood of coral , and every branch was thick with long white blossoms . the most delicate twigs , which are lost among the foliage in summer - time , came now into prominence , and it was like a spider 's web of glistening white . the lady - birches waved in the wind ; and when the sun shone , everything glittered and sparkled as if it were sprinkled with diamond dust , and great diamonds were lying on the snowy carpet . ' is n't it wonderful ? ' exclaimed a girl who was walking with a young man in the garden . they stopped near the snow - man , and looked at the glistening trees . ' summer can not show a more beautiful sight , ' she said , with her eyes shining .
