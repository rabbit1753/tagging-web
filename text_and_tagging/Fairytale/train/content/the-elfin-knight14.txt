and this cup was filled with heather ale , which foamed up over the brim ; and when the knight saw sir gregory , he lifted it from the table , and handed it to him with a stately bow , and sir gregory , being very thirsty , drank . and as he drank he noticed that the ale in the goblet never grew less , but ever foamed up to the edge ; and for the first time his heart misgave him , and he wished that he had never set out on this strange adventure . but , alas ! the time for regrets had passed , for already a strange numbness was stealing over his limbs , and a chill pallor was creeping over his face , and before he could utter a single cry for help the goblet dropped from his nerveless fingers , and he fell down before the elfin king like a dead man . then a great shout of triumph went up from all the company ; for if there was one thing which filled their hearts with joy , it was to entice some unwary mortal into their ring and throw their uncanny spell over him , so that he must needs spend long years in their company .
