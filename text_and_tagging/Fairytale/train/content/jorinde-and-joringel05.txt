joringel looked up at jorinde . she had been changed into a nightingale , who was singing ' jug , jug . ' a night - owl with glowing eyes flew three times round her , and screeched three times ' tu - whit , tu - whit , tu - whoo . ' joringel could not stir ; he stood there like a stone ; he could not weep , or speak , or move hand or foot . now the sun set ; the owl flew into a bush , and immediately an old , bent woman came out of it ; she was yellow - skinned and thin , and had large red eyes and a hooked nose , which met her chin . she muttered to herself , caught the nightingale , and carried her away in her hand . joringel could say nothing ; he could not move from the spot , and the nightingale was gone .
