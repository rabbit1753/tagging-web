" if i had a grip on you that 's what you would n't ask me a second time , " said short - clothes . " if you have n't touched me , you will before you are much older . " " if you do , you will not treat me as you did all my people and my master . " " i 'll do worse to you than i did to them , " said lawn dyarrig . they caught each other then , one grip under the arm and one on the shoulder . it is not long they were wrestling when lawn dyarrig had short - clothes on the earth , and he gave him the five thin tyings dear and tight . " you are the best hero i have ever met , " said short - clothes ; " give me quarter for my soul -- spare me . when i did not tell you of my own will , i must tell in spite of myself . " " it is as easy for me to loosen you as to tie you , " said lawn dyarrig , and he freed him .
