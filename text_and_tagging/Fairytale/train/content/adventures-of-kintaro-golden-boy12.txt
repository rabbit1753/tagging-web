kintaro , however , said : " wait a moment . i will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes . " the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now . kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank . at last he stopped in front of a very large tree that was growing at the water 's edge . he took hold of the trunk and pulled it with all his might , once , twice , thrice ! at the third pull , so great was kintaro 's strength that the roots gave way , and " meri , meri " ( crash , crash ) , over fell the tree , forming an excellent bridge across the stream .
