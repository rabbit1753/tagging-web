the girl soon grew to be a woman , but the boy increased in stature very slowly . it was a long time before he could even creep , and he was well advanced in years before he could stand alone . when he was able to walk , his sister made him a little bow and arrows , and hung around his neck a small shell , saying : " you shall be called dais imid , or he of the little shell . " every day he would go out with his little bow , shooting at the small birds . the first bird he killed was a tom - tit . his sister was highly pleased when he took it to her . she carefully prepared and stuffed it , and put it away for him . the next day he killed a red squirrel . his sister preserved this , too . the third day he killed a partridge , and this they had for their evening meal . after this he acquired more courage , and would venture some distance from home . his skill and success as a hunter daily increased , and he killed the deer , bear , moose , and other large animals inhabiting the forest . at last , although so very small of stature , he became a great hunter , and all that he shot he brought home and shared with his sister ; and whenever he entered the lodge , a light beamed about his head and filled the place with a strange splendor .
