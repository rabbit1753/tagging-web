when the mouse had made up her fire and drawn water , she went to rest in her little room until it was time to lay the cloth . the sausage stayed by the saucepans , looked to it that the victuals were well cooked , and just before dinner - time he stirred the broth or the stew three or four times well round himself , so as to enrich and season and flavour it . then the bird used to come home and lay down his load , and they sat down to table , and after a good meal they would go to bed and sleep their fill till the next morning . it really was a most satisfactory life .
