when that was managed , the old woman took her daughter , put a cap on her , and laid her in the bed in the queen 's place , gave her also the queen 's form and countenance , only she could not restore the lost eye . so , in order that the king might not remark it , she had to lie on the side where there was no eye . in the evening , when the king came home and heard that a little son was born to him , he rejoiced with all his heart , and was going at once to his dear wife 's bedside to see how she did . then the old woman cried hastily , " for your life , do not draw back the curtains , to let in the light upon her ; she must be kept quiet . " so the king went away , and never knew that a false queen was lying in the bed .
