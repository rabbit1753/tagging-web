so they pulled down the statue of the happy prince . " as he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful , " said the art professor at the university . then they melted the statue in a furnace , and the mayor held a meeting of the corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal . " we must have another statue , of course , " he said , " and it shall be a statue of myself . " " of myself , " said each of the town councillors , and they quarrelled . when i last heard of them they were quarrelling still . " what a strange thing ! " said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry . " this broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace . we must throw it away . " so they threw it on a dust - heap where the dead swallow was also lying . " bring me the two most precious things in the city , " said god to one of his angels ; and the angel brought him the leaden heart and the dead bird . " you have rightly chosen , " said god , " for in my garden of paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore , and in my city of gold the happy prince shall praise me . "
