it happened that the king 's son gave a ball , and invited all persons of fashion to it . our young misses were also invited , for they cut a very grand figure among the quality . they were mightily delighted at this invitation , and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns , petticoats , and head - clothes as might become them . this was a new trouble to cinderella ; for it was she who ironed her sisters ' linen , and plaited their ruffles ; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed .
