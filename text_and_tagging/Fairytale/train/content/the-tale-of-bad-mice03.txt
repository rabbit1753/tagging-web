tom thumb and hunca munca went up - stairs and peeped into the dining - room . then they squeaked with joy ! such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table ! there were tin spoons , and lead knives and forks , and two dolly - chairs -- all so convenient ! tom thumb set to work at once to carve the ham . it was a beautiful shiny yellow , streaked with red . the knife crumpled up and hurt him ; he put his finger in his mouth . " it is not boiled enough ; it is hard . you have a try , hunca munca . " hunca munca stood up in her chair , and chopped at the ham with another lead knife . " it 's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger 's , " said hunca munca . the ham broke off the plate with a jerk , and rolled under the table . " let it alone , " said tom thumb ; " give me some fish , hunca munca ! "
