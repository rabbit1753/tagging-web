when the queen heard these words she turned quite cold with rage . she knew that her husband had deceived her . she rose from her knees and went straight home to the palace . she hid her anger as best she could . she asked him if he would give orders to have the long ship made ready , as she wished to go and visit her dear step - daughter . it was such a very long time since she had seen her . the king was somewhat surprised at her request , but he was only too glad to think that she had got over her hatred towards his daughter . he gave orders that the long ship should be made ready at once . soon it was speeding over the water , its prow turned in the direction of the land where the princess lived , steered by the queen herself . she knew the course that the boat ought to take . she was in such haste to be at her journey 's end that she would allow no one else to take the helm . now it chanced that princess gold - tree was alone that day . her husband had gone a - hunting . and as she looked out of one of the castle windows she saw a boat coming sailing over the sea towards the landing place . she recognised it as her father 's long ship . she guessed only too well whom it carried on board . she was almost beside herself with terror at the thought . she knew that it was for no good purpose that queen silver - tree had taken the trouble to set out to visit her . she felt that she would have given almost anything she possessed if her husband had but been at home . in her distress she hurried into the servants ' hall . " oh , what shall i do , what shall i do ? " she cried , " for i see my father 's long ship coming over the sea . i know that my step - mother is on board . and if she hath a chance she will kill me . she hateth me more than anything else upon earth .
