long , long ago , when all the animals could talk , there lived in the province of inaba in japan , a little white hare . his home was on the island of oki . just across the sea was the mainland of inaba . now the hare wanted very much to cross over to inaba . day after day he would go out and sit on the shore and look longingly over the water in the direction of inaba . day after day he hoped to find some way of getting across . one day as usual , the hare was standing on the beach , looking towards the mainland across the water , when he saw a great crocodile swimming near the island . " this is very lucky ! " thought the hare . " now i shall be able to get my wish . i will ask the crocodile to carry me across the sea ! "
