great joy was manifested upon their arrival at the starry plains . the star chief invited all his people to a feast . when they had assembled , he proclaimed aloud that each one might continue as he was , an inhabitant of his own dominions , or select of the earthly gifts such as he liked best . a very strange confusion immediately arose . not one but sprang forward . some chose a foot , some a wing , some a tail , and some a claw . those who selected tails or claws were changed into animals , and ran off . the others assumed the form of birds , and flew away . waupee chose a white hawk 's feather . his wife and son followed his example , and each one became a white hawk . he spread his wings , and , followed by his wife and son , descended with the other birds to the earth , where he is still to be found , with the brightness of the starry plains in his eye , and the freedom of the heavenly breezes in his wings .
