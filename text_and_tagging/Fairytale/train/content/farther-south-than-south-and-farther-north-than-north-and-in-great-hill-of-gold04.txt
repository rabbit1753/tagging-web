now it was the turn of john by the ashes . he did not lie down by the upper ridge of the field ; but lower down , and stayed awake . after he had lain there a while , three doves came flying along . they settled in the field , and that very moment shook off all their feathers , and turned into the most beautiful maidens one might wish to see . they danced with each other over the whole field ; and while they did so , the young fellow gathered up all their feathers . toward morning they wanted to put on their feathers again , but could not find them anywhere . then they were frightened , and wept and searched and searched and wept .
