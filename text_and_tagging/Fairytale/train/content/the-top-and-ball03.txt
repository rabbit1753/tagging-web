next day the ball was taken out by the boy . the top saw it flying high in the air , like a bird , till it would go quite out of sight . each time it came back , as it touched the earth , it gave a higher leap than before , either because it longed to fly upwards , or from having a spanish cork in its body . but the ninth time it rose in the air , it remained away , and did not return . the boy searched everywhere for it , but he searched in vain , for it could not be found ; it was gone . " i know very well where she is , " sighed the top ; " she is in the swallow 's nest , and has married the swallow . "
