' first give me your word that you will do nothing towards me that is not just , and when thou hast won for me that which i shall ask , then you shall we d my daughter . ' ' i promise right willingly , ' said kilweh . ' name what you will . ' ' you see the hill over there ? well , in one day it shall be rooted up and ploughed and sown , and the grain shall ripen , and of that wheat i will bake the cakes for my daughter 's wedding . '
