once upon a time , all the people of a certain country had died , excepting two helpless children , a baby boy and a little girl . when their parents died , these children were asleep . the little girl , who was the elder , was the first to awake . she looked around her , but seeing nobody beside her little brother , who lay smiling in his dreams , she quietly resumed her bed . at the end of ten days her brother moved , without opening his eyes . at the end of ten days more he changed his position , lying on the other side , and in this way he kept on sleeping for a long time ; and pleasant , too , must have been his dreams , for his little sister never looked at him that he was not quite a little heaven of smiles and flashing lights , which beamed about his head and filled the lodge with a strange splendor .
