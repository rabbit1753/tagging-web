a long , long time ago , a little boy was living with his sister entirely alone in an uninhabited country , far out in the north - west . he was called the boy that carries the ball on his back , from an idea that he possessed supernatural powers . this boy was in the habit of meditating alone , and asking within himself , whether there were other beings similar to themselves on the earth . when he grew up to manhood , he inquired of his sister whether she knew of any human beings beside themselves . she replied that she did ; and that there was , at a great distance , a large village . as soon as he heard this , he said to his sister , " i am now a young man and very much in want of a companion ; " and he asked his sister to make him several pairs of moccasins . she complied with his request ; and as soon as he received the moccasins , he took up his war - club and set out in quest of the distant village .
