before many days had passed he reached the southern island , and then slowly but surely made his way to the head - quarters of the chiefs kumaso and takeru . he now met with great difficulties , for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough . the mountains were high and steep , the valleys dark and deep , and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped the progress of his army . it was all but impossible to go on . though the prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years , and , seeing that it was vain to try and lead his men further , he said to himself : " to attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task harder . we can not clear the roads and fight as well . it is wiser for me to resort to stratagem and come upon my enemies unawares . in that way i may be able to kill them without much exertion . " so he now bade his army halt by the way . his wife , the princess ototachibana , had accompanied him , and he bade her bring him the robe his aunt the priestess of ise had given him , and to help him attire himself as a woman . with her help he put on the robe , and let his hair down till it flowed over his shoulders . ototachibana then brought him her comb , which he put in his black tresses , and then adorned himself with strings of strange jewels . when he had finished his unusual toilet , ototachibana brought him her mirror . he smiled as he gazed at himself - the disguise was so perfect .
