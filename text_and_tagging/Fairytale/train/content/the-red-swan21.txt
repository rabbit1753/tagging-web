maidwa told him of two or three others . the magician groaned again and again , and said , rather peevishly , " no , these are not the dreams . " " keep cool , " said the kettle , which had left the fire , and was standing in the middle of the floor , where a pleasant breeze was blowing through the lodge , and added , " have you no more dreams of another kind ? " " yes , " said maidwa ; and he told him one . " that will do , " said the kettle . " we are much pleased with that . " " yes , that is it -- that is it ! " the magician added . " you will cause me to live . that was what i was wishing you to say . will you then go and see if you can not recover my poor scalp ? " " yes , " said maidwa , " i will go ; and the day after to - morrow , when you hear the ka - kak cries of the hawk , you will know that i am successful . you must prepare your head , and lean it out through the door , so that the moment i arrive i may place your scalp on . " " yes , yes , " said the magician . " as you say it will be done . " early the next morning maidwa set out to fulfill his promise ; and in the afternoon , when the sun hangs toward home , he heard the shouts of a great many people . he was in a wood at the time , and saw , as he thought , only a few men , but as he went on they increased in numbers . on emerging upon the plain , their heads appeared like the hanging leaves , they were so many .
