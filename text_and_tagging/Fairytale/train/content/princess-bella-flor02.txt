' have you forgotten me ? ' asked the man . ' i ca n't forget a person i have never known , ' was the rude answer . ' i am your brother , ' replied the stranger , ' and i have returned home without the money i hoped to have made . and , what is worse , they tell me in the village that my father is dead . i would have counted my lost gold as nothing if i could have seen him once more . ' ' he died six months ago , ' said the rich brother , ' and he left you , as your portion , the old wooden chest that stands in the loft . you had better go there and look for it ; i have no more time to waste . ' and he went his way .
