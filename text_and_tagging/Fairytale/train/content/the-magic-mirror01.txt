a long , long while ago , before ever the white men were seen in senna , there lived a man called gopani - kufa . one day , as he was out hunting , he came upon a strange sight . an enormous python had caught an antelope and coiled itself around it . the antelope , striking out in despair with its horns , had pinned the python 's neck to a tree . so deeply had its horns sunk in the soft wood that neither creature could get away .
