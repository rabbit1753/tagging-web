but it had already been in it , and played out its part . and the man told them about humpty dumpty who fell downstairs and married a princess . the children clapped their hands and cried , ' another ! another ! ' they wanted the story of henny penny also , but they only got humpty dumpty . the fir - tree stood quite astonished and thoughtful ; the birds in the wood had never related anything like that . ' humpty dumpty fell downstairs and yet married a princess ! yes , that is the way of the world ! ' thought the tree , and was sure it must be true , because such a nice man had told the story . ' well , who knows ? perhaps i shall fall downstairs and marry a princess . ' and it rejoiced to think that next day it would be decked out again with candles , toys , glittering ornaments , and fruits . ' to - morrow i shall quiver again with excitement . i shall enjoy to the full all my splendour . to - morrow i shall hear humpty dumpty again , and perhaps henny penny too . ' and the tree stood silent and lost in thought all through the night .
