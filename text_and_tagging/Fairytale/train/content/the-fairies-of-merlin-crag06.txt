when he was finished he looked round for his strange visitor , but she had vanished completely . he could not tell how , nor where . putting up his spade , he wended his way homewards , and going straight to his master , he told him the whole story . he suggested that in future the peats should be taken from the other end of the moor . but the master only laughed . he was a strong , hearty man , and had no belief in ghosts , or elves , or fairies , or any other creature that he could not see . although he laughed , he was vexed that his servant should believe in such things , so to cure him , as he thought , of his superstition , he ordered him to take a horse and cart and go back at once , and lift all the peats and bring them to dry in the farm steading . the poor man obeyed with much reluctance . he was greatly relieved , as weeks went on , to find that , in spite of his having done so , no harm befell him .
