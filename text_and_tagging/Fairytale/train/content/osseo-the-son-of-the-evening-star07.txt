a moment more and his brothers and sisters , and their parents and friends , were transformed into birds of various plumage . some were jays , some partridges and pigeons , and others gay singing birds , who hopped about , displaying their many - colored feathers , and singing songs of cheerful note . but his wife , oweenee , still kept her earthly garb , and exhibited all the indications of extreme old age . he again cast his eyes in the direction of the clouds , and uttered the peculiar cry which had given him the victory at the rock . in a moment the youth and beauty of his wife returned ; her dingy garments assumed the shining appearance of green silk , and her staff was changed into a silver feather . the lodge again shook and trembled , for they were now passing through the uppermost clouds , and they immediately after found themselves in the evening star , the residence of osseo 's father . " my son , " said the old man , " hang that cage of birds which you have brought along in your hand at the door , and i will inform you why you and your wife have been sent for . " osseo obeyed , and then took his seat in the lodge . " pity was shown to you , " resumed the king of the star , " on account of the contempt of your wife 's sister , who laughed at her ill fortune , and ridiculed you while you were under the power of that wicked spirit whom you overcame at the rock . that spirit lives in the next lodge , being the small star you see on the left of mine , and he has always felt envious of my family because we had greater power , and especially that we had committed to us the care of the female world . he failed in many attempts to destroy your brothers and sisters - in - law , but succeeded at last in transforming yourself and your wife into decrepid old persons . you must be careful and not let the light of his beams fall on you , while you are here , for therein lies the power of his enchantment . a ray of light is the bow and arrow he uses .
