once upon a time there was a king who had three sons , who were all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign over the kingdom before he was dead . now the king , though he felt that he was growing old , did not at all wish to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very well , so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came for keeping them . so he sent for them all , and , after speaking to them kindly , he added : " you will quite agree with me , my dear children , that my great age makes it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as i once did . i begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects , therefore i wish that one of you should succeed to my crown ; but in return for such a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me . now , as i think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without any regard for your ages , i promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful little dog shall succeed me at once .
