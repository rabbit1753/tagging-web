then he was told to keep a mill grinding which the evil one often brought to a stop . no sooner had aspenclog commenced to grind than , sure enough , the mill stopped . aspenclog took a candle and made a search . no doubt of it , the evil one had wedged his leg between the mill - stones . no sooner had aspenclog seen the leg , than he chopped it off with his club . then the evil one came hobbling up on one leg , and begged fearfully and tearfully for the leg he had lost . no , he could not have it , said the youth , unless he gave him a bushel of money for it . but when the evil one had to pay aspenclog the money , he thought to cheat him , and said that they would wager bushel against bushel , as to which of them could throw the highest . they argued a while about which was to throw first . at last aspenclog had to begin . now the evil one had a ball with which they were to throw . aspenclog stood a long time looking at the moon . " why do you do that ? " asked the evil one . " well , i would like to see whether i can not throw the ball into the moon , " said aspenclog . " do you see those black spots ? those are the balls i have already thrown up into the moon . " then the evil one was afraid of losing his ball , and he did not dare to let aspenclog throw .
