after they had become able to hunt and to take care of themselves , the elder proposed to leave them and to go in search of the world , promising to return as soon as he could procure them wives . in this intention he was overruled by his brothers , who said that they could not part with him . jeekewis , the second , was loud in disapproval of the scheme , saying : " what will you do with those you propose to get ? we have lived so long by ourselves , we can still do without them . " this counsel prevailed , and for a time the three brothers continued together . one day they agreed to kill each a male of that kind of animal , which each was most expert in hunting , for the purpose of making quivers from their skins . when these quivers were prepared , they were straightway filled , with arrows . they all had a presentiment that something was about to happen which called upon them to be ready . soon after they hunted on a wager to see who should come in first with game , and have the privilege of acting as entertainer to the others . they were to shoot no other beast or bird than such as each was in the habit of killing . they set out on different paths . maidwa , the youngest , had not gone far before he saw a bear , an animal he was not to kill , by the agreement . he , however , followed him closely , and driving an arrow through and through him , he brought him to the ground . although contrary to the engagement with his brothers , maidwa commenced skinning him , when suddenly something red tinged the air all around him . he rubbed his eyes , thinking he was perhaps deceived . but rub as hard as he would , the red hue still crimsoned the air , and tinged every object that he looked on -- the tree - tops , the river that flowed , and the deer that glided away along the edge of the forest -- with its delicate splendor .
