knos was given a place at the king 's court , and his duty was to help the cook . but he asked to be let off on the day the troll was to come and carry away the oldest princess , and they were glad to let him go ; for when he had to rinse the dishes he broke the king 's vessels of gold and silver ; and when he was told to bring firewood , he brought in a whole wagon - load at once , so that the doors flew from their hinges .
