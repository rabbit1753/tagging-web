" who is there ? " cried the giant . he rushed out of his hill with a hunk of flint - rock in his fist . " i am , if that 's what you want to know ! " shouted the shepherd - lad and continued driving his goats up the hill . " if you come here , i will squash you as i squash this stone ! " cried the giant . he crushed it into fine sand between his fingers . " and i will squash you till the water runs out , just as i squash this stone ! " answered the shepherd - lad , drawing a fresh cheese from his pocket , and pressing it hard , so that the water ran from his fingers .
