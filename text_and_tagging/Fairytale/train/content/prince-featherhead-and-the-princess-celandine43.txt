' why should you not ? ' said the princess timidly . ' surely there is nothing to prevent you . ' ' nothing to prevent me ! ' repeated he , ' when my utmost efforts have failed to discover the lovely original . should i be so sad if i could but find her ? but i do not even know her name . ' more surprised than ever , the princess asked to be allowed to see the portrait , and after examining it for a few minutes returned it , remarking shyly that at least the original had every cause to be satisfied with it . ' that means that you consider it flattered , ' said the prince severely . ' really , celandine , i thought better of you , and should have expected you to be above such contemptible jealousy . but all women are alike ! ' ' indeed , i meant only that it was a good likeness , ' said the princess meekly . ' then you know the original , ' cried the prince , throwing himself on his knees beside her . ' pray tell me at once who it is , and do n't keep me in suspense ! ' ' oh ! do n't you see that it is meant for me ? ' cried celandine . the prince sprang to his feet , hardly able to refrain from telling her that she must be blinded by vanity to suppose she resembled the lovely portrait even in the slightest degree ; and after gazing at her for an instant with icy surprise , turned and left her without another word , and in a few hours quitted the leafy palace altogether .
