presently it began to rain , and the drops fell faster and faster , till there was a heavy shower . when it was over , two boys happened to pass by , and one of them said , " look , there is a tin soldier . he ought to have a boat to sail in . " so they made a boat out of a newspaper , and placed the tin soldier in it , and sent him sailing down the gutter , while the two boys ran by the side of it , and clapped their hands . good gracious , what large waves arose in that gutter ! and how fast the stream rolled on ! for the rain had been very heavy . the paper boat rocked up and down , and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled ; yet he remained firm ; his countenance did not change ; he looked straight before him , and shouldered his musket . suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain , and then it was as dark as the tin soldier 's box .
