they went out into the woods , and at the close of the afternoon they brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds . the young man , as soon as he had laid aside his weapons , said to the old toad - woman , " send some of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately . " the toad - woman answered , " no ! why should i send to her , the poor widow ! " the young man would not be refused ; and at last the old toad - woman consented to take something and throw it down at the door . she called out , " my son gives you this . " but , being bewitched by mukakee mindemoea , it was so bitter and distasteful , that the young woman immediately cast it out of the lodge after her . in the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of cedar - boughs . she then told him that she was his real mother , and that he had been stolen away from her by the old toad - woman , who was a child - thief and a witch . as the young man appeared to doubt , she added , " feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge ; and when the toad - woman asks what ails you , say that you wish to see your cradle ; for your cradle was of wampum , and your faithful brother the dog , in striving to save you , tore off these pieces which i show you .
