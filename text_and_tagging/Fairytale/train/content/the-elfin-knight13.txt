but earl gregory only laughed . " i vowed that i would follow the green knight , " he replied , " and i will carry out my vow , even if the venture leadeth me close to the nethermost world . " and with these words he stepped over the edge of the circle , right in amongst the ghostly dancers . at his coming they shouted louder than ever , and danced more madly , and sang more lustily ; then , all at once , a silence fell upon them , and they parted into two companies , leaving a way through their midst , up which they signed to the earl to pass . he walked through their ranks till he came to the middle of the circle ; and there , seated at a table of red marble , was the knight whom he had come so far to seek , clad in his grass - green robes . and before him , on the table , stood a wondrous goblet , fashioned from an emerald , and set round the rim with blood - red rubies .
