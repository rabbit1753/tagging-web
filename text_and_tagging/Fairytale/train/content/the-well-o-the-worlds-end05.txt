so she called to her daughter , who was in the garden . when the girl came she held out the empty jug to her , saying , " run , like a good lassie , to the well of the world 's end and bring me a jug of water . i have long found that water from the well of the world 's end makes the best cakes . " so the girl took the jug and set out on her errand . now , as its name shows , it is a long road to that well , and many a weary mile had the poor maid to go before she reached it . but she arrived there at last . it was her disappointment to find it dry . she was so tired and so vexed that she sat down beside it and began to cry . she did not know where to get any more water , and she felt that she could not go back to her mother with an empty jug . while she was crying , a nice yellow paddock , with very bright eyes , came jump - jump - jumping over the stones of the well . it squatted down at her feet , looking up into her face .
