john promised , and thanked him for the quick journey . the man drove off on his way , and john crossed the hill to his home . as he went he heard a roaring in the jutulsberg , and the path before him suddenly grew so bright that one could have picked a needle from the ground . and he forgot what he had promised , and turned his head to see what was happening . there stood the giant gate of the jutulsberg wide open , and out of it streamed a light and radiance as of thousands of candles . in the midst of it all stood the giant , and he was the man with whom he had driven . but from that time forward john 's head was twisted , and so it remained as long as he lived .
