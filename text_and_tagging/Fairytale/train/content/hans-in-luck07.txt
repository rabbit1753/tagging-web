" never mind , " said hans . " i can find a remedy . i will milk my cow at once . " and tying her to a dry tree , and taking off his leather cap to serve for a pail , he began to milk , but not a drop came . and as he set to work rather awkwardly , the impatient beast gave him such a kick on the head with his hind foot that he fell to the ground . for some time could not think where he was . when luckily there came by a butcher who was wheeling along a young pig in a wheelbarrow . " here 's a fine piece of work ! " cried he , helping poor hans on his legs again . then hans related to him all that had happened . the butcher handed him his pocket - flask , saying , " here , take a drink , and be a man again . of course the cow would give no milk . she is old and only fit to draw burdens , or to be slaughtered .
