when the princess heard this she began to cry , but it was no good ; she had to keep her word . she took leave of her father , put a knife in her belt , and went to the iron stove in the wood . as soon as she reached it she began to scrape , and the iron gave way and before two hours had passed she had made a little hole . then she peeped in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot . so she scraped away harder than ever , and made the hole so large that he could get out . then he said , ' you are mine , and i am thine ; you are my bride and have set me free !
