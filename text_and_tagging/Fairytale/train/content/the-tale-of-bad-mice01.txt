once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll 's house ; it was red brick with white windows , and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney . it belonged to two dolls called lucinda and jane ; at least it belonged to lucinda , but she never ordered meals . jane was the cook ; but she never did any cooking , because the dinner had been bought ready - made , in a box full of shavings . there were two red lobsters , and a ham , a fish , a pudding , and some pears and oranges . they would not come off the plates , but they were extremely beautiful .
