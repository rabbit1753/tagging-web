then the sun shone so brightly , and right before her stood an angel of god in white robes ; it was the same one whom she had seen that night at the church - door . he no longer carried the sharp sword , but a beautiful green branch , full of roses ; with this he touched the ceiling , which rose up very high , and where he had touched it there shone a golden star . he touched the walls , which opened wide apart , and she saw the organ which was pealing forth ; she saw the pictures of the old pastors and their wives , and the congregation sitting in the polished chairs and singing from their hymn - books . the church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room , or the room had gone to the church . she sat in the pew with the rest of the pastor 's household , and when they had finished the hymn and looked up , they nodded and said , " it was right of you to come , karen .
