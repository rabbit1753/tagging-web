a little back from the high road there stands a house which is called ' hemgard . ' perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by the reddish - brown palings , and the high gate . or you remember the garden with the beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown in spring , and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful berries . behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the morning wind . behind the hedge is a road , behind the road is a wood , and behind the wood the wide world . but on the other side of the garden there is a lake , and beyond the lake is a village , and all around stretch meadows and fields , now yellow , now green . in the pretty house , which has white window - frames , a neat porch and clean steps , which are always strewn with finely - cut juniper leaves , walter 's parents live . his brother frederick , his sister lotta , old lena , jonah , caro and bravo , putte and murre , and kuckeliku . caro lives in the dog house , bravo in the stable , putte with the stableman , murre a little here and a little there , and kuckeliku lives in the hen house , that is his kingdom .
