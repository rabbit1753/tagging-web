" i hope you will be patient with me , " said momotaro ; " but before i begin to pay back your goodness to me i have a request to make which i hope you will grant me above everything else . " " i will let you do whatever you wish , for you are quite different to all other boys ! " " then let me go away at once ! " " what do you say ? do you wish to leave your old father and mother and go away from your old home ? " " i will surely come back again , if you let me go now ! " " where are you going ? "
