after talking with them a little while , he discovered that whenever he addressed the one on his left hand , the tree would tremble as before and settle down to its former place ; but when he addressed the one on his right hand , it would again shoot upward . when he thus perceived that by addressing the one on his left hand that the tree would descend , he continued to do so until it had again settled down to its place near the earth . then seizing his war - club , he said to the sisters : " you who have caused the death of so many of my brethren i will now put an end to , and thus have revenge for those you have destroyed . " as he spoke this he raised the club , and with one blow laid the two wicked women dead at his feet . onwee then descended , and learning that these sisters had a brother living with their father , who had shared all together in the spoils of all such as the wicked sisters had betrayed , and who would now pursue him for having put an end to their wicked profits , onwee set off at random , not knowing whither he went .
