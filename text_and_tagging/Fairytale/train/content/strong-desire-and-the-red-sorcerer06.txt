" and are you afraid now , " she asked again . " i am , " again answered strong desire , without hesitation . " but you are not afraid to speak the truth , " rejoined the little old woman . " you will be a brave man yet . " she cheered him with the assurance of her friendship , and began at once to exercise her power upon him . his hair being very short , she took a great leaden comb , and after drawing it through his locks several times , they became of a handsome length like those of a beautiful young woman . she then proceeded to dress him as a female , furnishing him with the necessary garments , and tinting his face with colors of the most charming dye . she gave him , too , a bowl of shining metal . she directed him to put in his girdle a blade of scented sword - grass , and to proceed the next morning to the banks of the lake , which was no other than that over which the red head reigned . now hah - undo - tah , or the red head , was a most powerful sorcerer , living upon an island in the centre of his realm of water , and he was the terror of all the country . she informed him that there would be many indians upon the island , who , as soon as they saw him use the shining bowl to drink with , would come and solicit him to be their wife , and to take him over to the island . these offers he was to refuse , and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the red head , and that if the chief could not seek her for himself , she would return to her village . she said , that as soon as the red head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe , in which she must embark .
