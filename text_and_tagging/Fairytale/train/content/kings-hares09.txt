when they were through she gave esben a whistle which had the power that if he blew into one end , whatever he wished scattered was scattered to all the winds , and when he blew into the other , all came together again . and if the whistle passed from his possession , it would return as soon as he wished it back . " that is a wonderful whistle ! " thought esben . when he came to the castle , they at once took him on as a shepherd . the place was not bad , he was to have food and wages , and should he manage to herd the king 's hares without losing one of them , he might possibly win the princess . but if he lost so much as a single hare , and no matter how small it might be , then they would cut three red strips from his back , and the king was so sure of his case that he went right off to whet his knife . it would be a simple matter to herd the hares , thought esben . for when they went off they were as obedient as a herd of sheep , and so long as they were on the common , and in the enclosure , they even marched in rank and file . but when they reached the forest , and noon - time came , and the sun burned down on hill and dale , they all took to their heels and ran away across the hills .
