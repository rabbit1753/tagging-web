on the following sunday they all went to church , and she was asked whether she wished to go too ; but , with tears in her eyes , she looked sadly at her crutches . and then the others went to hear god 's word , but she went alone into her little room ; this was only large enough to hold the bed and a chair . here she sat down with her hymn - book , and as she was reading it with a pious mind , the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church , and in tears she lifted up her face and said : " o god ! help me ! "
