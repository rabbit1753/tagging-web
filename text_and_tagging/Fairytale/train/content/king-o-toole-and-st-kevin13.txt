' well , honest man , ' says the king , ' and how is it you make your money so easy ? ' ' by makin ' old things as good as new , ' says saint kavin . ' is it a tinker you are ? ' says the king . ' no , ' says the saint ; ' i 'm no tinker by trade , king o'toole . i 've a better thrade than a tinker , ' says he . ' what would you say , ' says he , ' if i made your old goose as good as new ? ' ' my dear , at the word o ' making his goose as good as new , you 'd think the poor old king 's eyes was ready to jump out of his head . ' ' and , ' says he--'truth , then , i 'd give you more money nor you could count , ' says he , ' if you did the like , and i 'd be beholden to you in the bargain . ' ' i scorn your dirty money , ' says saint kavin . ' faith , then , i 'm thinkin ' a trifle o ' change would do you no harm , ' says the king , lookin ' up sly at the old hat that saint kavin had on him . ' i have a vow agin it , ' says the saint . ' i am book sworn , ' says he , ' never to have gold , silver , or brass in my company . ' ' barrin ' the trifle you ca n't help , ' says the king , mighty cute , and looking him straight in the face . ' you just hot it , ' says saint kavin . ' but though i ca n't take money , ' says he , ' i could take a few acres o ' land , if you 'd give them to me . ' ' with all the veins o ' my heart , ' says the king , ' if you can do what you say . ' ' try me ! ' says saint kavin . ' call down your goose here , ' says he , ' and i 'll see what i can do for her . ' with that the king whistled , and down came the poor goose , all as one as a hound , waddlin ' up to the poor old cripple , her master , and as like him as two pays . the minute the saint set his eyes on the goose , ' i 'll do the job for you , ' says he , ' king o'toole ! ' ' by jaminee , ' says king o'toole , ' if you do , but i 'll say you 're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes . ' ' oh , by dad , ' says saint kavin , ' you must say more nor that -- my horn 's not so soft all out , ' says he , ' as to repair your old goose for nothin' . ' what 'll you give me if i do the job for you?--that 's the chat , ' says saint kavin . ' i 'll give you whatever you ask , ' says the king . ' is n't that fair ? ' ' devil a fairer , ' says the saint . ' that 's the way to do business . now , ' says he , ' this is the bargain i 'll make with you , king o'toole : will you give me all the ground the goose flies over , the first offer , after i make her as good as new ? ' ' i will , ' says the king . ' you wo n't go back o ' your word ? ' says saint kavin . ' honor bright ! ' says king o'toole , holdin ' out his fist . ' honor bright , ' says saint kavin back again , ' it 's a bargain , ' says he . ' come here ! ' says he to the poor old goose--'come here , you unfortunate old cripple , ' says he , ' and it 's i that 'll make you the sportin ' bird . '
