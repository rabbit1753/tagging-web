now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit , he had no use for the seed he had just found . the persimmon - seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone . he , therefore , in his greedy nature , felt very envious of the crab 's nice dumpling , and he proposed an exchange . the crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone - like seed , and would not consent to the monkey 's proposition . in the following spring the crab was delighted to see the shoot of a young tree push its way up through the ground . each year it grew bigger , till at last it blossomed one spring , and in the following autumn bore some fine large persimmons . among the broad smooth green leaves the fruit hung like golden balls , and as they ripened they mellowed to a deep orange . it was the little crab 's pleasure to go out day by day and sit in the sun and put out his long eyes in the same way as a snail puts out its horn , and watch the persimmons ripening to perfection .
