in an instant the revelry ceased , and the fairies , with cries of alarm , crowded together and rushed towards the crag , dragging the countryman along in their midst . as they reached the rock , a mysterious door , which he never remembered having seen before , opened in it of its own accord , and shut again with a crash as soon as the fairy host had all trooped through . the door led into a large , dimly lighted hall full of tiny couches . here the little folk sank to rest , tired out with their exertions , while the good man sat down on a piece of rock in the corner , wondering what would happen next . but there seemed to be some kind of spell thrown over his senses . even when the fairies awoke and began to go about their household occupations , and to carry out certain curious practices which he had never seen before , and which , as you will hear , he was forbidden to speak of afterwards , he was content to sit and watch them , without in any way attempting to escape .
