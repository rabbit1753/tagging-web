" what a heavy creature you have there ! " said the peasant . " it has plenty of feathers and plenty of fat , and would look well tied to a string , or paddling in the water at our place . that would be very useful to my old woman ; she could make all sorts of profit out of it . how often she has said , ' if we only had a goose ! ' now here is an opportunity , and , if possible , i will get it for her . shall we exchange ? i will give you my sheep for your goose , and thanks into the bargain . "
