then kintaro and the woodcutter both put out their right arms and grasped each other 's hands . for a long time kintaro and the old man wrestled together in this way , each trying to bend the other 's arm , but the old man was very strong , and the strange pair were evenly matched . at last the old man desisted , declaring it a drawn game . " you are , indeed , a very strong child . there are few men who can boast of the strength of my right arm ! " said the woodcutter . " i saw you first on the banks of the river a few hours ago , when you pulled up that large tree to make a bridge across the torrent . hardly able to believe what i saw i followed you home . your strength of arm , which i have just tried , proves what i saw this afternoon . when you are full - grown you will surely be the strongest man in all japan . it is a pity that you are hidden away in these wild mountains . " then he turned to kintaro 's mother : " kimbo , " said his mother , " mind and be a good boy . " " mr . kintaro , " said the faithful animals , " we wish you good health on your travels . " then they all climbed a tree to see the last of him . from that height they watched him and his shadow gradually grow smaller and smaller , till he was lost to sight . the general sadamitsu went on his way rejoicing at having so unexpectedly found such a prodigy as kintaro . having arrived at their destination the general took kintaro at once to his lord , minamoto - no - raiko . he told him all about kintaro and how he had found the child . lord raiko was delighted with the story , and having commanded kintaro to be brought to him , made him one of his vassals at once .
