' i should like him for a pet , ' thought the girl . the next time the fish swam by , she put out her hand and caught him . then she ran along the grassy path till she came to a cave in front of which a stream fell over some rocks into a basin . here she put her little fish , whose name was djulung - djulung , and promising to return soon and bring him some dinner . she went away . by the time she got home , the rice for their dinner was ready cooked . the eldest sister gave the other six their portions in wooden bowls . but the youngest did not finish hers , and when no one was looking , stole off to the fountain in the forest where the little fish was swimming about . ' see ! i have not forgotten you , ' she cried . one by one she let the grains of rice fall into the water , where the fish gobbled them up greedily . he had never tasted anything so nice . ' that is all for to - day , ' she said at last , ' but i will come again to - morrow , ' and biding him good - bye she went down the path . now the girl did not tell her sisters about the fish , but every day she saved half of her rice to give him , and called him softly in a little song she had made for herself . if she sometimes felt hungry , no one knew of it , and , indeed , she did not mind that much , when she saw how the fish enjoyed it . and the fish grew fat and big , but the girl grew thin and weak . the loads of wood felt heavier every day . at last her sisters noticed it .
