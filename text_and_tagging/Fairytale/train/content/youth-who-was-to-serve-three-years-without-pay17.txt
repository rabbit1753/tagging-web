" that 's all very fine , " declared the king , " just come in and we 'll talk it over , " said he , for he had noticed that the youth knew a thing or two , and he was thinking over how he might get rid of him . the king went on ahead , and after him the queen , and then went the princess , just in advance of the youth . then he at once wished to be the handsomest man in the world , and so he was , that very minute . when the princess saw what a splendid figure he suddenly cut , she nudged the queen , who in turn nudged the king , and after they had stared at him long enough , they at last realized that the youth was more than he had at first appeared to be , in his rags . so they decided that the princess was to treat him nicely , in order to find out how matters really stood , and the princess was as sweet and amiable as sugar - bread , and flattered the youth , and said that she could not do without him , night or day . and when it came toward the end of the first evening , she said : " since you and i are to be married in any case , i am sure you will have no secrets from me , and you will not want to hide from me how you managed to do all these fine things .
