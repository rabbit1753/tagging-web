" what a mercy that was not a pike ! " said mr . jeremy fisher . " i have lost my rod and basket ; but it does not much matter , for i am sure i should never have dared to go fishing again ! " he put some sticking plaster on his fingers , and his friends both came to dinner . he could not offer them fish , but he had something else in his larder . sir isaac newton wore his black and gold waistcoat , and mr . alderman ptolemy tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag . and instead of a nice dish of minnows -- they had a roasted grasshopper with lady - bird sauce ; which frogs consider a beautiful treat ; but _ i _ think it must have been nasty !
