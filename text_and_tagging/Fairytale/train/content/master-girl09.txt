" now you must slaughter him , and cook him in the big kettle , you know which one i mean . and when the soup is ready , you can call me , " said the giant . he lay down on the bench to sleep , and at once began to snore so that the hills shook . then the master girl took a knife , and cut the youth 's little finger , and let three drops of blood fall on the bench . then she took all the old rags , and old shoes and other rubbish she could find , and threw them all into the kettle . and then she took a chest of gold - dust , and a lick - stone , and a bottle of water that hung over the door , and a golden apple , and two golden hens . she left the giant 's castle together with the king 's son as quickly as possible . after a time they came to the sea , and they sailed across . though where they got the ship , i do not exactly know .
