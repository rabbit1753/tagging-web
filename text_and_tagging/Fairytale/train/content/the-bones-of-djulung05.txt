' what a curious leaf ! i have never beheld one like it before . i must show it to the king , ' he said . when the king saw it he declared he would never rest until he had found the tree which bore it , even if he had to spend the rest of his life in visiting the islands that lay all round . happily for him , he began with the island that was nearest . here in the forest he suddenly saw standing before him the iron tree . its boughs covered with shining leaves like the one he carried about him . ' but what sort of a tree is it , and how did it get here ? ' he asked of the attendants he had with him . no one could answer him . as they were about to pass out of the forest a little boy went by , and the king stopped and inquired if there was anyone living in the neighbourhood whom he might question . ' seven girls live in a hut down there , ' replied the boy , pointing with his finger to where the sun was setting . ' then go and bring them here , and i will wait , ' said the king . the boy ran off and told the sisters that a great chief , with strings of jewels round his neck , had sent for them .
