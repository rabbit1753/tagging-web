' and passing the table to the old man , he hung the bag over his arm . five minutes later he summoned five hundred lancers out of the cornet and bade them go after the old man and fetch back the table . now that by his cunning he had obtained possession of the three magic objects , he resolved to return to his native place . smearing his face with dirt , and tearing his clothes so as to look like a beggar , he stopped the passers by and , on pretence of seeking money or food , he questioned them about the village gossip . in this manner he learned that his brothers had become great men , much respected in all the country round . when he heard that , he lost no time in going to the door of their fine house and imploring them to give him food and shelter ; but the only thing he got was hard words , and a command to beg elsewhere . at length , however , at their mother 's entreaty , he was told that he might pass the night in the stable . here he waited until everybody in the house was sound asleep , when he drew his bag from under his cloak , and desired that a castle might appear in that place ; and the cornet gave him soldiers to guard the castle , while the table furnished him with a good supper . in the morning , he caused it all to vanish , and when his brothers entered the stable they found him lying on the straw .
