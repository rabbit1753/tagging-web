when the guardian 's servant heard how large a sum it was , he was tempted to win so wealthy a man for a son - in - law , and he married him to his daughter . finally the guardian heard of the matter and came to laotsze together with the servant . then laotsze said to his servant : " you rascally servant . you really should have been dead long ago . i hired you , and since i was poor and could give you no money , i gave you a life - giving talisman to eat . that is how you still happen to be alive . i said to you : ' if you will follow me into the west , the land of blessed repose , i will pay you your wages in yellow gold . but you did not wish to do this . ' " and with that he patted his servant 's neck . there upon the latter opened his mouth , and spat out the life - giving talisman . the magic signs written on it with cinnabar , quite fresh and well - preserved , might still be seen . but the servant suddenly collapsed and turned into a heap of dry bones . then the guardian of the pass cast himself to earth and pleaded for him . he promised to pay the servant for laotsze and begged the latter to restore him to life . so laotsze placed the talisman among the bones and at once the servant came to life again . the guardian of the pass paid him his wages and dismissed him . then he adored laotsze as his master , and the latter taught him the art of eternal life , and left him his teachings , in five thousand words , which the guardian wrote down . the book which thus came into being is the tao teh king , " the book of the way and life . " laotsze then disappeared from the eyes of men . the guardian of the pass however , followed his teachings , and was given a place among the immortals .
