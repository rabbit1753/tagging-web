" and as for the narrow road , all hampered and hindered by the thorns and the briars , there be few that be troubled to ask where that leadeth to . but did they ask , perchance more of them might be stirred up to set out along it . for that is the road of righteousness ; and , although it be hard and irksome , yet it endeth in a glorious city , which is called the city of the great king . " " and the third road -- the bonnie road -- that runs up the brae among the ferns , and leadeth no mortal kens whither , but i ken where it leadeth , thomas -- for it leadeth unto fair elf - land ; and that road take we . " " and , mark'ee , thomas , if ever thou hopest to see thine own tower of ercildoune again , take care of thy tongue when we reach our journey 's end , and speak no single word to anyone save me -- for the mortal who openeth his lips rashly in fairy - land must bide there for ever .
