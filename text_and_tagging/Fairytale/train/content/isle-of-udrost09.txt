but when isaac got underway , and looked around , there was no udrost in sight . far and wide , all around him , he saw no more than the ocean . when the time came , isaac sailed to join the man of udrost 's fishing - craft . but such a craft he had never seen before . it was two hails long , so that when the steersman , who was on look - out in the stern , wanted to call out something to the rower , the latter could not hear him . so they had stationed another man in the middle of the ship , close by the mast , who had to relay the steersman 's call to the rower , and even he had to shout as loudly as he could in order to make himself heard .
