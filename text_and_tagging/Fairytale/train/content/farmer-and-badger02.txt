the farmer 's trouble and patience was rewarded , for one fine day on going his rounds he found the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose . the farmer was delighted at having caught his enemy , and carried him home securely bound with rope . when he reached the house the farmer said to his wife : " i have at last caught the bad badger . you must keep an eye on him while i am out at work and not let him escape , because i want to make him into soup to - night .
