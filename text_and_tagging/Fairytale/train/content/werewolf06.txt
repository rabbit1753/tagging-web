once upon a time there was a king , who reigned over a great kingdom . he had a queen , but only a single daughter , a girl . in consequence the little girl was the apple of her parents ' eyes . they loved her above everything else in the world , and their dearest thought was the pleasure they would take in her when she was older . but the unexpected often happens . before the king 's daughter began to grow up , the queen her mother fell ill and died . it is not hard to imagine the grief that reigned , not alone in the royal castle , but throughout the land ; for the queen had been beloved of all . the king grieved so that he would not marry again , and his one joy was the little princess . from that day forward the princess gave her father no peace , and begged him again and again to marry the good court lady . yet he did not want to marry her . but the king 's daughter gave him no rest . she urged him again and again , as the false court lady had persuaded her to do . finally , one day , when she again brought up the matter , the king cried : " i can see you will end by having your own way about this , even though it be entirely against my will . but i will do so only on one condition . " " what is the condition ? " asked the princess . " if i marry again , " said the king , " it is only because of your ceaseless pleading . therefore you must promise that , if in the future you are not satisfied with your step - mother or your step - sisters , not a single lament or complaint on your part reaches my ears . " this she promised the king , and it was agreed that he should marry the court lady and make her queen of the whole country .
