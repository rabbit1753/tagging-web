the dog soon came into the lodge , and she set before him the dish of grape - juice . " see , my child , " she said , addressing him , " the pretty drink your mother gives you . " spirit - iron took a long draught , and immediately left the lodge with his eyes wide open ; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth of things as they are . he rose up when he got into the open air , stood upon his hind legs , and looked about . " i see how it is , " he said ; and marching off , erect like a man , he sought out his young master . approaching him in great confidence , he bent down and whispered in his ear ( having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was listening ) , " this old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours . i have found your real mother , and she is worth looking at . when we come back from our day 's sport , i 'll prove it to you .
