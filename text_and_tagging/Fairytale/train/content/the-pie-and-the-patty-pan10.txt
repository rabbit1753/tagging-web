very punctually at four o'clock , duchess started to go to the party . she ran so fast through the village that she was too early , and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to ribby 's house . " i wonder if ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet ? " said duchess , " and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse ? " at a quarter past four to the minute , there came a most genteel little tap - tappity . " is mrs . ribston at home ? " inquired duchess in the porch . " come in ! and how do you do , my dear duchess ? " cried ribby . " i hope i see you well ? " " quite well , i thank you , and how do you do , my dear ribby ? " said duchess . " i 've brought you some flowers ; what a delicious smell of pie ! " " oh , what lovely flowers ! yes , it is mouse and bacon ! " " do not talk about food , my dear ribby , " said duchess ; " what a lovely white tea - cloth ! .... is it done to a turn ? is it still in the oven ? " " i think it wants another five minutes , " said ribby . " just a shade longer ; i will pour out the tea , while we wait . do you take sugar , my dear duchess ? " " oh yes , please ! my dear ribby ; and may i have a lump upon my nose ? " " with pleasure , my dear duchess ; how beautifully you beg ! oh , how sweetly pretty ! "
