they got amongst flower - pots , and frames and tubs ; peter heard noises worse than ever , his eyes were as big as lolly - pops ! he was a step or two in front of his cousin , when he suddenly stopped . this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner ! little benjamin took one look , and then , in half a minute less than no time , he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket .... the cat got up and stretched herself , and came and sniffed at the basket . perhaps she liked the smell of onions ! anyway , she sat down upon the top of the basket . she sat there for five hours .
