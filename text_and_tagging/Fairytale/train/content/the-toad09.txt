and she was invited to the concert in the evening -- the family concert . great enthusiasm and thin voices ; we know the sort of thing . no refreshments were given , only there was plenty to drink , for the whole pond was free . " now i shall resume my journey , " said the little toad . she always felt a longing for something better . she saw the stars shining , so large and so bright , and she saw the moon gleaming . then she saw the sun rise , and mount higher and higher . " perhaps after all , i am still in a well , only in a larger well . i must get higher yet ; i feel a great restlessness and longing . " and when the moon became round and full , the poor creature thought , " i wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down , and into which i must step to get higher up ? or is the sun the great bucket ? how great it is ! how bright it is ! it can take up all . i must look out , that i may not miss the opportunity . oh , how it seems to shine in my head ! i do n't think the jewel can shine brighter . but i have n't the jewel ; not that i cry about that -- no , i must go higher up , into splendor and joy ! i feel so confident , and yet i am afraid . it 's a difficult step to take , and yet it must be taken . onward , therefore , straight onward !
