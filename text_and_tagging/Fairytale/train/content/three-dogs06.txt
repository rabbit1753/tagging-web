now it chanced that the young swine - herd once sat in the wood blowing his flute , while his three pigs were digging under the pine - roots . and an old , old man came along , with a beard so long and so broad that it hung far below his girdle . the old man had a large , powerful dog with him . when the youth saw the great dog , he thought to himself : " if a fellow had a dog like that to keep him company here in the wilderness , he might consider himself lucky . " and when the old man noticed this , he began : " that is why i have come , for i want to exchange my dog for one of your pigs . " the youth was at once willing , and closed the bargain . he received the great dog , and gave up the gray pig in place of it . then the old man went his way . but as he left he said : " you have reason to be satisfied with our exchange , for that dog is not like other dogs . his name is ' take hold ! ' and whatever you tell him to take hold of he will seize , even though it were the grimmest of trolls . " thereupon they parted , and the youth thought that fortune had indeed favored him .
