so , about the time that she expected her husband home from work , she got out her spinning - wheel , and sat busily turning it , taking care not even to look up from her work when the man came in . for some minutes he stood with his mouth open watching her , and as she still remained silent , he said at last : ' have you gone mad , wife , that you sit spinning without anything on the wheel ? ' ' you may think that there is nothing on it , ' answered she , ' but i can assure you that there is a large skein of wool , so fine that nobody can see it , which will be woven into a coat for you . ' ' dear me ! ' he replied , ' what a clever wife i have got ! if you had not told me i should never have known that there was any wool on the wheel at all . but now i really do seem to see something . '
