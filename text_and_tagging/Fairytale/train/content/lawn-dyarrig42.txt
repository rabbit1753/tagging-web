" since you are not dead now , " said short - clothes , " there is no death allotted to you . i 'll find a way for you to leave terrible valley . go and take that old bridle hanging there beyond and shake it ; whatever beast comes and puts its head into the bridle will carry you . " lawn dyarrig shook the bridle , and a dirty , shaggy little foal came and put its head in the bridle . lawn dyarrig mounted , dropped the reins on the foal 's neck , and let him take his own choice of roads . the foal brought lawn dyarrig out by another way to the upper world , and took him to erin . lawn dyarrig stopped some distance from his father 's castle , and knocked at the house of an old weaver . " who are you ? " asked the old man . " i am a weaver , " said lawn dyarrig . " what can you do ? " " i can spin for twelve and twist for twelve . " " this is a very good man , " said the old weaver to his sons , " let us try him . " the work they had been doing for a year he had done in one hour . when dinner was over the old man began to wash and shave , and his two sons began to do the same . " why is this ? " asked lawn dyarrig . " have n't you heard that ur , son of the king , is to marry to - night the woman that he took from the green knight of terrible valley ? " " i have not , " said lawn dyarrig ; " as all are going to the wedding , i suppose i may go without offence ? " " oh , you may , " said the weaver ; " there will be a hundred thousand welcomes before you . "
