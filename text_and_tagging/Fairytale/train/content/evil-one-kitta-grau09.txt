so the merchant said : " may heaven keep me from him ! he will surely fetch me when the time comes . i have made a pact with him and i have been unable to buy anything without selling it again in three weeks ' time . " then kitta grau said : " buy me , for i am sure no one will buy me from you ! " and that is what the merchant did . he bought kitta , had her disrobe and cover herself with tar , and roll in a pile of feathers . then he put her in a glass cage as though she were a bird . now the first week went by , and the second week went by , and the third week went by , and no one appeared who wanted to buy the curious bird . and then , in due time , came the evil one , and wanted to fetch his merchant . " have patience , " said the merchant , " i still have something i have bought , but have not been able to sell again in three weeks ' time . " " that is something i 'd like to see , " said the black man . then the merchant showed him kitta grau , sitting in her glass cage . but no sooner had the evil one seen the handsome bird than he cried : " oh , i see ! it is you kitta grau ! no one who knows you would buy you ! " and with that he hurried on his way . thus kitta grau could help do evil , and help do good .
