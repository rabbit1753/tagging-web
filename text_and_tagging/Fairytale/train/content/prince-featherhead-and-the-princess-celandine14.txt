this message made a great impression upon the prince , but not so much as the portrait . he positively could not tear his eyes away from it , and exclaimed aloud that never , never had he seen anything so lovely and so graceful . then he began to think that it was too absurd that he , the fascinating featherhead , should fall in love with a portrait ; and , to drive away the recollections of its haunting eyes , he rushed back to the town ; but somehow everything seemed changed . the beauties no longer pleased him , their witty speeches had ceased to amuse ; and indeed , for their parts , they found the prince far less amiable than of yore , and were not sorry when he declared that , after all , a country life suited him best , and went back to the leafy palace .
