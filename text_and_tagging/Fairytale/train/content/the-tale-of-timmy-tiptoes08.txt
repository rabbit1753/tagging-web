now goody tiptoes had set to work again by herself . she did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker 's hole , because she had always doubted how they could be got out again . she hid them under a tree root ; they rattled down , down , down . once when goody emptied an extra big bagful , there was a decided squeak ; and next time goody brought another bagful , a little striped chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry . " it is getting perfectly full - up down - stairs ; the sitting - room is full , and they are rolling along the passage ; and my husband , chippy hackee , has run away and left me . what is the explanation of these showers of nuts ? " " i am sure i beg your pardon ; i did not not know that anybody lived here , " said mrs . goody tiptoes ; " but where is chippy hackee ? my husband , timmy tiptoes , has run away too . " " i know where chippy is ; a little bird told me , " said mrs . chippy hackee .
