when he came to the yellow river on his journey , he did what the lord of the great mountain had told him , and cried : " greencoat ! " and sure enough , a girl in green garments rose from the water , took him by the hand and told him to close his eyes . then she led him into the palace of the river - god and he delivered the letter . the river - god entertained him splendidly , and thanked him as best he knew how . at parting he said : " i am grateful that you have made this long journey to see me . i have nothing to give you , however , save this pair of green silk shoes . while you are wearing them you can keep on walking as long as you like and never grow weary . and they will give you the second sight , so that you will be able to see the spirits and gods . " the man thanked him for the gift and returned to his ship . he continued on his journey to the west , and after a year had passed , came back again . when he reached the great mountain , he thought it would be fit and proper to report to the god . so he once more knocked against the tree and gave his name . in a moment the red - clad messenger appeared and led him to the lord of the mountain . so he reported that he had delivered the letter to the river - god , and how all things were there , and the lord of the mountain thanked him . during the meal which the god had prepared for him , he withdrew for a few moments to a quiet spot . suddenly he saw his deceased father , bound and loaded with chains , who together with several hundred other criminals , was doing menial labor .
