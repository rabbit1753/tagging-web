" thank you for the last time ! " said he , " and why do you sit here so lonely and full of sorrow ? " " well , " said the prince , " i have no choice but to be sad and joyless . because of you i am a fugitive from the land of my father , and now i have not even a horse and armor to ride up the glass mountain and fight for the princess .
