" for although your brothers , " he said , " were here , they were too bashful to enter any of our lodges . they merely inquired for you and returned . you will take my daughter , treat her well , and that will bind us more closely together . " it is always the case in an assembly or gathering that some one of the number is foolish , and disposed to play the clown . it happened to be so here . one of this very sort was in the lodge , and , after maidwa had given the old chief presents , as he had to the other , this pretender jumped up in a passion , and cried out : " who is this stranger , that he should have her ? i want her myself . " the chief bade him be quiet , and not to disturb or quarrel with one who was enjoying their hospitality . " no , no , " he exclaimed , rushing forward as in act to strike . maidwa sat unmoved , and paid no heed to his threats . he cried the louder--"i will have her , i will have her ! " whereupon the old chief , being now vexed past patience , took his great war - club and tapped this clownish fellow upon the head , which so far subdued him that he sat for some time quite still ; when , after a while , he came to himself , the chief upbraided him for his folly , and told him to go out and tell stories to the old women .
