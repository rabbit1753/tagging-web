' it 's well for you , ' says saint kavin , mighty sharp--'it 's well for you , king o'toole , that you said that word , ' says he . ' for if you did n't say that word , the devil recieve the bit o ' your goose i d ever fly again , ' says saint kavin . ' oh , you need n't laugh , ' said old joe , ' for it 's truth i 'm telling you . ' well , when the king was as good as his word , saint kavin was pleased with him , and then it was that he made himself known to the king . " well , my dear , that 's the way that the place came , all at once , into the hands of saint kavin . the goose flew round every individual acre o ' king o'toole 's property , you see , bein ' let into the secret by saint kavin , who was mighty cute . so , when he done the old king out of his property for the glory of god , he was pleased with him . he and the king was the best o ' friends ever more after ( for the poor old king was doatin ' , you see ) , and the king had his goose as good as new to distract him as long as he lived . the saint supported him after he came into his property , as i told you , until the day of his death -- and that was soon afther . the poor goose thought he was catchin ' a trout one friday . but , my jewel , it was a mistake he made -- and instead of a throut , it was a thievin ' horse - eel ! and , by gor , instead of the goose killin ' a trout for the king 's supper -- by dad , the eel killed the king 's goose -- and small blame to him . but he did n't ate her , because he does n't eat what saint kavin laid his blessed hands on .
