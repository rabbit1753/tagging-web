there was much said on this head , early and late , and before very long the princess came to believe that the woman knew all there was to know about everything . so she asked her what sort of a woman the king ought to choose for a wife . the woman answered as sweet as honey : " it is not my affair to give advice in this matter ; yet he should choose for queen some one who is kind to the little princess . for one thing i know , and that is , were i fortunate enough to be chosen , my one thought would be to do all i could for the little princess , and if she wished to wash her hands , one of my daughters would have to hold the wash - bowl and the other hand her the towel . " this and much more she told the king 's daughter , and the princess believed it , as children will .
