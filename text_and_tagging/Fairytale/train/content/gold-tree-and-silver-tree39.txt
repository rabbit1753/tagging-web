" oh , what shall i do , what shall i do ? " she cried . " i see my father 's long ship coming . i know that my cruel step - mother is on board . she will try to kill me , as she tried to kill me before . oh ! come , let us escape to the hills . " " not at all , " replied the other princess , throwing her arms round the trembling gold - tree . " i am not afraid of thy lady step - mother . come with me . we will go down to the sea shore to greet her . " so they both went down to the edge of the water . when queen silver - tree saw her step - daughter coming she pretended to be very glad , and sprang out of the boat and ran to meet her . she held out a silver goblet full of wine for her to drink . " it is rare wine from the east , " she said , " and therefore very precious . i brought a flagon with me , so that we might pledge each other in a loving cup . "
