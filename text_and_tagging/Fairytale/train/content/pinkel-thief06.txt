' we are tired and hungry , and would fain have shelter for the night , ' answered the eldest brother . ' you can not get it here , ' said the witch , ' but you will find both food and shelter in the palace on the other side of the lake . take your boat and go ; but leave this boy with me - i can find work for him , though something tells me he is quick and cunning , and will do me ill . ' ' what harm can a poor boy like me do a great troll like you ? ' answered pinkel . ' let me go , i pray you , with my brothers . i will promise never to hurt you . ' and at last the witch let him go , and he followed his brothers to the boat .
