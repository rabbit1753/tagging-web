a while later came the troll with nine heads . " uff , it smells like christian blood here ! " said he , and grew very angry . " but where are the two others ? " said he . " they have not yet come home , " said the maidens . " indeed they have come , " said the troll , " but they are probably looking for the christian who has crept in here ! " at that moment , the young fellow sprang from behind the door , and struck one head after another with his bamboo cane . but he had no more than reached the eighth than it seemed to him that the troll was getting the upper hand , and he ran out of the door . the troll was so furious that he came near bursting . he seized all the maidens and killed them , and then out he flew after the young fellow . the latter had hidden behind a big rock , and when the troll came darting up , showering sparks in his rage , he struck at his ninth head , too , and the troll fell on his back , dead . then the young fellow ran in again , took his fiddle and played , and all the maidens came back to life . now they wanted to go home ; but did not know how to find the long road back . " i know what we must do , " said the young fellow , " i will take you on my back , one by one , and then the journey will not be long for us . " and this he did . he carried home all the gold and silver he found in the hill , and then celebrated his wedding with the middle one of the maidens , and if they have not died , they are living this very day .
