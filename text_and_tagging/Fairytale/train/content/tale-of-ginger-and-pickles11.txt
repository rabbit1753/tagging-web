so everybody was pleased when sally henny penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re - open the shop--"henny 's opening sale ! grand co - operative jumble ! penny 's penny prices ! come buy , come try , come buy ! " the poster really was most ticing . there was a rush upon the opening day . the shop was crammed with customers , and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters . sally henny penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change , and she insists on being paid cash ; but she is quite harmless . and she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains . there is something to please everybody .
