in the fields around the willow grew rye , wheat , and oats -- beautiful oats that , when ripe , looked like little yellow canary birds sitting on a branch . the harvest had been blessed , and the fuller the ears of grain the lower they bowed their heads in reverent humility . there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willow . the buckwheat did not bow its head , like the rest of the grain , but stood erect in stiff - necked pride .
