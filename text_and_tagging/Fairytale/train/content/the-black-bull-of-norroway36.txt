" and when he heard it , he understood it all ; and he sprang up and took her in his arms and kissed her , and asked her to tell him the whole story . and when he heard it , he was so angry with the old washerwoman and her deceitful daughter that he ordered them to leave the country at once ; and he married the little princess , and they lived happily all their days .
