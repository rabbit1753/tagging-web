as he sat up in his tree he played away on his pipes and drew the loveliest music from them . as he was playing one day a king , who had lost his way , happened to pass close by , and hearing the music he was much surprised , and sent one of his servants to find out where it came from . the man peered about , but he could see nothing but a little creature which looked like a cock with a hedgehog sitting on it , perched up in a tree . the king desired the servant to ask the strange creature why it sat there , and if it knew the shortest way to his kingdom . on this jack my hedgehog stepped down from his tree and said he would undertake to show the king his way home if the king on his part would give him his written promise to let him have whatever first met him on his return . the king thought to himself , ' that 's easy enough to promise . the creature wo n't understand a word about it , so i can just write what i choose .
