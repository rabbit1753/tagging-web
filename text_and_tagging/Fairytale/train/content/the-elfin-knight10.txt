but earl st . clair forgot that he carried a talisman which his companion lacked , that enabled him to see things as they really were , while the other 's eyes were holden , and he was startled and amazed when earl gregory said sharply , " thy mind hath gone mad over this elfin king . i tell thee he who passed was a goodly knight , clad in a green vesture , and riding on a great black jennet . and because i love a gallant horseman , and would fain learn his name and degree , i will follow him till i find him , even if it be at the world 's end . " and without another word he put spurs to his horse and galloped off in the direction which the mysterious stranger had taken , leaving earl st . clair alone upon the moorland , his fingers touching the sacred sign and his trembling lips muttering prayers for protection . for he knew that his friend had been bewitched , and he made up his mind , brave gentleman that he was , that he would follow him to the world 's end , if need be , and try to deliver him from the spell that had been cast over him .
