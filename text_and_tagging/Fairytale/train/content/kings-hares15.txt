" yes , it is a very valuable whistle , " said esben , " and i will not sell it , " but at last , as a favor to her , he said he would let her have it if she gave him two hundred dollars , and a kiss for every dollar to boot . but if she wanted to keep it , why , she must take good care of it , for that was her affair . " that is a very high price for a hare - whistle , " said the princess , and she really shrank from kissing him , " but since we are here in the middle of the forest , where no one can see or hear us , i 'll let it pass , for i positively must have the whistle , " said she . and when esben had pocketed the price agreed upon , she received the whistle , and held it tightly clutched in her hand all the way home ; yet when she reached the castle , and wanted to show it , it disappeared out of her hands . on the following day the queen herself set out , and she felt quite sure that she would succeed in coaxing the whistle away from him .
