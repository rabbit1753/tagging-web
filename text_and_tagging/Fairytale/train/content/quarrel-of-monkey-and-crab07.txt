the simple - minded crab could not resist the monkey 's clever persuasion . he at last gave in and consented to the monkey 's proposal , and the exchange was made . the greedy monkey soon gobbled up the dumpling , and with great reluctance gave up the persimmon - seed to the crab . he would have liked to keep that too , but he was afraid of making the crab angry and of being pinched by his sharp scissor - like claws . they then separated , the monkey going home to his forest trees and the crab to his stones along the river - side . as soon as the crab reached home he put the persimmon - seed in the ground as the monkey had told him .
