after some time had passed , the duke one evening heard the words : " is my master content now ? " it was lasse , though the duke could not see him . " i am well content , " answered the duke , " for you have brought me all that i have . " " but what did i get for it ? " said lasse . " nothing , " replied the duke , " but , heaven above , what was i to give you , who are not flesh and blood , and whom i can not even see , " said he . " yet if there be anything i can do for you , why let me know what it is , and i will do it . " " i would very much like to have the little scrap of paper that you keep in the box , " said lasse .
