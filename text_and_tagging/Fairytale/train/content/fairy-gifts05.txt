the fairy smiled at sylvia 's unfeigned disgust at her late experience . after allowing her a little time to recover she sent her to the court of the princess cynthia , where she left her for three months . at the end of that time sylvia came back to her with all the joy and contentment that one feels at being once more beside a dear friend . the fairy , as usual , was anxious to hear what she thought of cynthia , who had always been amiable , and to whom she had given the gift of pleasing . ' i thought at first , ' said sylvia , ' that she must be the happiest princess in the world . she had a thousand lovers who vied with one another in their efforts to please and gratify her . indeed , i had nearly decided that i would ask a similar gift . ' ' have you altered your mind , then ? ' interrupted the fairy . ' yes , indeed , madam , ' replied sylvia . ' and i will tell you why . the longer i stayed the more i saw that cynthia was not really happy . in her desire to please everyone she ceased to be sincere , and degenerated into a mere coquette . even her lovers felt that the charms and fascinations which were exercised upon all who approached her without distinction were valueless , so that in the end they ceased to care for them , and went away disdainfully . ' ' i am pleased with you , child , ' said the fairy ; ' enjoy yourself here for awhile and presently you shall go to phyllida . '
