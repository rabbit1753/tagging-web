then jack rode on in front pointing out the way , and the king reached his own country in safety . now he had an only daughter who was extremely beautiful , and who , delighted at her father 's return , ran to meet him , threw her arms round his neck and kissed him heartily . then she asked where he had been wandering so long , and he told her how he had lost his way and might never have reached home at all but for a strange creature , half - man , half - hedgehog , which rode a cock and sat up in a tree making lovely music , and which had shown him the right way . he also told her how he had been obliged to pledge his word to give the creature the first thing which met him outside his castle gate , and he felt very sad at the thought that she had been the first thing to meet him . but the princess comforted him , and said she should be quite willing to go with jack my hedgehog whenever he came to fetch her , because of the great love she bore to her dear old father .
