meanwhile earl gregory rode on and on , ever following in the wake of the knight in green , over moor , and burn , and moss , till he came to the most desolate region that he had ever been in in his life ; where the wind blew cold , as if from snow - fields , and where the hoar - frost lay thick and white on the withered grass at his feet . and there , in front of him , was a sight from which mortal man might well shrink back in awe and dread . for he saw an enormous ring marked out on the ground , inside of which the grass , instead of being withered and frozen , was lush , and rank , and green , where hundreds of shadowy elfin figures were dancing , clad in loose transparent robes of dull blue , which seemed to curl and twist round their wearers like snaky wreaths of smoke . these weird goblins were shouting and singing as they danced , and waving their arms above their heads , and throwing themselves about on the ground , for all the world as if they had gone mad ; and when they saw earl gregory halt on his horse just outside the ring they beckoned to him with their skinny fingers .
