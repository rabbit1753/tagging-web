kintaro said , " here is a place for a good game . what do you all say to a wrestling match ? " the bear being the biggest and the oldest , answered for the others : " that will be great fun , " said she . " i am the strongest animal , so i will make the platform for the wrestlers . " she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape . " all right , " said kintaro , " i will look on while you all wrestle with each other . i shall give a prize to the one who wins in each round . " " what fun ! we shall all try to get the prize , " said the bear .
