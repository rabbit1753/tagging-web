" what ! is he not solid gold ? " said the swallow to himself . he was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud . " far away , " continued the statue in a low musical voice , " far away in a little street there is a poor house . one of the windows is open , and through it i can see a woman seated at a table . her face is thin and worn , and she has coarse , red hands , all pricked by the needle , for she is a seamstress . she is embroidering passion - flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the queen 's maids - of - honour to wear at the next court - ball . in a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill . he has a fever , and is asking for oranges . his mother has nothing to give him but river water , so he is crying . swallow , swallow , little swallow , will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword - hilt ? my feet are fastened to this pedestal and i can not move .
