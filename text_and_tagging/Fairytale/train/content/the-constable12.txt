" his sentence has already been spoken , " answered the other . " this man pretended to be conscientious , and traitorously brought about the death of his friend . of all sins there is no greater sin than this . as a punishment he will be sent forth again into the world as an animal . " then he added : " when you reach home you must take constant care of your health . fate has allowed you seventy - eight years of mortal life . when your time is up i will come to fetch you myself . then i will see that you obtain a place as constable in the nether world , where we can always be together . " when he had said this , he disappeared .
