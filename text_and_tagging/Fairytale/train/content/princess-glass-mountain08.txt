when they learned at the king 's court that the wild man had broken out , there was great commotion , and the queen sent people over hill and dale to look for him . but he was gone and he stayed gone . thus matters went for a while and the queen grew more and more unhappy ; for she expected her husband to return every day . and when he did reach shore his first question was whether the wild man had been well guarded . then the queen had to confess how matters stood , and told him how everything had happened . but the king was enraged beyond measure , and said he would punish the malefactor , no matter who he might be . and he ordered a great investigation at his court , and every human being in it had to testify . but no one knew anything . at last the little prince also had to come forward . and as he stood before the king he said : " i know that i have deserved my father 's anger ; yet i can not hide the truth ; for i let out the wild man . " then the queen turned white , and the others as well , for there was not one who was not fond of the prince . at last the king spoke : " never shall it be said of me that i was false to my vow , even for the sake of my own flesh and blood ! no , you must die the death you have deserved . " and with that he gave the order to take the prince to the forest and kill him . and they were to bring back the boy 's heart as a sign that his command had been obeyed .
