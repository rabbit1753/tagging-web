bokwewa and his brother lived in a far - off part of the country . by such as had knowledge of them , bokwewa , the elder , although deformed and feeble of person , was considered a manito , who had assumed the mortal shape ; while his younger brother , kwasynd , manly in appearance , active , and strong , partook of the nature of the present race of beings . they lived off the path , in a wild , lonesome place , far retired from neighbors , and , undisturbed by cares , they passed their time , content and happy . the days glided by serenely as the river that flowed by their lodge .
