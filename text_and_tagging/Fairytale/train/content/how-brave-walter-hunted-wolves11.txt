happily jonas heard his cry of distress , for walter was quite near the mill now , and he ran and helped him up . ' what has happened ? ' he asked . ' why did walter scream so terribly ? ' ' a wolf ! a wolf ! ' cried walter , and that was all he could say . ' where is the wolf ? ' said jonas . ' i do n't see any wolf . ' ' take care , he is here , he has bitten me to death , ' groaned walter . then jonas began to laugh . yes , he laughed so that he nearly burst his skin belt . well , well , was that the wolf ? was that the wolf which walter was to take by the neck and shake and throw down on its back , no matter how much it struggled ? just look a little closer at him : he is your old friend , your own good old caro . i quite expect he found a leg of the ram in the kiln . when walter beat his drum , caro crept out , and when walter ran away , caro ran after him , as he so often does when walter wants to romp and play .
