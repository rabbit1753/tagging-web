there they stood , looking towards the bridge of thuar , in the dead of the night , with a little moonlight shining from over kilachdiarmid . at last she gave a start , and " by this and by that , " says she , " here they come , bridles jingling and feathers tossing ! " he looked , but could see nothing ; and she stood trembling and her eyes wide open , looking down the way to the ford of ballinacoola . " i see your wife , " says she , " riding on the outside just so as to rub against us . we 'll walk on quietly , as if we suspected nothing , and when we are passing i 'll give you a shove . if you do n't do your duty then , woe be with you !
