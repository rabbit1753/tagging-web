" but place yourself here , and when death comes -- i expect him every moment -- do not let him pluck the flower up , but threaten him that you will do the same with the others . then he will be afraid ! he is responsible for them to our lord , and no one dares to pluck them up before he gives leave .

" how couldst thou come quicker than i ? " " i am a mother , " said she .
