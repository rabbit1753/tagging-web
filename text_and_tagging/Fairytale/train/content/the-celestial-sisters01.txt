waupee , or the white hawk , lived in a remote part of the forest , where animals abounded . every day he returned from the chase with a large spoil , for he was one of the most skillful and lucky hunters of his tribe . his form was like the cedar . the fire of youth beamed from his eye . there was no forest too gloomy for him to penetrate , and no track made by bird or beast of any kind which he could not readily follow . one day he had gone beyond any point which he had ever before visited . he traveled through an open wood , which enabled him to see a great distance . at length he beheld a light breaking through the foliage of the distant trees , which made him sure that he was on the borders of a prairie . it was a wide plain , covered with long blue grass , and enameled with flowers of a thousand lovely tints .
