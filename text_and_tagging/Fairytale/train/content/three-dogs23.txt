and since the troll knew so well how to talk , the youth allowed himself to be beguiled by his smooth words , and forgot to be on his guard . he sat down to the table with the giant ; but the king 's daughter wept secretly , and the dogs were very restless ; though no one paid them any attention . when the giant and his guest had finished their meal , the youth said : " now that i have satisfied my hunger , give me something to quench my thirst ! " the giant replied : " on the mountain - top is a spring in which bubbles the clearest wine ; but i have no one to fetch it . " the youth answered : " if that be all that is lacking , one of my dogs can go up . " then the giant laughed in his false heart , for nothing suited him better than to have the youth send away his dogs . the youth ordered " take hold ! " to go to the spring , and the giant handed him a great tankard . the dog went ; yet it was easy to see that he did not go willingly ; and the time passed and passed and he did not return .
