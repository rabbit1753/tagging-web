" he was painfully aware that he had tried two of his charms without effect , and that he had but two more left . he now professed to be more friendly with his son - in - law than ever , and the very next day he said to owasso : " come , my son , you must go with me to procure some young eagles . we will tame them , and have them for pets about the lodge . i have discovered an island where they are in great abundance .

" now , my son , " said mishosha , " climb up this tree and bring down the birds . i think you will get some fine ones up there . " owasso obeyed . when he had with great difficulty got near the nest , mishosha cried out , addressing himself to the tree , and without much regard to the wishes of owasso : " now stretch yourself up and be very tall .
