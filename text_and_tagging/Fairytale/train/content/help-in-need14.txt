his way is marked by columns of fire and smoke ! ' the guests all grew pale with terror when they heard the news . and the princess said : ' this is the foe because of whom i have sought your aid . save me in my hour of need ! ' then she gave me two chargers , a suit of golden armor , and the insignia of a commander - in - chief , and bowed to me . i thanked her and went , called together the captains , had the army mustered and rode out before the city . at several decisive points i placed troops in ambush . the enemy was already approaching in great force , careless and unconcerned , intoxicated by his former victories . i sent out my most untrustworthy soldiers in advance , who allowed themselves to be beaten in order to lure him on . light - armed men then went out against him , and retreated in skirmish order . and thus he fell into my ambush . drums and kettledrums sounded together , the ring closed around them on all sides and the robber army suffered a grievous defeat . the dead lay about like hemp - stalks , but little tschauna succeeded in breaking through the circle .
