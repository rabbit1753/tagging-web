the crocodile , who was very simple - minded , and who had n't the least idea that the hare intended to play a trick on him , agreed to do what the hare asked . he said : " wait a little while i go back into the sea and call my company together ! " the crocodile plunged into the sea and was gone for some time . the hare , meanwhile , waited patiently on the shore . at last the crocodile appeared , bringing with him a large number of other crocodiles . " look , mr . hare ! " said the crocodile , " it is nothing for my friends to form a line between here and inaba . there are enough crocodiles to stretch from here even as far as china or india . did you ever see so many crocodiles ?
