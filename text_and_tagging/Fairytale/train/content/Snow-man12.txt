the night was long , but did not appear so to the snow man , who stood there enjoying his own reflections , and crackling with the cold . in the morning , the window - panes of the housekeeper 's room were covered with ice . they were the most beautiful ice - flowers any snow man could desire , but they concealed the stove . these window - panes would not thaw , and he could see nothing of the stove , which he pictured to himself , as if it had been a lovely human being . the snow crackled and the wind whistled around him . it was just the kind of frosty weather a snow man might thoroughly enjoy . but he did not enjoy it . how , indeed , could he enjoy anything when he was " stove sick ?
