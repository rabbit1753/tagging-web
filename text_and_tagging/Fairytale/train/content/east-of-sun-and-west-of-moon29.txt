early the next morning the north wind awakened the maiden . then he blew himself up , and made himself so large and thick that he was quite horrible to look at . thereupon they rushed along through the air as though they meant to reach the end of the world at once . and everywhere beneath them raged such a storm that forests were pulled out by the roots , and houses torn down . as they rushed across the sea , ships foundered by the hundreds . further and further they went , so far that no one could even imagine it , and still they were flying across the sea . gradually the north wind grew weary , and became weaker and weaker . finally he could hardly keep going , and sank lower and lower . at last he flew so low that the waves washed his ankles .
