the old eagle , who appeared to be the head of the tribe , was so pleased with this show of spirit that he immediately appointed two tall birds , uncommonly strong in the wings , to transport owasso to his lodge . they were to take turns in conducting him through the air . owasso expressed many obligations to the old eagle for his kindness , and they forthwith set out . it was a high point from which they started , for the pine - tree had shot far , far up toward the clouds , and they could even descry the enchanted island where the old magician lived , though it was miles and miles away . for this point they steered their flight . in a short time they landed owasso at the door of the lodge . with many compliments for their dispatch , owasso dismissed the birds , and stood ready to greet his wicked father - in - law who now arrived . when he espied his son - in - law still unharmed , mishosha grew very black in the face . he had but a single charm left .
