the children looked round wonderingly , and saw a little kind - looking old man , in a white coat and a red cap , limping out from among the bushes , for he was lame in his left foot ; neither lisa nor aina could utter a word , they were so filled with surprise . ' do n't be afraid , little girls , ' he said smiling kindly at them ; he could not laugh properly because his mouth was crooked .

' and they wanted to ask who the old man was , but were afraid to .
