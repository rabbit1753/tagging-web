the deer , the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which they were all to wrestle . when this was finished , kintaro cried out : " now begin ! the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire . now , mr . deer , you are to be umpire ! " " he , he ! " answered the deer . " i will be umpire . now , mr . monkey and mr . hare , if you are both ready , please walk out and take your places on the platform . " then the monkey and the hare both hopped out , quickly and nimbly , to the wrestling platform . the deer , as umpire , stood between the two and called out : " red - back ! red - back ! " ( this to the monkey , who has a red back in japan ) . " are you ready ? " then he turned to the hare : " long - ears ! long - ears ! are you ready ? " both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal . when he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other , crying " yoisho , yoisho ! "
