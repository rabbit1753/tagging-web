but now the time was come for sylvia to receive her gift , and all her companions were assembled . the fairy stood in the midst and in the usual manner asked what she would take with her into the great world . sylvia paused for a moment , and then answered : ' a quiet spirit . ' and the fairy granted her request . this lovely gift makes life a constant happiness to its possessor , and to all who are brought into contact with her . she has all the beauty of gentleness and contentment in her sweet face . if at times it seems less lovely through some chance grief or disquietude , the hardest thing that one ever hears said is : ' sylvia 's dear face is pale to - day . it grieves one to see her so . ' and when , on the contrary , she is gay and joyful , the sunshine of her presence rejoices all who have the happiness of being near her .
