" ah , yes , no doubt , " said the fern , " but you do not know the world yet as well as i do , for my sticks are knotty " ; and then it sang quite mournfully : " snip , snap , snurre , basse lurre . the song is ended . " " no , it is not ended , " said the flax . " to - morrow the sun will shine or the rain descend . i feel that i am growing . i feel that i am in full blossom . i am the happiest of all creatures , for i may some day come to something . "
