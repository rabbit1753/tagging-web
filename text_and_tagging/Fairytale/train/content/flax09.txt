" then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse . " after work , it is well to rest , " said the paper , " and a very good opportunity to collect one 's thoughts . now i am able , for the first time , to learn what is in me ; and to know one 's self is true progress . what will be done with me now , i wonder ? no doubt i shall still go forward . i have always progressed hitherto , i know quite well .
