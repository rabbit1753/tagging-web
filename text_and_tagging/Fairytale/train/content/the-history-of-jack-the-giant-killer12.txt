the knight and his lady thanked jack for their deliverance , and invited him to their house , to receive a proper reward for his services . " no , " said jack , " i can not be easy till i find out this monster 's habitation . " so , taking the knight 's directions , he mounted his horse and soon after came in sight of another giant , who was sitting on a block of timber waiting for his brother 's return . jack alighted from his horse , and , putting on his invisible coat , approached and aimed a blow at the giant 's head , but , missing his aim , he only cut off his nose . on this the giant seized his club and laid about him most unmercifully .
