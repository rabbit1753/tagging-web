he then told the young man to arise , and to prepare to wrestle with him . it was only by this means that he could hope to succeed in his wishes . wunzh knew how weak he was from fasting , but the voice of the stranger was cheery , and put such a courage in his heart , that he promptly sprang up , determined to die rather than fail . brave wunzh ! if you ever accomplish any thing , it will be through the power of the resolve that spoke within you at that moment . he began the trial , and after a long - sustained struggle he was almost overpowered , when the beautiful stranger said : " my friend , it is enough for once , i will come again to try you ; " and smiling on him , he returned through the air in the same direction in which he had come . the next day , although he saw how sweetly the wild - flowers bloomed upon the slopes , and the birds warbled from the woodland , he longed to see the celestial visitor , and to hear his voice . to his great joy he reappeared at the same hour , toward the going down of the sun , and re - challenged wunzh to a trial of strength .
