long , long ago there lived in kyoto a brave soldier named kintoki . now he fell in love with a beautiful lady and married her . not long after this , through the malice of some of his friends , he fell into disgrace at court and was dismissed . this misfortune so preyed upon his mind that he did not long survive his dismissal . he died , leaving behind him his beautiful young wife to face the world alone . fearing her husband 's enemies , she fled to the ashigara mountains as soon as her husband was dead . there in the lonely forests where no one ever came except woodcutters , a little boy was born to her . she called him kintaro or the golden boy . now the remarkable thing about this child was his great strength , and as he grew older he grew stronger and stronger . by the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as quickly as the woodcutters . then his mother gave him a large ax , and he used to go out in the forest and help the woodcutters , who called him " wonder - child , " and his mother the " old nurse of the mountains , " for they did not know her high rank . another favorite pastime of kintaro 's was to smash up rocks and stones . you can imagine how strong he was !
