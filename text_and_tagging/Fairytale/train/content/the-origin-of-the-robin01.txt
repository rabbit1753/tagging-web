an old man had an only son , named iadilla , who had come to that age which is thought to be most proper to make the long and final fast which is to secure through life a guardian genius or spirit . the father was ambitious that his son should surpass all others in whatever was deemed wisest and greatest among his people . to accomplish his wish , he thought it necessary that the young iadilla should fast a much longer time than any of those renowned for their power or wisdom , whose fame he coveted . he therefore directed his son to prepare with great ceremony for the important event . after he had been several times in the sweating - lodge and bath , which were to prepare and purify him for communion with his good spirit , he ordered him to lie down upon a clean mat in a little lodge expressly provided for him . he enjoined upon him at the same time to endure his fast like a man , and promised that at the expiration of twelve days he should receive food and the blessing of his father .
