then the whole company of crocodiles arranged themselves in the water so as to form a bridge between the island of oki and the mainland of inaba . when the hare saw the bridge of crocodiles , he said : " how splendid ! i did not believe this was possible . now let me count you all ! to do this , however , with your permission , i must walk over on your backs to the other side . please be so good as not to move , or else i shall fall into the sea and be drowned ! " so the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles , counting as he jumped from one crocodile 's back to the other : " please keep quite still , or i shall not be able to count . one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine- " thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of inaba . not content with getting his wish , he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them . he said , as he leapt off the last one 's back : " oh ! you stupid crocodiles , now i have done with you !
