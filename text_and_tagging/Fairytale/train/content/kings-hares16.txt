she was stingier , and only offered fifty dollars ; but she had to raise her bid until she reached three hundred . esben said it was a magnificent whistle , and that the price was a beggarly one ; but seeing that she was the queen , he would let it pass . she was to pay him three hundred dollars , and for every dollar she was to give him a buss to boot , then she should have the whistle . and he was paid in full as agreed , since as regards the busses the queen was not so stingy . when she had the whistle in her hands , she tied it fast , and hid it well , but she fared not a whit better than either of the others . when she wanted to show the whistle it was gone , and in the evening esben came home , driving his hares as though they were a well - trained flock of sheep .
