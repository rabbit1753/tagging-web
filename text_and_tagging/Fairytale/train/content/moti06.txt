' now , ' said the king to moti , ' guess ! ' it happened that when the king had opened the door behind him , moti noticed that there was a garden outside : without waiting for the king 's return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small enough to be shut in the box . ' is it likely to be a fruit or a flower ? no , not a flower this time , for he clasped it too tight . then it must be a fruit or a stone . yet not a stone , because he would n't wrap a dirty stone in his nice clean cloth . then it is a fruit ! and a fruit without much scent , or else he would be afraid that i might smell it . now what fruit without much scent is in season just now ? when i know that i shall have guessed the riddle ! ' as has been said before , moti was a country lad , and was accustomed to work in his father 's garden . he knew all the common fruits , so he thought he ought to be able to guess right ; but so as not to let it seem too easy , he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression , and looked down at the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed against his forehead , and then he said , slowly , with his eyes on the king,-- ' it is freshly plucked ! it is round and it is red ! it is a pomegranate !
