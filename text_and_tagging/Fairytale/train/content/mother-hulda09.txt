but she answered , " that is all very fine ; suppose one of you should fall on my head , " and went on farther . when she came to mother hulda 's house she did not feel afraid , as she knew beforehand of her great teeth , and entered into her service at once . the first day she put her hand well to the work , and was industrious , and did everything mother hulda bade her , because of the gold she expected ; but the second day she began to be idle , and the third day still more so , so that she would not get up in the morning . neither did she make mother hulda 's bed as it ought to have been made , and did not shake it for the feathers to fly about . so that mother hulda soon grew tired of her , and gave her warning , at which the lazy thing was well pleased , and thought that now the shower of gold was coming ; so mother hulda led her to the door , and as she stood in the doorway , instead of the shower of gold a great kettle full of pitch was emptied over her . " that is the reward for your service , " said mother hulda , and shut the door . so the lazy girl came home all covered with pitch , and the cock on the top of the well seeing her , cried , " cock - a - doodle doo ! our dirty girl has come home too ! " and the pitch remained sticking to her fast , and never , as long as she lived , could it be got off .
