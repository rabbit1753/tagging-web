we flew , and we flew , and we flew , until we came right over the wide ocean . i knew it well , for i saw cape clear to my right hand , sticking up out of the water . ' ah , my lord , ' said i to the goose , for i thought it best to keep a civil tongue in my head anyway , ' fly to land , if you please . ' ' it is impossible , you see , dan , ' said he , ' for a while , because , you see , we are going to arabia . ' ' to arabia ! ' said i , ' that 's surely some place in foreign parts , far away . oh ! mr . goose , why , then , to be sure , i 'm a man to be pitied among you . ' ' whist , whist , you fool , ' said he , ' hold your tongue ; i tell you arabia is a very decent sort of place , as like west carbery as one egg is like another , only there is a little more sand there . ' just as we were talking a ship hove in sight , sailing so beautiful before the wind . ' ah , then , sir , ' said i , ' will you drop me on the ship , if you please ? ' ' we are not fair over it , ' said he ; ' if i dropped you now you would go splash into the sea . ' ' i would not , ' says i , ' i know better than that , for it is just clean under us , so let me drop now at once . '
