they left a great many odd little foot - marks all over the bed , especially little benjamin , who was wearing clogs . little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter 's clothes , in order that they might be able to use the pocket handkerchief . they took them off the scarecrow . there had been rain during the night ; there was water in the shoes , and the coat was somewhat shrunk . benjamin tried on the tam - o - shanter , but it was too big for him . then he suggested that they should fill the pocket - handkerchief with onions , as a little present for his aunt . peter did not seem to be enjoying himself ; he kept hearing noises .
