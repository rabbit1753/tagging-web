now the poor labourer was but a clumsy dancer , and he held back with a shamefaced air . but the fairy who had been chosen to be his partner reached up and seized his hands , and lo ! some strange magic seemed to enter into his veins . for in a moment he found himself waltzing and whirling , sliding and bowing , as if he had done nothing else but dance all his life . and , strangest thing of all ! he forgot about his home and his children . he felt so happy that he had no longer the slightest desire to leave the fairies ' company . all night long the merriment went on . the little folk danced and danced as if they were mad , and the farm man danced with them , until at last a shrill sound came over the moor . it was the cock from the farmyard crowing its loudest to welcome the dawn .
