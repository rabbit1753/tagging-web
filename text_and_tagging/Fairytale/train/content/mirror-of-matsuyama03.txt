so the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey , knowing what an arduous task lay before him . vainly she wished that she could accompany him , but the distance was too great for the mother and child to go , and besides that , it was the wife 's duty to take care of the home . all was ready at last , and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him . " do not be anxious , i will come back soon , " said the man . " while i am away take care of everything , and especially of our little daughter . " " yes , we shall be all right - but you - you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in coming back to us , " said the wife , while the tears fell like rain from her eyes . the little girl was the only one to smile , for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting . she did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village , which her father did very often . she ran to his side , and caught hold of his long sleeve to keep him a moment .
