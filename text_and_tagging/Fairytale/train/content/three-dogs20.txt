while they were still talking together , the giant came riding on his steed shod with gold , and drew up outside the mountain . when he noticed that the great door was open , he grew furiously angry , and shouted till the mountain trembled to its very roots . he said : " who has broken my mountain door ? " the youth boldly answered : " i have , and now i shall break you as well ! ' take hold , ' seize him ! ' tear ! ' and ' hark ! ' tear him into a thousand pieces ! " the dogs at once rushed up , threw themselves upon the giant , and tore him into as many pieces as leaves fall in the autumn . then the king 's daughter was happy beyond measure and cried : " god be praised , now i am freed ! " and she fell upon the youth 's neck and gave him a kiss . but he led the princess to her sister , and one can imagine - how glad they were to see each other again . then the youth packed up all the treasures he found in the mountain hall , loaded them on the giant 's steed , and went his way with the king 's two daughters . and they wandered along for a long time .
