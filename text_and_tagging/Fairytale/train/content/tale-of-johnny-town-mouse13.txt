the gardener left the hamper by the garden gate , so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed . timmy willie crept in through a hole in the wicker - work , and after eating some peas - timmy willie fell fast asleep . he awoke in a fright , while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier 's cart . then there was a jolting , and a clattering of horse 's feet ; other packages were thrown in ; for miles and miles - jolt - jolt - jolt ! and timmy willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables .
