the old woman looked at her suspiciously . " the two are one , " she answered ; " for the black knight chanced to have a spell thrown over him , which turned him into a black bull , and which could not be lifted until he had fought with , and overcome , a mighty spirit of evil that lived in a dark glen . he fought with the spirit , and overcame it and once more regained his true form ; but it is said that his mind is somewhat clouded at times , for he speaketh ever of a maiden whom he would fain have wedded , and whom he hath lost . though who , or what she was , no living person kens . but this story can have no interest to a stranger like thee , " she added slowly , as if she were sorry for having said so much . " i have no more time to waste in talking . but if thou wilt try and wash the mantle , thou art welcome to a night 's lodging ; and if not , i must ask thee to go on thy way . " needless to say , the princess said that she would try to wash the mantle ; and it seemed as if her fingers had some magic power in them , for as soon as she put it into water the stains vanished , and it became as white and clean as when it was new . of course , the old woman was delighted , but she was very suspicious also , for it appeared to her that there must be some mysterious link between the maiden and the knight , if his mantle became clean so easily when she washed it , when it had remained soiled and stained in spite of all the labour which she and her daughter had bestowed upon it .
