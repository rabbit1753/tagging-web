" you must think it strange that i want to go away , " said momotaro , " because i have not yet told you my reason . far away from here to the northeast of japan there is an island in the sea . this island is the stronghold of a band of devils . i have often heard how they invade this land , kill and rob the people , and carry off all they can find . they are not only very wicked but they are disloyal to our emperor and disobey his laws . they are also cannibals , for they kill and eat some of the poor people who are so unfortunate as to fall into their hands . these devils are very hateful beings . i must go and conquer them and bring back all the plunder of which they have robbed this land . it is for this reason that i want to go away for a short time ! " as the wind blew in their favor and they met no storms the ship made a quick voyage , and one day when the sun was shining brightly a sight of land rewarded the four watchers at the bow .
