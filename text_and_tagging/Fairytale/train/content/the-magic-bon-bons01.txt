there lived in boston a wise and ancient chemist by the name of dr . daws , who dabbled somewhat in magic . there also lived in boston a young lady by the name of claribel sudds , who was possessed of much money , little wit and an intense desire to go upon the stage . so claribel went to dr . daws and said : " i can neither sing nor dance ; i can not recite verse nor play upon the piano ; i am no acrobat nor leaper nor high kicker ; yet i wish to go upon the stage . what shall i do ? " " are you willing to pay for such accomplishments ? " asked the wise chemist . " certainly , " answered claribel , jingling her purse . " then come to me to - morrow at two o'clock , " said he .
