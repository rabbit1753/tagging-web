old mr . bunny had no opinion whatever of cats . he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat , and cuffed it off the basket , and kicked it into the garden - house , scratching off a handful of fur . the cat was too much surprised to scratch back . when old mr . bunny had driven the cat into the green - house , he locked the door . then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears , and whipped him with the little switch . then he took out his nephew peter . then he took out the handkerchief of onions , and marched out of the garden .
