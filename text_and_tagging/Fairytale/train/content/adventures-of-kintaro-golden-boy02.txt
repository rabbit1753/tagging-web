quite unlike other boys , kintaro , grew up all alone in the mountain wilds . as he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk . by degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon kintaro as their master , and he used them as his servants and messengers . but his special retainers were the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare .
