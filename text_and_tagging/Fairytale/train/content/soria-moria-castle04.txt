in the castle there was a fire on the hearth , and halvor went into the kitchen , which was beautiful . the kitchenware was all of silver and gold ; but there were no human beings to be seen . after halvor had waited a while , and no one came out , he went and opened a door . there he saw a princess sitting and spinning . " alas , no ! " cried she . " has a christian soul really come here ! but it would be best for you to go again , if you do not want the troll to swallow you ; for a troll with three heads lives here . "
