for many days with this intention i have waited on the bridge in the shape of the horrible serpent - dragon that you saw , in the hope that some strong brave man would come along . but all who came this way , as soon as they saw me were terrified and ran away as fast as they could . you are the first man i have found able to look at me without fear , so i knew at once that you were a man of great courage . i beg you to have pity upon me . will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede ?
