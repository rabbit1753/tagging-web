" i will wait with you one night longer , " said the swallow , who really had a good heart . " shall i take him another ruby ? " " alas ! i have no ruby now , " said the prince ; " my eyes are all that i have left . they are made of rare sapphires , which were brought out of india a thousand years ago . pluck out one of them and take it to him . he will sell it to the jeweller , and buy food and firewood , and finish his play . " " dear prince , " said the swallow , " i can not do that " ; and he began to weep . " swallow , swallow , little swallow , " said the prince , " do as i command you . " so the swallow plucked out the prince 's eye , and flew away to the student 's garret . it was easy enough to get in , as there was a hole in the roof . through this he darted , and came into the room . the young man had his head buried in his hands , so he did not hear the flutter of the bird 's wings , and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets .
