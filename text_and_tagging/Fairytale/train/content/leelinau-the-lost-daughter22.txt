" i am going , " she continued , addressing her mother as they left the lodge , " i am going from one who has watched my infancy and guarded my youth ; who has given me medicine when i was sick , and prepared my food when i was well . i am going from a father who has ranged the forest to procure the choicest skins for my dress , and kept his lodge supplied with the best spoil of the chase . i am going from a lodge which has been my shelter from the storms of winter , and my shield from the heats of summer . farewell , my parents , farewell ! " so saying , she sped faster than any could follow her to the margin of the fairy wood , and in a moment was lost to sight . as she had often thus withdrawn herself from the lodge , the parents were not in fear , but confidently awaited her return . hour chased hour , as the clouds of evening rolled up in the west ; darkness came on , but no daughter returned . with torches they hastened to the wood , and although they lit up every dark recess and leafy gloom , their search was in vain . leelinau was nowhere to be seen . they called aloud , in lament , upon her name , but she answered not . suns rose and set , but nevermore in their light did the bereaved parents eyes behold the lost form of their beloved child . their daughter was lost indeed . whither she had vanished no mortal tongue could tell ; although it chanced that a company of fishermen , who were spearing fish near the spirit grove , descried something that seemed to resemble a female figure standing on the shore . as the evening was mild and the waters calm , they cautiously pulled their canoe toward land , but the slight ripple of their oars excited alarm . the figure fled in haste , but they could recognize in the shape and dress as she ascended the bank , the lost daughter , and they saw the green plumes of her fairy - lover waving over his forehead as he glided lightly through the forest of young pines .
