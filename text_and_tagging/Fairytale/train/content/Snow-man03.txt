" you know nothing at all , " replied the yard - dog ; " but then , you 've only lately been patched up . what you see yonder is the moon , and the one before it was the sun . it will come again to - morrow , and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well . i think the weather is going to change . i can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg . i am sure there is going to be a change . " " i do n't understand him , " said the snow man to himself . " but i have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable . the one who stared so just now , and whom he calls the sun , is not my friend ; i can feel that too . " " away , away , " barked the yard - dog , and then he turned round three times , and crept into his kennel to sleep .
