it happened on the same day , that his elder brother , owasso , was fishing in his magic canoe , a considerable distance out upon the lake . he thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore . he wondered how any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast . he listened again with all attention , and he heard the cry distinctly repeated . this time it was the well - known cry of his younger brother that reached his ear . he knew too well the secret of his song , as he heard him chaunting mournfully : " my brother ! my brother ! since you left me going in the canoe , a - hee - ee , i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee . i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee . " owasso made for the shore , and as he approached the lament was repeated . the sounds were very distinct , and the voice of wailing was very sorrowful for owasso to listen to . it touched him the more that it died away at the close , into a long - drawn howl , like that of the wolf .
