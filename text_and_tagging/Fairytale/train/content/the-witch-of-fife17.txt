but he was a sly old man , and the thought of the bishop 's wine gave him no rest . so night after night he went and hid in the old woman 's cottage , in the hope that his wife and her friends would meet there ; and although for a long time it was all in vain , at last his trouble was rewarded . for one evening the whole five old women assembled , and in low tones and with chuckles of laughter they recounted all that had befallen them in lappland . then , running to the fireplace , they , one after another , climbed on a chair and put their feet on the sooty crook . then they repeated the magic words , and , hey , presto ! they were up the lum and away before the old man could draw his breath . " i can do that , too , " he said to himself ; and he crawled out of his hiding - place and ran to the fire . he put his foot on the crook and repeated the words , and up the chimney he went , and flew through the air after his wife and her companions , as if he had been a warlock born . and , as witches are not in the habit of looking over their shoulders , they never noticed that he was following them , until they reached the bishop 's palace and went down into his cellar , then , when they found that he was among them , they were not too well pleased . however , there was no help for it , and they settled down to enjoy themselves . they tapped this cask of wine , and they tapped that , drinking a little of each , but not too much ; for they were cautious old women , and they knew that if they wanted to get home before cock - crow it behoved them to keep their heads clear . but the old man was not so wise , for he sipped , and he sipped , until at last he became quite drowsy , and lay down on the floor and fell fast asleep .
