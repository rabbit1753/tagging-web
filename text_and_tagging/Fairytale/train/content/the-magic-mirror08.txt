but the king was still much troubled , fearing the loss of sipao , for the mirror had magic powers , so that he who owned it had but to ask and his wish would be fulfilled ; to it insato owed all that he possessed . as soon as the king left him , gopani - kufa again took zengi - mizi , out of his basket . ' zengi - mizi , ' he said , ' the king seems loth to grant my request for the mirror -- is there not some other thing of equal value for which i might ask ? ' and the wasp answered : ' there is nothing in the world , o gopani - kufa , which is of such value as this mirror , for it is a wishing mirror , and accomplishes the desires of him who owns it . if the king hesitates , go to him the next day , and the day after , and in the end he will bestow the mirror upon you , for you saved his life .
