the other princesses were much surprised to hear this , and did not stop prying and questioning , and their sister answered all their questions faithfully . when they heard how splendidly she lived in the great castle , they grew jealous because she was so much better off than they were . and they insisted on knowing whether there was not some one little thing of which she could complain . " no , " said the king 's daughter , " i can only praise my husband for his kindness and amiability , and there is but one thing lacking to make me perfectly happy . " " what is it ? " " what is it ? " cried both sisters with a single voice . " every night , when he comes home , " said the princess , " he turns into a human being , and i am sorry that i can never see what he really looks like . " then both sisters again with one voice , began to scold the dog loudly ; because he had a secret which he kept from his wife . and since her sisters now continually spoke about it , her own curiosity awoke once more , she forgot her husband 's command , and asked how she might manage to see him without his knowing it . " o , " said the oldest princess , " nothing easier ! here is a little lamp , which you must hide carefully . then you need only get up at night when he is asleep , and light the lamp in order to see him in his true shape . " this advice seemed good to the king 's daughter ; she took the lamp , hid it in her breast , and promised to do all that her sisters had counseled .
