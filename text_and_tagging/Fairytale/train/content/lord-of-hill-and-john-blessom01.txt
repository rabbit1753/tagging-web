john blessom once upon a time had gone down to copenhagen to carry on a suit at law , for in those days one could not get justice in the land of norroway ; and if a man wanted his rights , there was nothing left for him to do but to travel to copenhagen . this is what blessom had done , and what his son did after him , for he , too , carried on a law - suit . now it chanced that on christmas eve john had had speech with the gentleman in authority , and had attended to his business , and was going along the street in a low - spirited manner , for he was homesick . and as he went along , a man from vaage , in a white blouse , with a knapsack , and buttons as big as silver dollars , passed him . he was a large , heavily - built man . it seemed to blessom that he must know him ; but he was walking very fast .
