in the morning the wild - duck flew up and caught sight of their new comrade . " what sort of a chap are you ? " they asked ; and the duckling turned to this side and that and greeted them as well as he could . " you 're precious ugly , " said the wild - ducks ; " but that does n't matter to us as long as you do n't marry into our family . " poor wretch ! he was n't thinking much about marrying , as long as he could be allowed to lie among the reeds , and drink a little marsh water . there he lay two whole days , and then came a pair of wild geese ( or rather wild ganders , for they were both he 's ) : they had n't been hatched out very long , and so they were particularly lively . " here , mate , " they said , " you 're so ugly i quite like you . will you come along and be a migrant ? close by in another marsh there 's some sweet pretty wild geese -- all young ladies that can say quack . you 're so ugly you could make your fortune with them .
