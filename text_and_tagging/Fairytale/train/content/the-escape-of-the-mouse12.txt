' what craft wilt thou follow ? ' asked kieva as they went along . ' i shall make shoes as once i did , ' replied he . he got all the finest leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes , till everyone flocked to buy . all the shoemakers in the town were idle and banded together in anger to kill him . but luckily manawyddan got word of it . he and kieva left the town one night and proceeded to narberth . he took with him a sheaf of wheat , which he sowed in three plots of ground . and while the wheat was growing up , he hunted and fished . they had food enough and to spare . thus the months passed until the harvest . one evening manawyddan visited the furthest of his fields of wheat ; and saw that it was ripe .
