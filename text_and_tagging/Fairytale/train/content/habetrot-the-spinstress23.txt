it was now late , and maisie lost no time in running home with the precious thread upon her shoulder . when she walked into the kitchen she found that her mother had gone to bed . she seemed to have had a busy day , for there , hanging up in the wide chimney , in order to dry , were seven large black puddings . the fire was low , but bright and clear ; and the sight of it and the sight of the puddings suggested to maisie that she was very hungry , and that fried black puddings were very good . flinging the thread down on the table , she hastily pulled off her shoes , so as not to make a noise and awake her mother ; and , getting down the frying - pan from the wall , she took one of the black puddings from the chimney , and fried it , and ate it . still she felt hungry , so she took another , and then another , till they were all gone . then she crept upstairs to her little bed and fell fast asleep .
