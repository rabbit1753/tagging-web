wunzh now returned to his father 's lodge , where he was warmly welcomed . as it had been appointed to him during the days of his fasting to walk apart with heaven , he was not permitted to see any human face save that of his father , the representative to the little household upon earth of the good father who is in heaven . wunzh partook sparingly of the meal that had been prepared for him , and once more mingled in the cares and sports of the family . but he never for a moment forgot the grave of his friend . he carefully visited it throughout the spring , and weeded out the grass , and kept the ground in a soft and pliant state . sometimes , when the brave wunzh thought of his friend that was gone from his sight , he dropped a tear upon the earth where he lay . watching and tending , and moistening the earth with his tears , it was not long before wunzh saw the tops of green plumes coming through the ground . the more faithful he was in obeying his instructions in keeping the ground in order , and in cherishing the memory of his departed friend , the faster they grew . he was , however , careful to conceal the charge of the earth which he had from his father . days and weeks had passed in this way . the summer was drawing toward a close , when one day , after a long absence in hunting , wunzh invited his father to follow him to the quiet and lonesome spot of his former fast .
