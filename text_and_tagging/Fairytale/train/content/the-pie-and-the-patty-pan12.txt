" my great - aunt squintina ( grandmother of cousin tabitha twitchit)--died of a thimble in a christmas plum - pudding . _ i _ never put any article of metal in my puddings or pies . " duchess looked aghast , and tilted up the pie - dish . " i have only four patty - pans , and they are all in the cupboard . " duchess set up a howl . " i shall die ! i shall die ! i have swallowed a patty - pan ! oh , my dear ribby , i do feel so ill ! " " it is impossible , my dear duchess ; there was not a patty - pan . " duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about . " oh i feel so dreadful . i have swallowed a patty - pan ! " " there was nothing in the pie , " said ribby severely . " yes there was , my dear ribby , i am sure i have swallowed it ! " " let me prop you up with a pillow , my dear duchess ; where do you think you feel it ? " " oh i do feel so ill all over me , my dear ribby ; i have swallowed a large tin patty - pan with a sharp scalloped edge ! " " shall i run for the doctor ? i will just lock up the spoons ! " " oh yes , yes ! fetch dr . maggotty , my dear ribby : he is a pie himself , he will certainly understand . "
