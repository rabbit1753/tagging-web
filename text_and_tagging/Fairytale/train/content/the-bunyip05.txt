' let it go ! let it go ! ' whispered the young men to each other ; but the captor declared that he had caught it , and was going to keep it . ' he had promised his sweetheart , ' he said , ' that he would bring back enough meat for her father 's house to feast on for three days , and though they could not eat the little bunyip , her brothers and sisters should have it to play with . ' so , flinging his spear at the mother to keep her back , he threw the little bunyip on to his shoulders , and set out for the camp , never heeding the poor mother 's cries of distress .
