" does a stove look beautiful ? " asked the snow man , " is it at all like me ? " " it is just the reverse of you , " said the dog ; " it 's as black as a crow , and has a long neck and a brass knob . it eats firewood , so that fire spurts out of its mouth . we should keep on one side , or under it , to be comfortable . you can see it through the window , from where you stand . " then the snow man looked , and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob , and fire gleaming from the lower part of it . the snow man felt quite a strange sensation come over him . it was very odd , he knew not what it meant , and he could not account for it . but there are people who are not men of snow , who understand what it is . " and why did you leave her ? " asked the snow man , for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex . " how could you give up such a comfortable place ? "
