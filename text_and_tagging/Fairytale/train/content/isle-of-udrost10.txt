isaac 's share was laid down in the forepart of the boat ; and he himself took down the fish from the stands ; yet he could not understand how it was that the stands were continually filled with fresh fish , no matter how many he took away , and when he sailed away they were still as full as ever . when he reached bergen , he sold his fish , and got so much money for them that he was able to buy a new schooner , completely fitted out , and with a cargo to boot , as the man of udrost had advised him . late in the evening , when he was about to sail for home , the man came aboard and told him never to forget those who survived his neighbor , for his neighbor himself had died . then he wished isaac all possible success and good fortune for his schooner , in advance . " all is well , and all stands firm that towers in the air , " said he , and what he meant was that there was one aboard whom none could see , but who would support the mast on his back , if need be .
