now they wanted to go home to the father of the king 's son ; but he would not hear of the master girl 's going afoot , since he did not think this fitting for either of them . " wait here a little while , until i fetch the seven horses that stand in my father 's stable , " said the king 's son . " it is not far , and i will soon be back ; for i will not have my bride come marching home afoot . " " no , do not do so , for when you get home to the castle you will forget me , i know that positively , " said the master girl . " how could i forget you ? " said the king 's son . " we have passed through so many hardships together , and we love each other so dearly , " said he . he wanted to fetch the coach and seven horses at all costs , and she was to wait by the seashore . so at last the master girl had to give in . " but when you get there , you must not take time to greet a single person . you must at once go to the stable , harness the horses , and drive back as swiftly as you can . they will all come to meet you , but you must act as though you did not see them , and must not take a single bite to eat . if you do not do that , you will make both of us unhappy , " said she . and he promised to do as she had said .
