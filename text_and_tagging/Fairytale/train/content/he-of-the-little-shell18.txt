" presently the man , who proved to be no less a personage than the celebrated giant , manabozho , looked up and saw him . after regarding him with attention , " who are you , little man ? " said manabozho . " i have a mind to kill you . " the little hero of the shell replied : " if you were to try to kill me you could not do it . " with this speech of the little man , manabozho grabbed at him ; but when he thought to have had him in his hand , he was gone . " where are you now , little man ? " cried manabozho . " here , under your girdle , " answered the shell - dwarf ; at which giant manabozho , thinking to crush him , slapped down his great hand with all his might ; but on unloosing his girdle he was disappointed at finding no dwarf there . " where are you now , little man ? " he cried again , in a greater rage than ever . " in your right nostril ! " the dwarf replied ; whereupon the giant manabozho seized himself by the finger and thumb at the place , and gave it a violent tweak ; but as he immediately heard the voice of the dwarf at a distance upon the ground , he was satisfied that he had only pulled his own nose to no purpose .
