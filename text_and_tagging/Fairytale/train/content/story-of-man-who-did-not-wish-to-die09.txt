" i should like to live , " he said to himself , " till i am five or six hundred years old at least , free from all sickness . the ordinary span of a man 's life is very short . " he wondered whether it were possible , by living simply and frugally henceforth , to prolong his life as long as he wished . he knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years . there was a princess of yamato , who , it was said , lived to the age of five hundred . this was the latest story of a very long life record . the emperor ordered jofuku to set out for the land of horaizan , to find the hermits , and to bring him back a phial of the magic elixir . he gave jofuku one of his best junks , fitted it out for him , and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for jofuku to take as presents to the hermits . jofuku sailed for the land of horaizan , but he never returned to the waiting emperor . but ever since that time mount fuji has been said to be the fabled horaizan and the home of hermits who had the secret of the elixir . it has been said that jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god .
