in autumn the swallows fly away to foreign lands ; but there are some who are late in starting , and then they get so cold that they drop down as if dead , and the snow comes and covers them over . thumbelina trembled , she was so frightened ; for the bird was very large in comparison with herself - only an inch high . but she took courage , piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow , fetched her own coverlid and laid it over his head . next night she crept out again to him . there he was alive , but very weak ; he could only open his eyes for a moment and look at thumbelina , who was standing in front of him with a piece of rotten wood in her hand , for she had no other lantern .
