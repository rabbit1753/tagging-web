" i deserved the first prize , and not the second , " said the snail . " i know so much , at least , that the hare only ran from cowardice , and because he thought there was danger in delay . i , on the other hand , made running the business of my life , and have become a cripple in the service . if any one had a first prize , it ought to have been myself . but i do not understand chattering and boasting ; on the contrary , i despise it . " and the snail spat at them with contempt .
