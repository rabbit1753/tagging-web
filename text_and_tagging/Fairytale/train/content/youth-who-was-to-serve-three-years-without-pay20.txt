" do not do so on any account , " said the cat . " you will get your ring again . " " yes , if that were so , then ... " said the youth . the cat ran away . suddenly a rat crossed her path . " now i will pounce on you ! " said the cat . " o do not do that , " said the rat , " you shall have the ring again ! " " well , if that is so , then ... " said the cat . when the folk at the castle had gone to bed , the rat crept around , and sniffed and spied out the room of the prince and princess ; and at last he found a little hole through which he crawled . then he heard the prince and princess talking to each other , and saw that the prince was wearing the ring on his finger . before she went , the princess said : " good night . and see that you take good care of the ring , my dearest ! " " pooh ! no one will come in through the walls for the sake of a ring , " said the prince , " but if you think it is not safe enough on my hand , why , i can put it in my mouth . "
