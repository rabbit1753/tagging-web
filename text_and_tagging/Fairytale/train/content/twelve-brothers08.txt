the girl asked , sobbing : ' is there no means of setting them free ? ' ' no , ' said the old woman , ' there is only one way in the whole world , and that is so difficult that you wo n't free them by it , for you would have to be dumb and not laugh for seven years , and if you spoke a single word , though but an hour were wanting to the time , your silence would all have been in vain , and that one word would slay your brothers . ' then the girl said to herself : ' if that is all i am quite sure i can free my brothers . ' so she searched for a high tree , and when she had found one she climbed up it and spun all day long , never laughing or speaking one word .
