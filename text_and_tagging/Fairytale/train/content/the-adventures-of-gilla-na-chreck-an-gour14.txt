long ago a poor widow woman lived down by the iron forge near enniscorthy , and she was so poor , she had no clothes to put on her son . so , she used to fix him in the ash - hole , near the fire , and pile the warm ashes about him . accordingly , as he grew up , she sunk the pit deeper . at last , by hook or by crook , she got a goat - skin , and fastened it round his waist , and he felt quite grand , and took a walk down the street . so says she to him next morning , " tom , you thief , you never done any good yet , and six - foot high , and past nineteen . take that rope and bring me a bresna from the wood . " " never say't twice , mother , " says tom ; " here goes . " when he had it gathered and tied , what should come up but a big joiant , nine - foot high , and made a lick of a club at him . well become tom , he jumped a - one side and picked up a ram - pike . the first crack he gave the big fellow he made him kiss the clod . " if you have e'er a prayer , " says tom , " now 's the time to say it , before i make brishe of you . " " i have no prayers , " says the giant , " but if you spare my life i 'll give you that club . as long as you keep from sin you 'll win every battle you ever fight with it . " tom made no bones about letting him off . as soon as he got the club in his hands he sat down on the bresna and gave it a tap with the kippeen , and says , " bresna , i had a great trouble gathering you , and run the risk of my life for you . the least you can do is to carry me home . " and , sure enough , the wind of the word was all it wanted . it went off through the wood , groaning and cracking till it came to the widow 's door .
