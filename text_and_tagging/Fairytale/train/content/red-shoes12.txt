" now , i have suffered enough for the red shoes , " she said ; " i will go to church , so that people can see me . " and she went quickly up to the church - door ; but when she came there , the red shoes were dancing before her , and she was frightened , and turned back . during the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears , but when sunday came again she said : " now i have suffered and striven enough . i believe i am quite as good as many of those who sit in church and give themselves airs . " and so she went boldly on ; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her . then she became terrified , and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin .
