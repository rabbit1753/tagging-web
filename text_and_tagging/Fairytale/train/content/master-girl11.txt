in a short time he came to the sea , and could not cross . " but i know how to help myself , " said ahe . " i will fetch my sea - sucker . " so the sea - sucker came , and lay down and took two or three swallows , and thus lowered the water so that the giant could see the king 's son and the master girl out on the ship . " now you must throw the lick - stone overboard , " said the master girl , and the king 's son did so . it turned into a tremendous large rock square across the sea , and the giant could not get over , and the sea - sucker could drink up no more of the sea . " i know quite well what i must do , " said the giant . " i must now fetch my hill - borer . " so the hill - borer came , and bored a hole through the rock , so the sea - sucker could get through and keep on sucking . but no sooner were they thus far than the master girl told the king 's son to pour a drop or so of the bottle overboard , and the sea grew so full that they had landed before the sea - sucker could so much as take a single swallow .
