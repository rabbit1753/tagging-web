the chief of the devils at last was the only one left . he made up his mind to surrender , for he knew that his enemy was stronger than mortal man . he came up humbly to momotaro and threw down his iron bar , and kneeling down at the victor 's feet he broke off the horns on his head in token of submission , for they were the sign of his strength and power .
