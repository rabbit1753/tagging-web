and so it did , for very soon the poor brother reached the place , bespattered with mud from head to foot , but ready to do all he could to help with the mule and his master . first they set about finding some stout logs of wood to lay down on the marsh so that they could reach the mule , for by this time his frantic struggles had broken his bridle , and he was deeper in than ever . stepping cautiously along the wood , the poor man contrived to lay hold of the animal 's tale , and with a desperate effort the mule managed to regain his footing on dry ground , but at the cost of leaving his tail in the poor man 's hand . when he saw this the muleteer 's anger knew no bounds , and forgetting that without the help given him he would have lost his mule altogether , he began to abuse the poor man , declaring that he had ruined his beast , and the law would make him pay for it . then , jumping on the back of the mule , which was so glad to be out of the choking mud that he did not seem to mind the loss of his tail , the ungrateful wretch rode on , and that evening reached the inn at evora , where the rich man and the farmer had already arrived for the night .
