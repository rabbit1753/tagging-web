this relieved finn very much , for , after all , he had great confidence in his wife , knowing , as he did , that she had got him out of many a quandary before . the present , however , was the greatest of all ; but , still , he began to get courage and to eat his victuals as usual . oonagh then drew the nine woollen threads of different colours , which she always did to find out the best way of succeeding in anything of importance she went about . she then plaited them into three plaits , with three colours in each , putting one on her right arm , one round her heart , and the third round her right ankle , for then she knew that nothing could fail her that she undertook . having everything now prepared , she sent round to the neighbours and borrowed one - and - twenty iron griddles , which she took and kneaded into the hearts of one - and - twenty cakes of bread , and these she baked on the fire in the usual way , setting them aside in the cupboard according as they were done . she then put down a large pot of new milk , which she made into curds and whey , and gave finn due instructions how to use the curds when far rua should come . having done all this , she sat down quite contented waiting for his arrival on the next day about two o'clock , that being the hour at which he was expected -- for finn knew as much by the sucking of his thumb . now , this was a curious property that finn 's thumb had ; but notwithstanding all the wisdom and logic he used to suck out of it , it could never have stood to him here were it not for the wit of his wife . in this very thing , moreover , he was very much resembled by his great foe , far rua ; for it was well known that the huge strength that he possessed all lay in the middle finger of his right hand , and that if he happened by any chance to lose it , he was no more , notwithstanding his bulk , than a common man .
