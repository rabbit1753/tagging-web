" sister , " said he , one day , as he paraded up and down before the lodge , enjoying his new coat , and fancifying himself the greatest little fellow in the world - as he was , for there was no other beside him-"my sister , are we really alone in the world , or are we playing at it ? is there nobody else living ? and , tell me , was all this great broad earth and this huge big sky made for a little boy and girl like you and me ? " she told him , by no means that there were many folks very unlike a harmless girl and boy , such as they were , who lived in a certain other quarter of the earth , who had killed off all of their kinsfolk . that if he would live blameless and not endanger his life , he must never go where they were . this only served to inflame the boy 's curiosity . he soon after took his bow and arrows and went in that direction . after walking a long time and meeting no one , he became tired , and stretched himself upon a high green knoll where the day 's warmth had melted off the snow .
