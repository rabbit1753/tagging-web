" and how could that come about ? " asked the old woman eagerly , for she had never seen so many precious stones in her life before , and she had a great desire to become the possessor of them . " only put off thy daughter 's wedding for one day , " replied the princess . " and let me watch beside the black knight as he sleeps this night , for i have long had a great desire to see him . " to her astonishment the washerwoman agreed to this request ; for the wily old woman was very anxious to get the jewels , which would make her rich for life , and it did not seem to her that there was any harm in the princess 's request ; for she had made up her mind that she would give the black knight a sleeping - draught , which would effectually prevent him as much as speaking to this strange maiden .
