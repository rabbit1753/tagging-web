far rua , seeing what he had seen , was of the same opinion himself ; his knees knocked together with the terror of finn 's return , and he accordingly hastened in to bid oonagh farewell , and to assure her that , from that day out , he never wished to hear of , much less to see , her husband . " i admit fairly that i 'm not a match for him , " said he , " strong as i am . tell him i will avoid him as i would the plague , and that i will make myself scarce in this part of the country while i live . " finn , in the meantime , had gone into the cradle , where he lay very quietly , his heart in his mouth with delight that far rua was about to take his departure without discovering the tricks that been played off on him . " it 's well for you , " said oonagh , " that he does n't happen to be here , for it 's nothing but hawk 's meat he 'd make of you . " " i know that , " said far rua , " divel a thing else he 'd make of me ; but , before i go , will you let me feel what kind of teeth they are that can eat griddle - cakes like that ? " and he pointed to it as he spoke . " with all the pleasure in life , " says she ; " only as they 're far back in his head you must put your finger a good way in . " far rua was surprised to find so powerful a set of grinders in one so young ; but he was still much more so on finding , when he took his hand from finn 's mouth , that he had left the very finger upon which his whole strength depended behind him . he gave one loud groan and fell down at once with terror and weakness . this was all finn wanted , who now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy . he instantly started out of the cradle , and in a few minutes the great far rua , that was for such a length of time the terror of him and all his followers , was no more .
