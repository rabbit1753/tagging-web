dectera , one of the sisters of conchubar mac nessa , married a prince whose patrimony lay along the shores of the muirnict , and whose capital was dun dalgan . they had one child , a boy , whom they named setanta . as soon as setanta was able to understand the stories and conversation of those around him , he evinced a passion for arms and the martial life , which was so premature and violent as to surprise all who knew him . his thoughts for ever ran on the wars and achievements of the red branch . he knew all the knights by name , the appearance and bearing of each , and what deeds of valour they had severally performed . emain macha , the capital of the clanna rury , was never out of his mind . he saw for ever before his mind its moats and ramparts , its gates and bridges , its streets filled with martial men , its high - raised duns and raths , its branching roads , over which came the tributes of wide ulla to the high king . he had seen his father 's tribute driven thither , and had even longed to be one of the four - footed beasts that he beheld wending their way to the wondrous city . but , above all , he delighted to be told of the great school where the young nobles of ulster were taught martial exercises and the military art , under the superintendence of chosen knights and of the high king himself . of the several knights he had his own opinion , and had already resolved to accept no one as his instructor save fergus mac roy , tanist of ulster .
