the pheasant at once obeyed . he flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings . the bird soon reached the island and took up his position on the roof in the middle of the castle , calling out loudly : " all you devils listen to me ! the great japanese general momotaro has come to fight you and to take your stronghold from you . if you wish to save your lives surrender at once , and in token of your submission you must break off the horns that grow on your forehead . if you do not surrender at once , but make up your mind to fight , we , the pheasant , the dog and the monkey , will kill you all by biting and tearing you to death ! "
