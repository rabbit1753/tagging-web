then cairnech was angry , and he cursed the place , and he dug a grave before the door , and he stood up upon the mound of the grave , and rang his bells and cursed the king and his house , and prophesied his downfall . but he blessed the clans of owen and of niall , and they returned to their own country . then cairnech sent messengers to seek murtough and to draw him away from the witch woman who sought his destruction , but because she was so lovely the king would believe no evil of her ; and whenever he made any sign to go to cairnech , she threw her spell upon the king , so that he could not break away . when he was so weak and faint that he had no power left , she cast a sleep upon him , and she went round the house , putting everything in readiness . she called upon her magic host of warriors , and set them round the fortress , with their spears and javelins pointed inwards towards the house , so that the king would not dare to go out amongst them . and that night was a night of samhain - tide , the eve of wednesday after all souls ' day .
