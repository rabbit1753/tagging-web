so when they had reached the gentleman 's house , and the peasant had given him the pig , he received in payment a rooster who would lay silver coins as often as he was told to do so . then the peasant went his way , well content with his bargain . but on the way home he stayed overnight at a tavern kept by an old woman . and he was so exceedingly happy about his splendid rooster , that he had to boast about him to the old woman , and show her how he went about laying silver coins . and at night , when the peasant was fast asleep , the old woman came and took away his rooster , and put another in its place . no sooner did the peasant awake in the morning than he wanted to set his rooster to work .
