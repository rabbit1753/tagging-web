he hardly knew himself , so changed was he . all traces of the warrior had disappeared , and in the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him . thus completely disguised , he set out for the enemy 's camp alone . in the folds of his silk gown , next his strong heart , was hidden a sharp dagger . the two chiefs kumaso and takeru wore sitting in their tent , resting in the cool of the evening , when the prince approached . they were talking of the news which had recently been carried to them , that the king 's son had entered their country with a large army determined to exterminate their band . they had both heard of the young warrior 's renown , and for the first time in their wicked lives they felt afraid . in a pause in their talk they happened to look up , and saw through the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in sumptuous garments coming towards them . like an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight . little did they dream that it was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise .
