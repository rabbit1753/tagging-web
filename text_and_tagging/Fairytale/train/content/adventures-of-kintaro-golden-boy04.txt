quite unlike other boys , kintaro , grew up all alone in the mountain wilds . as he had no companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak their strange talk . by degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon kintaro as their master , and he used them as his servants and messengers . but his special retainers were the bear , the deer , the monkey and the hare . the bear often brought her cubs for kintaro to romp with . when she came to take them home kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave . he was very fond of the deer too , and would often put his arms round the creature 's neck to show that its long horns did not frighten him . great was the fun they all had together . one day , as usual , kintaro went up into the mountains , followed by the bear , the deer , the monkey , and the hare . after walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads , they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers .
