' my portrait ? ' cried celandine with sudden interest . ' is it possible that prince featherhead can have parted with it ? ' ' he would part with his life sooner , lovely princess , ' answered he ; ' i can assure you of that , for i am prince featherhead . ' at the same moment the fairy of the beech - woods took away the enchantment , and the happy princess recognised her lover , now truly hers , for the trials they had both undergone had so changed and improved them that they were capable of a real love for each other . you may imagine how perfectly happy they were , and how much they had to hear and to tell . but at length it was time to go back to the little house , and as they went along celandine remembered for the first time what a ragged old dress she was wearing , and what an odd appearance she must present . but the prince declared that it became her vastly , and that he thought it most picturesque . when they reached the house the old woman received them very crossly . ' i declare , ' said she , ' that it 's perfectly true : wherever there is a girl you may be sure that a young man will appear before long ! but do n't imagine that i 'm going to have you here -- not a bit of it , be off with you , my fine fellow ! ' prince featherhead was inclined to be angry at this uncivil reception , but he was really too happy to care much , so he only demanded , on celandine 's behalf , that the old dame should give her back her own attire , that she might go away suitably dressed . this request roused her to fury , since she had counted upon the princess 's fine robes to clothe her for the rest of her life , so that it was some time before the prince could make himself heard to explain that he was willing to pay for them .
