' where are thy friend and thy dogs ? ' said rhiannon , and he told her what had befallen pryderi . ' a good friend hast thou lost , ' answered rhiannon , and she went up to the castle and through the gate , which was open . there , in the centre of the courtyard , she beheld pryderi standing , and hastened towards him .
