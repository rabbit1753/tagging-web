lisa picked , aina picked . lisa ate , aina ate , and in a little while their baskets were full . ' now we shall go home , ' said aina . ' no , let us gather a few more , ' said lisa . so they put the baskets down on the ground and began to fill their pinafores , and it was not long before their pinafores were full , too . ' now we shall go home , ' said lina . ' yes , now we shall go home , ' said aina . both girls took a basket in one hand and held up her apron in the other and then turned to go home . but that was easier said than done . they had never been so far in the great wood before , they could not find any road nor path , and soon the girls noticed that they had lost their way .
