he pulled the deer 's foot , and immediately a silver bell sounded and the door flew open , but the prince could see nothing but numbers of hands in the air , each holding a torch . he was so much surprised that he stood quite still , until he felt himself pushed forward by other hands , so that , though he was somewhat uneasy , he could not help going on . with his hand on his sword , to be prepared for whatever might happen , he entered a hall paved with lapis - lazuli , while two lovely voices sang : " the hands you see floating above will swiftly your bidding obey ; if your heart dreads not conquering love , in this place you may fearlessly stay . "
