' now , do n't be so foolish , my dear prince ; but keep up your spirits , for there is no need to despair . go to bed , and when you wake up to - morrow morning the palace will be finished . then you must go all round it , giving a tap here and there on the walls to look as if you had just finished it . ' and so it all turned out just as she had said . as soon as it was daylight prince milan stepped out of his room , and found a palace which was quite a work of art down to the very smallest detail . the magician himself was not a little astonished at its beauty , and could hardly believe his eyes . ' well , you certainly are a splendid workman , ' he said to the prince . ' i see you are very clever with your hands , now i must see if you are equally accomplished with your head . i have thirty daughters in my house , all beautiful princesses . to - morrow i will place the whole thirty in a row . you must walk past them three times , and the third time you must show me which is my youngest daughter hyacinthia . if you do n't guess rightly , you shall lose your head .
