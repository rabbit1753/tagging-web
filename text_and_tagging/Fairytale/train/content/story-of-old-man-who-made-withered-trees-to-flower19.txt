the good old man said : " i am very sorry for that . it is a great pity you did not ask me for the cakes if you wanted them . i would have given you as many as ever you wanted . now please give me the ashes of the mortar , as i wish to keep them in remembrance of my dog . " the neighbor consented at once , and the old man carried home a basket full of ashes . not long after this the old man accidentally scattered some of the ashes made by the burning of the mortar on the trees of his garden . a wonderful thing happened ! it was late in autumn and all the trees had shed their leaves , but no sooner did the ashes touch their branches than the cherry trees , the plum trees , and all other blossoming shrubs burst into bloom . the old man 's garden was suddenly transformed into a beautiful picture of spring . the old man 's delight knew no bounds , and he carefully preserved the remaining ashes . the story of the old man 's garden spread far and wide , and people from far and near came to see the wonderful sight . the old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree . saying " excuse me , " he took the pot of ashes which he had brought with him , and began to climb the tree . every one watched his movements with great interest . at last he climbed to the spot where the tree divided into two great branches . taking up his position here , the old man sat down and scattered the ashes right and left all over the branches and twigs .
