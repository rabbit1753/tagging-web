once upon a time there was a poor widow , who found an egg under a pile of brush as she was gathering kindlings in the forest . she took it and placed it under a goose , and when the goose had hatched it , a little boy slipped out of the shell . the widow had him baptized knos , and such a lad was a rarity ; for when no more than five years old he was grown , and taller than the tallest man . and he ate in proportion , for he would swallow a whole batch of bread at a single sitting , and at last the poor widow had to go to the commissioners for the relief of the poor in order to get food for him . but the town authorities said she must apprentice the boy at a trade , for he was big enough and strong enough to earn his own keep .
