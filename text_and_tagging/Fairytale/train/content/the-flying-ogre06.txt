" have you seen the girl in the red coat ? " asked the stranger . and when the monk replied that he had seen nothing , the other continued : " bonze , you should not lie ! this girl is not a human being , but a flying ogre . of flying ogres there are thousands of varieties , who bring ruin to people everywhere . i have already slain a countless number of them , and have pretty well done away with them . but this one is the worst of all . last night the lord of the heavens gave me a triple command , and that is the reason i have hurried down from the skies . there are eight thousand of us under way in all directions to catch this monster . if you do not tell the truth , monk , then you are sinning against heaven itself ! " upon that the monk did not dare deceive him , but pointed to the hollow tree . the messenger of the skies dismounted , stepped into the tree and looked about him . then he once more mounted his horse , which carried him up the hollow trunk and out at the end of the tree . the monk looked up and could see a small , red flame come out of the tree - top . it was followed by the messenger of the skies . both rose up to the clouds and disappeared . after a time there fell a rain of blood . the ogre had probably been hit by an arrow or captured . afterward the monk told the tale to the scholar who wrote it down .
