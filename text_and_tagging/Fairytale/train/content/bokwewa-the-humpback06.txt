but bokwewa watched closely every word that fell from her lips , and often forgot , like her , all mortal appetite and care of the body , in conferring with her , and noting what she had to say of spirits and fairies , of stars , and streams that never ceased to flow , and the delight of the happy hunting - grounds , and the groves of the blessed . one day kwasynd had gone out as usual , and bokwewa was sitting in the lodge , on the opposite side to his brother 's wife , when she suddenly exclaimed : " i must leave you , " as a tall young man , whose face was like the sun in its brightness , entered , and taking her by the hand he led her to the door . she made no resistance , but turning as she left the lodge , she cast upon bokwewa a smile of kind regard , and was at once , with her companion , gone from his view . he ran to the door and glanced about . he saw nothing ; but looking far off in the sky , he thought that he could discover , at a great distance , a shining track , and the dim figures of two who were vanishing in heaven . when his brother returned , bokwewa related all to him exactly as it had happened . the face of kwasynd changed , and was dark as the night . for several days he would not taste food . sometimes he would fall to weeping for a long time , and now only it seemed that he remembered how gentle and beautiful had been the ways of her who was lost . at last he said that he would go in search of her .
