" now father has gone , you and i must take care of everything till he comes back , " said the mother , as she made her way back to the house . " yes , i will be very good , " said the child , nodding her head , " and when father comes home please tell him how good i have been . then perhaps he will give me a present . " " father is sure to bring you something that you want very much . i know , for i asked him to bring you a doll . you must think of father every day , and pray for a safe journey till he comes back . " " o , yes , when he comes home again how happy i shall be , " said the child , clapping her hands , and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought . it seemed to the mother as she looked at the child 's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper .
