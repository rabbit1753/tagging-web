once on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain , and they agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide it with the other . now the hen found a great big nut , but said nothing about it , and was going to eat it all alone , but the kernel was such a fat one that she could not swallow it down , and it stuck in her throat , so that she was afraid she should choke . " cock ! " cried she , " run as fast as you can and fetch me some water , or i shall choke ! " so the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook , and said , " brook , give me some water , the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her throat . " but the brook answered , " first run to the bride and ask her for some red silk . "
