now a youth had seen the bird as he was carrying the princess to his cave . this cave , though , was in the middle of a sheer wall of rock . one could not climb up to it from below , nor could one climb down to it from above . and as the youth was walking around the rock , another youth came along and asked him what he was doing there . so the first youth told him that the bird with nine heads had carried off the king 's daughter , and had brought her up to his cave . the other chap knew what he had to do . he called together his friends , and they lowered the youth to the cave in a basket .
