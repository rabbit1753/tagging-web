the next day the workmen came to put everything tidy . " this is evidently a deputation , " said the rocket ; " i will receive them with becoming dignity " so he put his nose in the air , and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject . but they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away . then one of them caught sight of him . " hallo ! " he cried , " what a bad rocket ! " and he threw him over the wall into the ditch . " bad rocket ? bad rocket ? " he said , as he whirled through the air ; " impossible ! grand rocket , that is what the man said . bad and grand sound very much the same , indeed they often are the same " ; and he fell into the mud . " it is not comfortable here , " he remarked , " but no doubt it is some fashionable watering - place , and they have sent me away to recruit my health . my nerves are certainly very much shattered , and i require rest .
