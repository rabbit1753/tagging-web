the following thursday the white bear came to fetch his bride . the girl seated herself on his back with her bundle , and then he trotted off . after they had gone a good way , the white bear asked : " are you afraid ? " " no , not at all , " she answered . " just keep a tight hold on my fur , and then you will be in no danger , " said the bear . so she rode on the bear 's back , far , far away , until at last they came to a great rock . there the bear knocked , and at once a door opened through which they entered a great castle , with many brilliantly lighted rooms , where everything gleamed with gold and silver . then they came into a great hall , and there stood a table completely covered with the most splendid dishes . here the white bear gave the maiden a silver bell , and said that if there were anything she wanted , she need only ring the bell , and she should have it at once . and after the maiden had eaten , and evening came on , she felt like lying down and going to sleep . so she rang her bell . at its very first peal she found herself transported to a room in which stood the most beautiful bed one might wish to have , with silken cushions and curtains with golden tassels . all that was in the room was of gold and silver .
