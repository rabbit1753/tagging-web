" " by my truth , you are not , " answered the trout , as he had answered on the two previous occasions . " and who do you say is the most beautiful woman now ?

" " i would not be so sure of that , " answered the trout . without saying another word he dived straight down to the bottom of the well . princess gold - tree , who was ever gentle and courteous , would have stretched out her hand for the cup , had not the other princess stepped between her and her step - mother . " nay , madam , " she said gravely , looking the queen straight in the face . " it is the custom in this land for the one who offers a loving cup to drink from it first herself . " " i will follow the custom gladly , " answered the queen , and she raised the goblet to her mouth . but the other princess , who was watching for closely , noticed that she did not allow the wine that it contained to touch her lips . so she stepped forward and , as if by accident , struck the bottom of the goblet with her shoulder . part of its contents flew into the queen 's face . before she could shut her mouth , went down her throat .
