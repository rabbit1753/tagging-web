there was once upon a time a man and his wife who had an old cat and an old dog . one day the man , whose name was simon , said to his wife , whose name was susan , ' why should we keep our old cat any longer ? she never catches any mice now - a - days , and is so useless that i have made up my mind to drown her . ' but his wife replied , ' do n't do that , for i 'm sure she could still catch mice . ' ' rubbish , ' said simon . ' the mice might dance on her and she would never catch one . i 've quite made up my mind that the next time i see her , i shall put her in the water . '
