" you must call the raven , " said the wolf , and that is what the king 's son did . and the raven came at once , and flew right down with the key , and now the prince could enter the church . then , when he came to the well , there was the duck , sure enough , swimming about as the giant had said . he stood by the well and called the duck , and at last he lured her near him , and seized her . but at the moment he grasped her and lifted her out of the water , she let the egg fall into the well . now the prince again did not know how he was to get hold of it . " well , you must call the salmon , " said the wolf . that is what the king 's son did , and the salmon came at once , and brought up the egg from the bottom of the well . then the wolf told him to squeeze the egg a little . and when the prince squeezed , the giant cried out . " squeeze it again ! " said the wolf , and when the prince did so , the giant cried out far more dolefully , and fearfully and tearfully begged for his life . he would do all the king 's son asked him to , said he , if only he would not squeeze his heart in two . " tell him to give back their original form to your six brothers , whom he turned to stone , and to their brides , as well ; and that then you will spare his life , " said the wolf , and the prince did so . the troll at once agreed , and changed the six brothers into princes , and their brides into kings ' daughters . " now squash the egg ! " cried the wolf . then the prince squeezed the egg in two , and the giant burst into pieces .
