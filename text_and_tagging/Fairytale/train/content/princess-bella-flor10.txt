the had ridden many miles , and at last they came to a river , where they beheld a little fish lying gasping on the sand , and the horse said : ' do you see that little fish ? it will die if you do not put it back in the water . ' ' but , really , we shall never find the princess bella - flor if we waste our time like this ! ' cried jose . ' we never waste time when we are helping others , ' answered the horse . and soon the little fish was swimming happily away . a little while after they reached a castle , which was built in the middle of a very thick wood , and right in front was the princess bella - flor feeding her hens . ' now listen , ' said the horse . ' i am going to give all sorts of little hops and skips , which will amuse the princess bella - flor . then she will tell you that she would like to ride a little way , and you must help her to mount . when she is seated i shall begin to neigh and kick , and you must say that i have never carried a woman before , and that you had better get up behind so as to be able to manage me . once on my back we will go like the wind to the king 's palace .
