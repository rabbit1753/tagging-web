then the princess could restrain herself no longer , but ran forward and threw her arms round her husband . and immediately he knew her again , and said : ' do you remember how i told you that day that you would betray me ? now you see that i spoke the truth . but all that bad time is past . now listen to me : i must still remain enchanted for three months . will you stay here with me till that time is over ? ' so the princess stayed with him , and said to the old man , ' go back to the castle and tell my parents that i am staying here . ' her parents were very much vexed when the old man came back and told them this , but as soon as the three months of the prince 's enchantment were over , he ceased to be an eagle and became once more a man , and they returned home together . and then they lived happily , and we who hear the story are happier still .
