" keep on , my grandchild , " said the old man . " you will surely gain that you seek . to tell you more i am not permitted , but go on as you have begun and you will not be disappointed . to - morrow you will again reach one of my fellow old men , but the one you will see after him will tell you all , and the manner in which you must proceed to accomplish your journey . often has this red swan passed , and those who have followed it have never returned . you must be firm in your resolution , and be prepared for all that may happen . " " so will it be , " answered maidwa ; and they both laid down to sleep . early in the morning the old man ordered his magic kettle to prepare breakfast , so that his guest might eat before leaving . as maidwa passed out , the old man gave him a blessing with his parting advice . maidwa set forth in better spirits than at any time since he had started . night again found him in company with an old man who entertained him kindly , with a frisky little kettle which hurried up to the fire before it was spoken to , bustled about and set his supper briskly before maidwa , and frisked away again , without waiting for orders . the old man also carefully directed him on his way in the morning .
