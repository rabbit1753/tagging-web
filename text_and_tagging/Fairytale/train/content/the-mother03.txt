" oh , only tell me which way he went ! " said the mother . " tell me the way , and i shall find him ! " " i know it ! " said the woman in the black clothes . " but before i tell it , thou must first sing for me all the songs thou hast sung for thy child ! i am fond of them . i have heard them before . i am night . i saw thy tears whilst thou sang'st them ! " " i will sing them all , all ! " said the mother . " but do not stop me now -- i may overtake him -- i may find my child ! " but night stood still and mute . then the mother wrung her hands , sang and wept , and there were many songs , but yet many more tears . then night said , " go to the right , into the dark pine forest . go to where i saw death take his way with thy little child !
