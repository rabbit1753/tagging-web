li dsing was now angry with his son in earnest . therefore notscha 's mother sent him to the rear of the house to keep out of his father 's sight . notscha disappeared and went to his master , in order to ask him what he should do when the dragon returned . his master advised him and notscha went back home . and all the dragon kings of the four seas were assembled , and had bound his parents , with cries and tumult , in order to punish them . notscha ran up and cried with a loud voice : " i will take the punishment for whatever i have done ! my parents are blameless ! what is the punishment you wish to lay upon me ? " " life for life ! " said the dragon . " very well then , i will destroy myself ! " and so he did and the dragons went off satisfied ; while notscha 's mother buried him with many tears . but the spiritual part of notscha , his soul , fluttered about in the air , and was driven by the wind to the cave of the great one . he took it in and said to it : " you must appear to your mother ! forty miles distant from your home rises a green mountain cliff . on this cliff she must build a shrine for you . and after you have enjoyed the incense of human adoration for three years , you shall once more have a human body . " notscha appeared to his mother in a dream , and gave her the whole message , and she awoke in tears . but li dsing grew angry when she told him about it . " it serves the accursed boy right that he is dead ! it is because you are always thinking of him that he appears to you in dreams . you must pay no attention to him . " the woman said no more , but thenceforward he appeared to her daily , as soon as she closed her eyes , and grew more and more urgent in his demand . finally all that was left for her to do was to erect a temple for notscha without li dsing 's knowledge . and notscha performed great miracles in his temple . all prayers made in it were granted . and from far away people streamed to it to burn incense in his honor .
