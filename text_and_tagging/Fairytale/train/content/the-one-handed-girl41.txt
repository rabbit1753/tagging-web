' ah , i owe all my misery to him , ' she said to herself . ' from the first he has hated me , ' but outwardly she showed nothing . and when the king asked her what news there was in the town she only answered : ' you have ridden far ; eat first , and drink , for you must be hungry and thirsty , and then i will tell you my news . ' ' you speak sense , ' answered the king , and silence prevailed for some time longer . then he said : ' now , lady , i have finished , and am refreshed , therefore tell me , i pray you , who you are , and whence you come ? but , first , be seated . ' she bowed her head and sat down on a big scarlet cushion , drawing her little boy , who was asleep in a corner , on to her knee , and began to tell the story of her life . as her brother listened , he would fain have left the house and hidden himself in the forest , but it was his duty to wave the fan of peacock 's feathers over the king 's head to keep off the flies , and he knew he would be seized by the royal guards if he tried to desert his post . he must stay where he was , there was no help for it , and luckily for him the king was too much interested in the tale to notice that the fan had ceased moving , and that flies were dancing right on the top of his thick curly hair .
