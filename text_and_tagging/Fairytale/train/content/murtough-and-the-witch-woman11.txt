and as to that true god of thine , worker of miracles and helper of his people , no miracle in all the world is there that i , by mine own unaided power , can not work the like . i can create a sun and moon ; the heavens i can sprinkle with radiant stars of night . i can call up to life men fiercely fighting in conflict , slaughtering one another . wine i could make of the cold water of the boyne , and sheep of lifeless stones , and swine of ferns . in the presence of the hosts i can make gold and silver , plenty and to spare ; and hosts of famous fighting men i can produce from naught . now , tell me , can thy god work the like ? " " work for us , " says the king , " some of these great wonders . " then sheen went forth out of the house , and she set herself to work spells on murtough , so that he knew not whether he was in his right mind or no . she took of the water of the boyne and made a magic wine thereout , and she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff - balls of the woods , and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats , and with these she fed murtough and the hosts . and when they had eaten , all their strength went from them , and the magic wine sent them into an uneasy sleep and restless slumbers .
