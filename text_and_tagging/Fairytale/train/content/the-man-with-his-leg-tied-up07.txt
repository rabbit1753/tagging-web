in the mean time , aggo dah gauda had reached home , and finding that his daughter had been stolen , his indignation was so thoroughly awakened that he would have forthwith torn every hair from his head , but , being entirely bald , this was out of the question , so , as an easy and natural vent to his feelings , aggo hopped off half a mile in every direction . first he hopped east , then he hopped west , next he hopped north , and again he hopped south , all in search of his daughter ; till the one leg was fairly tired out . then he sat down in his lodge , and resting himself a little , he reflected , and then he vowed that his single leg should never know rest again until he had found his beautiful daughter and brought her home . for this purpose he immediately set out . now that he proceeded more coolly , he could easily track the buffalo - king until he came to the banks of the river , where he saw that he had plunged in and swam over . there having been a frosty night or two since , the water was so covered with thin ice that aggo could not venture upon it , even with one leg . he encamped hard by till it became more solid , and then crossed over and pursued the trail .
