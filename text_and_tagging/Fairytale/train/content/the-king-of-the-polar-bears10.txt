the others nodded assent , and dispatched a messenger to the king to say he must fight the great woof and master him or resign his sovereignty . " for a bear with feathers , " added the messenger , " is no bear at all , and the king we obey must resemble the rest of us . " " i wear feathers because it pleases me , " growled the king . " am i not a great magician ? but i will fight , nevertheless , and if woof masters me he shall be king in my stead . " then he visited his friends , the gulls , who were even then feasting upon the dead bear , and told them of the coming battle . " i shall conquer , " he said , proudly . " yet my people are in the right , for only a hairy one like themselves can hope to command their obedience . "
