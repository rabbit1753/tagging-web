" oh , thank goodness , " sighed the duckling ; " i 'm so ugly , even the dog does n't like to bite me ! " but there he lay perfectly still while the duck shots rattled in the reeds and gun after gun banged out . it was well on in the day before all was quiet , but the unhappy bird dared not get up even then . he waited several hours yet , before he looked about him , and then he hurried away from the marsh as fast as ever he could , running over fields and meadows , and such a wind got up that he had hard work to get along . towards evening he was near a poor little cottage , so crazy was it that it did n't know which way to tumble down , so it remained standing . the wind howled so fiercely round the duckling that he had to sit down on his tail to keep facing it , and it grew worse and worse . then he noticed that one hinge of the door was gone , and it hung so crooked that he could slip indoors through the crack , and so he did .
