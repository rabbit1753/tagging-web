she then set the lodge in perfect order , and , taking her bundle , she set off in search of habitations . these she soon found , and in the enjoyment of the pleasures and pastimes of her new acquaintance , she began to think less and less of her little brother , sheem . she accepted proposals of marriage , and from that time she utterly forgot the abandoned boy . as for poor little sheem , he was soon brought to the pinching turn of his fate . as soon as he had eaten all of the food left in the lodge , he was obliged to pick berries , and live off of such roots as he could dig with his slender hands . as he wandered about in search of wherewithal to stay his hunger , he often looked up to heaven , and saw the gray clouds going up and down . and then he looked about upon the wide earth , but he never saw sister nor brother returning from their long delay . at last , even the roots and berries gave out . they were blighted by the frost or hidden out of reach by the snow , for the mid - winter had come on , and poor little sheem was obliged to leave the lodge and wander away in search of food .
