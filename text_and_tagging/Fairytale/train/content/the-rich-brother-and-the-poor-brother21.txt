at this answer the wife grew very angry . she began to cry , and made such a noise that all the neighbours heard her and put their heads out of the windows , to see what was the matter . ' it was absurd , ' she sobbed out , ' quite unjust . indeed , if you came to think of it , the gift was worth nothing , as when her husband made it he was a bachelor , and since then he had been married , and she had never given her consent to any such thing . ' and so she lamented all day and all night , till the poor man was nearly worried to death ; and at last he did what she wished , and summoned his brother in a court of law to give up the houses which , he said , had only been lent to him . but when the evidence on both sides had been heard , the judge decided in favour of the poor man , which made the rich lady more furious than ever , and she determined not to rest until she had gained the day . if one judge would not give her the houses another should , and so time after time the case was tried over again , till at last it came before the highest judge of all , in the city of evora . her husband was heartily tired and ashamed of the whole affair , but his weakness in not putting a stop to it in the beginning had got him into this difficulty , and now he was forced to go on .
