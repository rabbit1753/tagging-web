duchess started ! she opened the door of the top oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham , and there stood a fine brown pie,--and through a hole in the top of the pie - crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty - pan ! duchess drew a long breath-- " then i must have been eating mouse ! ... no wonder i feel ill .... but perhaps i should feel worse if i had really swallowed a patty - pan ! " duchess reflected--"what a very awkward thing to have to explain to ribby ! i think i will put my pie in the back - yard and say nothing about it . when i go home , i will run round and take it away . " she put it outside the back - door , and sat down again by the fire , and shut her eyes ; when ribby arrived with the doctor , she seemed fast asleep . " gammon , ha , ha ? " said the doctor . " i am feeling very much better , " said duchess , waking up with a jump . " i am truly glad to hear it ! " he has brought you a pill , my dear duchess ! " " i think i should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse , " said duchess , backing away from the magpie , who sidled up with something in his beak . " it is only a bread pill , you had much better take it ; drink a little milk , my dear duchess ! " " gammon ? gammon ? " said the doctor , while duchess coughed and choked . " do n't say that again ! " said ribby , losing her temper--"here , take this bread and jam , and get out into the yard ! " " gammon and spinach ! ha ha ha ! " shouted dr . maggotty triumphantly outside the back door . " i am feeling very much better , my dear ribby , " said duchess . " do you not think that i had better go home before it gets dark ? " " perhaps it might be wise , my dear duchess . i will lend you a nice warm shawl , and you shall take my arm . " " i would not trouble you for worlds ; i feel wonderfully better . one pill of dr . maggotty---- " " indeed it is most admirable , if it has cured you of a patty - pan ! i will call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept .
