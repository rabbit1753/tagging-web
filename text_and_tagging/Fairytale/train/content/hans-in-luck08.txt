" well , to be sure , " said hans , scratching his head . " who would have thought it ? of course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man has a beast of his own to kill . for my part i do not care much about cow beef , it is rather tasteless . now , if i had but a young pig , that is much better meat , and then the sausages ! " " look here , hans , " said the butcher , " just for love of you i will exchange , and will give you my pig instead of your cow . " " heaven reward such kindness ! " cried hans . handing over the cow , he received in exchange the pig , who was turned out of his wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string . so on went hans , thinking how everything turned out according to his wishes , and how , if trouble overtook him , all was sure to be set right directly . after a while he fell in with a peasant , who was carrying a fine white goose under his arm . they bid each other good - day , and hans began to tell about his luck , and how he had made so many good exchanges . and the peasant told how he was taking the goose to a christening feast .
