one sunshiny morning , when there were just two or three promising clouds rolling moistly about the sky , aggo prepared to go out a - fishing ; but before he left the lodge he reminded her of her strange and industrious lover , whom she had never seen . " my daughter , " said he , " i am going out to fish , and as the day will be a pleasant one , you must recollect that we have an enemy near , who is constantly going about with two eyes that never close , and do not expose yourself out of the lodge . " with this excellent advice , aggo hopped off in high spirits ; but he had scarcely reached the fishing - ground when he heard a voice singing , at a distance : man with the leg tied up , man with the leg tied up , broken hip -- hip-- hipped . man with the leg tied up , man with the leg tied up , broken leg -- leg-- legged . there was no one in sight , but aggo heard the words quite plainly , and as he suspected the ditty to be the work of his enemies , the buffalos , he hopped home as fast as his one leg could carry him . meantime , the daughter had no sooner been left alone in the lodge than she thought with herself : " it is hard to be thus forever kept in doors . but my father says it would be dangerous to venture abroad . i know what i will do . i will get on the top of the house , and there i can comb and dress my hair , and no one can harm me . " she accordingly ascended the roof and busied herself in untying and combing her beautiful hair ; for it was truly beautiful , not only of a fine , glossy quality , but it was so very long that it hung over the eaves of the house and reached down on the ground , as she sat dressing it .
