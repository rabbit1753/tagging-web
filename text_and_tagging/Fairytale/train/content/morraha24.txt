" oh , he will not kill me . he knew me ; and must be pardoned . " and the king took me home with him , and gave orders that i should be well cared for . i was so wise when i got food i would not eat one morsel until i got a knife and fork . the man told the king , and the king came to see if it was true , and i got a knife and fork , and i took the knife in one paw and the fork in the other , and i bowed to the king . the king gave orders to bring him drink , and it came ; and the king filled a glass of wine , and gave it to me . i took hold of it in my paw , and drank it , and thanked the king . " oh , on my honour , it is some king that has lost him when he came on the island ; and i will keep him , as he is trained . perhaps he will serve us yet . " and this is the sort of king he was -- a king who had not a child living . eight sons were born to him and three daughters , and they were stolen the same night they were born . no matter what guard was placed over them , the child would be gone in the morning . the queen was now carrying the twelfth child , and when she was lying - in , the king took me with him to watch the baby . the women were not satisfied with me . " oh , " said the king , " what was all your watching ever ? one that was born to me i have not ; and i will leave this one in the dog 's care , and he will not let it go . "
