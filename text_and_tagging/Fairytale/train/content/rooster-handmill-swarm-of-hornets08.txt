" do not grieve about that , " said the gentleman , and gave him a large , large hornets ' nest , full of hornets , who flew out in swarms and stung any one whom they were told to sting , until one said " stop ! " to them . now when the peasant again came to the old woman , he told her he had a swarm of hornets who obeyed his commands . " heavens above ! " cried the woman , " that 's something worth while seeing ! " " you may see it without any trouble , " replied the peasant , and at once called : " out , out , my hornets and sting the old woman ! " and at once the entire swarm fell upon the old woman , who began to scream pitifully . she begged the peasant to please call back his hornets , and said she was only too willing to give back the rooster and the mill she had taken .
