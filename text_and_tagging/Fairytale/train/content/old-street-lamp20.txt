" what is the use of all my capabilities , " sighed the old lamp , " when i can not obtain any wax lights ? they have only oil and tallow here , and these will not do . " one day a great heap of wax - candle ends found their way into the cellar . the larger pieces were burned , and the smaller ones the old woman kept for waxing her thread . so there were now candles enough , but it never occurred to any one to put a little piece in the lamp . " here i am now , with my rare powers , " thought the lamp . " i have faculties within me , but i can not share them . they do not know that i could cover these white walls with beautiful tapestry , or change them into noble forests or , indeed , to anything else they might wish .
