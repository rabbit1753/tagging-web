" tin soldier , " said the goblin , " do n't wish for what does not belong to you . " but the tin soldier pretended not to hear . " very well ; wait till to - morrow , then , " said the goblin . when the children came in the next morning , they placed the tin soldier in the window . now , whether it was the goblin who did it , or the draught , is not known , but the window flew open , and out fell the tin soldier , heels over head , from the third story , into the street beneath . it was a terrible fall ; for he came head downwards his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones , and his one leg up in the air . the servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him ; but he was nowhere to be seen , although once they nearly trod upon him . if he had called out , " here i am , " it would have been all right , but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform .
