after that a strange thing happened . one morning pryderi and manawyddan rose up to hunt , and loosened their dogs , which ran before them . they came to a small bush . at the bush , the dogs shrank away as if frightened . they returned to their masters , their hair brisling on their backs . ' we must see what is in that bush , ' said pryderi , and what was in it was a boar , with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains . and he came out , and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him , driven on by the men . long he stood at bay . then at last he betook himself to flight , and fled to a castle which was newly built , in a place where no building had ever been known . into the castle he ran , and the dogs after him , and long though their masters looked and listened . they neither saw nor heard aught concerning dogs or boar .
