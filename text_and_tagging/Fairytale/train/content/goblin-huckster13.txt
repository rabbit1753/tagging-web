" this is a wonderful place , " said the goblin ; " i never expected such a thing . i should like to stay here with the student . " then the little man thought it over , for he was a sensible sprite . at last he sighed , " but the student has no jam ! " so he went downstairs again to the huckster 's shop , and it was a good thing he got back when he did , for the cask had almost worn out the lady 's tongue . he had given a description of all that he contained on one side , and was just about to turn himself over to the other side to describe what was there , when the goblin entered and restored the tongue to the lady . from that time forward , the whole shop , from the cash - box down to the pine - wood logs , formed their opinions from that of the cask . they all had such confidence in him and treated him with so much respect that when , in the evening , the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art , they fancied it must all come from the cask . the goblin caught up the wonderful book , which lay on the table , and popped it into his red cap , which he held tightly with both hands . the greatest treasure in the house was saved , and he ran away with it to the roof and seated himself on the chimney . the flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat with both hands pressed tightly over his cap , in which the treasure lay . it was then that he understood what feelings were really strongest in his heart and knew exactly which way they tended . yet , when the fire was extinguished and the goblin again began to reflect , he hesitated , and said at last , " i must divide myself between the two ; i can not quite give up the huckster , because of the jam . " this is a representation of human nature . we are like the goblin ; we all go to visit the huckster , " because of the jam . "
