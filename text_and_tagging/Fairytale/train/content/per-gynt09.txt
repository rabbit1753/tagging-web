" here is my smeller , so take a good look ! " said he . " here is a taste of the soup that i cook ! " said per gynt , and he poured the whole kettleful of soup over his nose . the troll rushed off lamenting loudly . from all the heights around came laughter and derision and calls of : " gyri soupsmeller , gyri soupsmeller ! " thereupon all was quiet for a time . before very long the noise and tumult outside began again . per gynt looked out , and saw a wagon drawn by bears . the great troll was loaded upon it , and off they went with him up the fjoll . suddenly a pail of water was poured down through the chimney , smothering the fire , and per gynt sat in the dark . then laughter and jibes came from every corner , and one voice said : " now per gynt will be no better off than the dairy - maids in the hut at val !
