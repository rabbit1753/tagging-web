putting her hand out , she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with a silken cord and tassels . undoing this very carefully , she took out of the box the mirror that her husband had given her years ago . " when you were still a little child your father went up to the capital and brought me back as a present this treasure ; it is called a mirror . this i give you before i die . if , after i have ceased to be in this life , you are lonely and long to see me sometimes , then take out this mirror and in the clear and shining surface you will always see me - so will you be able to meet with me often and tell me all your heart . though i shall not be able to speak , i shall understand and sympathize with you , whatever may happen to you in the future . " with these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter . the mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest , and sinking back without another word her spirit passed quietly away that day .
