as the old woman spoke so kindly , the girl took courage , consented , and went to her work . she did everything to the old woman 's satisfaction , and shook the bed with such a will that the feathers flew about like snow - flakes : and so she led a good life , had never a cross word , but boiled and roast meat every day . when she had lived a long time with mother hulda , she began to feel sad , not knowing herself what ailed her ; at last she began to think she must be home - sick ; and although she was a thousand times better off than at home where she was , yet she had a great longing to go home . at last she said to her mistress , " i am home - sick , and although i am very well off here , i can not stay any longer ; i must go back to my own home . " mother hulda answered , " it pleases me well that you should wish to go home , and , as you have served me faithfully , i will undertake to send you there ! "
