jemima puddle - duck was not much in the habit of flying . she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl , and then she jumped off into the air . she flew beautifully when she had got a good start . she skimmed along over the tree - tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood , where the trees and brushwood had been cleared . jemima alighted rather heavily , and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting - place . she rather fancied a tree - stump amongst some tall fox - gloves . but -- seated upon the stump , she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper .
