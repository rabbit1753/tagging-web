well , i was preparing myself to try strength with him , when back he comes , with the kitchen cleaver in his hand , and without saying a word he gives two bangs to the handle of the reaping - hook that was holding me up , and whap it came in two . ' good morning to you , dan , ' says the spiteful little blackguard , when he saw me cleanly falling down with a bit of the handle in my hand ; ' i thank you for your visit , and fair weather after you , daniel . ' i had no time to make any answer to him , for i was tumbling over and over , and rolling and rolling , at the rate of a fox - hunt . ' god help me ! ' says i , ' but this is a pretty pickle for a decent man to be seen in at this time of the night . i am now sold fairly . ' the word was not out of my mouth , when , whiz ! what should fly by close to my ear but a flock of wild geese , all the way from my own bog of ballyasheenagh , else how should they know me ?
