yes , sure enough , just then a shaggy , reddish - brown wolf 's head looked out from under the kiln ! what did walter do now ? yes , the brave walter who alone could manage four , threw his drum far away , took to his heels and ran . he ran as fast as he could back to the mill . but , alas ! the wolf ran after him . walter looked back ; the wolf was quicker than he and only a few steps behind him . then walter ran faster . but fear got the better of him , he neither heard nor saw anything more . he ran over sticks , stones and ditches . he lost drum - sticks , sabre , bow , and air - pistol , and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of grass . there he lay , and the wolf jumped on to him .... it was a gruesome tale ! now you may well believe that it was all over with walter and all his adventures . that would have been a pity . but do not be surprised if it was not quite so bad as that , for the wolf was quite a friendly one . he certainly jumped on to walter , but he only shook his coat and rubbed his nose against his face . walter shrieked . yes , he shrieked terribly !
