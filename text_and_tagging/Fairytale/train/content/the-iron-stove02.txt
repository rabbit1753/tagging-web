then he gave her someone for a guide , who walked near her and said nothing , but he brought her in two hours to her house . there was great joy in the castle when the princess came back , and the old king fell on her neck and kissed her . but she was very much troubled , and said , ' dear father , listen to what has befallen me ! i should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if i had not come to an iron stove , to whom i have had to promise that i will go back to free him and marry him ! ' the old king was so frightened that he nearly fainted , for she was his only daughter . so they consulted together , and determined that the miller 's daughter , who was very beautiful , should take her place . they took her there , gave her a knife , and said she must scrape at the iron stove . she scraped for twenty - four hours , but did not make the least impression . when the day broke , a voice called from the iron stove , ' it seems to me that it is day outside . ' then she answered , ' it seems so to me ; i think i hear my father 's mill rattling . ' ' so you are a miller 's daughter ! then go away at once , and tell the king 's daughter to come . '
