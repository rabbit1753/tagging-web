he again exacted a promise of secresy , and went back to his tree . the eldest took his seat near the fire . when the hunter came in he was surprised to see the ashes scattered about . " why , my son , " he said , " you must have played very hard to day to raise such a dust all alone . " " yes , " the boy answered , " i was very lonesome , and i ran round and round -- that is the cause of it . " the next day the hunter made ready for the chase as usual . the boy said , " father , try and hunt all day , and see what you can kill . " he had no sooner set out than the boy called his friend , and they played and chased each other round the lodge . they had great delight in each other 's company , and made merry by the hour . the hunter was again returning , and came to a rising ground , which caught the winds as they passed , and he heard his son laughing and making a noise , but the sounds as they reached him on the hill - top , seemed as if they arose from two persons playing . at the same time the younger boy stopped , and after saying " your father is coming , " he stole away , under cover of the high grass , to his hollow tree , which was not far off .
