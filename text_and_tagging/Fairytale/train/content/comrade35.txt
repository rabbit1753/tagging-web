" are you not happy , since you need not strike ? " said he . " yes , indeed , i never was happier , " said the man . " that is how happy i was when you delivered me out of the block of ice , " said the comrade . " keep all you have : i need nothing , for i am a disembodied spirit . " and he told him he was the wine - dealer who had lain in the block of ice before the church door , spat upon by all . he had become his comrade , and had aided him , because the youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he might have peace , and a burial in consecrated ground . he had been permitted to accompany him for the space of a year , and the time had run out when he had first parted with him . now he had once more been allowed to visit him ; yet on this occasion he would have to part for all time , for the bells of heaven were calling him .
