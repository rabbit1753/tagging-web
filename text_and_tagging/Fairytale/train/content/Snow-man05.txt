" this is really beautiful , " said a young girl , who had come into the garden with a young man . they both stood still near the snow man , and contemplated the glittering scene . " summer can not show a more beautiful sight , " she exclaimed , while her eyes sparkled . " and we ca n't have such a fellow as this in the summer time , " replied the young man , pointing to the snow man ; " he is capital . " the girl laughed , and nodded at the snow man , and then tripped away over the snow with her friend . the snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet , as if she had been treading on starch . " who are these two ? " asked the snow man of the yard - dog . " you have been here longer than i have . do you know them ? " " of course i know them , " replied the yard - dog ; " she has stroked my back many times , and he has given me a bone of meat . i never bite those two . " " but what are they ? " asked the snow man . " they are lovers , " he replied ; " they will go and live in the same kennel by - and - by , and gnaw at the same bone . away , away ! " " are they the same kind of beings as you and i ? " asked the snow man .
