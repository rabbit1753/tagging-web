jack next took a great bunch of keys from the pocket of blunderbore , and went into the castle again . he made a strict search through all the rooms , and in one of them found three ladies tied up by the hair of their heads , and almost starved to death . they told him that their husbands had been killed by the giants , who had then condemned them to be starved to death because they would not eat the flesh of their own dead husbands . " ladies , " said jack , " i have put an end to the monster and his wicked brother ; and i give you this castle and all the riches it contains , to make some amends for the dreadful pains you have felt . " he then very politely gave them the keys of the castle , and went further on his journey to wales .
