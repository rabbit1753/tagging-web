it is easy to imagine how the princess felt . she opened her arms , and could neither ask questions nor reply to them , so moved and delighted was she . but the prince ran hastily up the hill , embraced her tenderly , and thanked her for delivering him . nor did he forget the little old man , but thanked him with many civil expressions for his powerful aid . then they sat down together on the hill - top , and had a pleasant talk . the prince told how he had been turned into a wolf , and of all he had suffered while running about in the forest ; and the princess told of her grief , and the many tears she had shed while he had been gone . so they sat the whole night through , and never noticed it until the stars grew pale and it was light enough to see . when the sun rose , they saw that a broad path led from the hill - top straight to the royal castle ; for they had a view of the whole surrounding country from the hill - top . then the old man said : " lovely maiden , turn around ! do you see anything out yonder ? " " yes , " said the princess , " i see a horseman on a foaming horse , riding as fast as he can . " then the old man said : " he is a messenger sent on ahead by the king your father . and your father with all his army is following him . " that pleased the princess above all things , and she wanted to descend the hill at once to meet her father . but the old man detained her and said : " wait a while , it is too early yet . let us wait and see how everything turns out .
