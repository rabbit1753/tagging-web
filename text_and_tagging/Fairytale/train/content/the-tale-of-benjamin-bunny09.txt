when mr . mcgregor returned about half an hour later , he observed several things which perplexed him . it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs -- only the foot - marks were too ridiculously little ! also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the green - house , locking the door upon the outside . when peter got home , his mother forgave him , because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat . cotton - tail and peter folded up the pocket - handkerchief , and old mrs . rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling , with the rabbit - tobacco .
