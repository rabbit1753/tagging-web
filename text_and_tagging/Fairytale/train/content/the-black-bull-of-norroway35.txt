" master , " he said , " we would fain ken who the sweet singer is who singeth through the night in thy chamber ? " " singer ! " he repeated . " there is no singer . my chamber hath been as quiet as the grave , and i have slept a dreamless sleep ever since i came to live at the cottage . " the old huntsman shook his head . " taste not the old wife 's draught this night , master , " he said earnestly ; " then wilt thou hear what other ears have heard . " at other times the black knight would have laughed at his words , but to - day the man spoke with such earnestness that he could not but listen to them . so that evening , when the washerwoman , as was her wo nt , brought his sleeping - draught of spiced ale to his bedside , he told her that it was not sweet enough for his liking . and when she turned and went to the kitchen to fetch some honey to sweeten it , he jumped out of bed and poured it all out of the window , and when she came back he pretended that he had drunk it .
