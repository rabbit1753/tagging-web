" no , " said the youth . " i will wait below here , until you are in safety . " at first the king 's daughter was not willing ; yet at last she allowed herself to be persuaded , and climbed into the basket . but before she did so , she took a long pin from her hair , broke it into two halves and gave him one and kept the other . she also divided her silken kerchief with him , and told him to take good care of both her gifts . but when the other man had drawn up the king 's daughter , he took her along with him , and left the youth in the cave , in spite of all his calling and pleading . the youth now took a walk about the cave . there he saw a number of maidens , all of whom had been carried off by the bird with nine heads , and who had perished there of hunger . and on the wall hung a fish , nailed against it with four nails . when he touched the fish , the latter turned into a handsome youth , who thanked him for delivering him , and they agreed to regard each other as brothers . soon the first youth grew very hungry . he stepped out in front of the cave to search for food , but only stones were lying there . then , suddenly , he saw a great dragon , who was licking a stone . the youth imitated him , and before long his hunger had disappeared . he next asked the dragon how he could get away from the cave , and the dragon nodded his head in the direction of his tail , as much as to say he should seat himself upon it . so he climbed up , and in the twinkling of an eye he was down on the ground , and the dragon had disappeared .
