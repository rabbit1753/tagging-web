and the little toad went and brought out a great chest . then they gave her food and drink , and led her to a beautifully made bed of silk and samite , on which she lay down and slept soundly . when the day dawned she arose , and the old toad gave her three things out of the huge chest to take with her . she would have need of them , for she had to cross a high glass mountain , three cutting swords , and a great lake . when she had passed these she would find her lover again . so she was given three large needles , a plough - wheel , and three nuts , which she was to take great care of . she set out with these things , and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind her feet and then in front , and so got over it , and when she was on the other side put them carefully away .
