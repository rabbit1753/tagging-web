and the tree looked at all the splendour and freshness of the flowers in the garden , and then looked at itself , and wished that it had been left lying in the dark corner of the lumber - room ; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood , of the merry christmas eve , and of the little mice who had listened so happily to the story of humpty dumpty . ' too late ! too late ! ' thought the old tree . ' if only i had enjoyed myself whilst i could . now all is over and gone . ' and a servant came and cut the tree into small pieces , there was quite a bundle of them ; they flickered brightly under the great copper in the brew - house ; the tree sighed deeply , and each sigh was like a pistol - shot ; so the children who were playing there ran up , and sat in front of the fire , gazing at it , and crying , ' piff ! puff ! bang ! ' but for each report , which was really a sigh , the tree was thinking of a summer 's day in the wood , or of a winter 's night out there , when the stars were shining ; it thought of christmas eve , and of humpty dumpty , which was the only story it had heard , or could tell , and then the tree had burnt away . the children played on in the garden , and the youngest had the golden star on his breast , which the tree had worn on the happiest evening of its life ; and now that was past - and the tree had passed away - and the story too , all ended and done with . and that 's the way with all stories !
