when he recounted his adventures they believed him mad . the young men laughed at him - him , strong desire - who feared to walk to the river at night - time . he left the lodge , and ere their laughter had ceased , returned with his trophy . he held aloft the head of the red sorcerer , with the great ghastly leer which lighted it up before his last sleep , at prospect of a thousand future murders , fresh upon it . it was easily recognized , and the young men who had scoffed at strong desire shrunk into the corners out of sight . strong desire had conquered the terrible red head ! all doubts of the truth of his adventures were dispelled . he was greeted with joy , and placed among the first warriors of the nation . he finally became a chief , and his family were ever after respected and esteemed .
