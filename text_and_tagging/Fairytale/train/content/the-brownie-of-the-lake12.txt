when things had reached this pass , the brownie told the young man that he had better ask barbaik to marry him , and this time the girl did not turn rudely away , but listened patiently to the end . in her eyes he was as ugly and awkward as ever , but he would certainly make a most useful husband , and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time , just like a young lady , and as for the rest of the day , it would not be half long enough for all she meant to do . she would wear the beautiful dresses that came when she wished for them , and visit her neighbours , who would be dying of envy all the while , and she would be able to dance as much as she wished . jegu would always be there to work for her and save for her , and watch over her . so , like a well - brought - up girl , barbaik answered that it should be as her father pleased , knowing quite well that old riou had often said that after he was dead there was no one so capable of carrying on the farm .
