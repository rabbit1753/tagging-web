they replied in the negative . " we have been treated by you with kindness and affection . it is not for any slight we have received that we weep . our mission is not to you only . we come from the other land to test mankind , and to try the sincerity of the living . often we have heard the bereaved by death say that if the lost could be restored , they would devote their lives to make them happy . we have been moved by the bitter lamentations which have reached the place of the departed , and have come to make proof of the sincerity of those who have lost friends . we are your two dead sisters . three moons were allotted us by the master of life to make the trial . more than half the time had been successfully passed , when the angry feelings of your wife indicated the irksomeness you felt at our presence , and has made us resolve on our departure . " they continued to talk to the hunter and his wife , gave them instructions as to a future life , and pronounced a blessing upon them .
