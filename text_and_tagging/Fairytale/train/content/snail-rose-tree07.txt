" that 's very sad , " said the rose tree . " i can not creep into myself , however much i might wish to do so ; i have to go on bearing roses . then they drop their leaves , which are blown away by the wind . but i once saw how a rose was laid in the mistress 's hymn - book , and how one of my roses found a place in the bosom of a young beautiful girl , and how another was kissed by the lips of a child in the glad joy of life . that did me good ; it was a real blessing . those are my recollections , my life . " and the rose tree went on blooming in innocence , while the snail lay idling in his house -- the world was nothing to him .
