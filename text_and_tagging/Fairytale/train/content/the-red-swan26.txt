they traveled slowly , and looked with double joy on the beautiful country over which they had both so lately passed with hearts ill at ease . after two or three days they reached the lodge of the third old man who had entertained him with the singing kettle ; but the kettle was not there . the old man , nevertheless , received them very kindly , and said to maidwa , " you see what your perseverance has secured you ; do so always , and you will succeed in whatever you undertake . " on the following morning , when they were about to start , he pulled from the side of the lodge a bag , which he presented to maidwa , saying , " grandchild , i give you this ; it contains a present for you ; and i hope you will live happily till old age . " bidding him farewell , they again set forward ; and they soon came to the second old man 's lodge ; he also gave them a present and bestowed his blessing . nor did maidwa see any thing here of the frisky little kettle which had been so lively on his former visit .
