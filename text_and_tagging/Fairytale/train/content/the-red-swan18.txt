young man , the errand you are bound on is beset with trials and difficulties . numbers have passed with the same purpose as that which now prompts you , but they never returned . be careful , and if your guardian spirits are powerful you may succeed . this red swan you are following is the daughter of a magician who has abundance of every thing , but only this one child , whom he values more than the sacred arrows . in former times he wore a cap of wampum , which was attached to his scalp . but powerful indians , warriors of a distant chief , came and told him that their chief 's daughter was on the brink of the grave , and that she herself requested his wampum - cap , which she was confident would save her life . ' if i can only see it , ' she said , ' i will recover . ' it was for this cap they had come , and after long solicitation the magician at length consented to part with it , in the hope that it would restore to health the dying maiden , although when he took it off to hand it to the messengers it left the crown of his head bare and bloody . years have passed since , and it has not healed . the coming of the warriors to procure it for the sick maiden was a cheat , and they are now constantly making sport of the unhappy scalp -- dancing it about from village to village -- and on every insult it receives the poor old chief to whom it belongs groans with pain .
