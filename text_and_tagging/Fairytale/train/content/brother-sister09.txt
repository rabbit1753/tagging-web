then the door was opened to him , and he went in , and rested the whole night long on his soft bed . the next morning the hunt began anew , and when the fawn heard the hunting - horns and the tally - ho of the huntsmen he could rest no longer , and said , " little sister , let me out , i must go . " the sister opened the door and said , " now , mind you must come back at night and say the same words . " when the king and his hunters saw the fawn with the golden collar again , they chased him closely , but he was too nimble and swift for them . this lasted the whole day , and at last the hunters surrounded him , and one of them wounded his foot a little , so that he was obliged to limp and to go slowly . then a hunter slipped after him to the little house , and heard how he called out , " little sister , let me in , " and saw the door open and shut again after him directly . the hunter noticed all this carefully , went to the king , and told him all he had seen and heard . then said the king , " to - morrow we will hunt again .
