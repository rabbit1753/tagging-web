she took a few steps , such as a crawling animal may take , and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt . there were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens . and she sat down to rest by a kitchen garden . " what a number of different creatures there are that i never knew ! and how beautiful and great the world is ! but one must look round in it , and not stay in one spot . " and then she hopped into the kitchen garden . " how green it is here ! how beautiful it is here ! " " i know that , " said the caterpillar , on the leaf , " my leaf is the largest here . it hides half the world from me , but i do n't care for the world . " " cluck , cluck ! " and some fowls came . they tripped about in the cabbage garden . the fowl who marched at the head of them had a long sight . she spied the caterpillar on the green leaf , and pecked at it , so that the caterpillar fell on the ground , where it twisted and writhed .
