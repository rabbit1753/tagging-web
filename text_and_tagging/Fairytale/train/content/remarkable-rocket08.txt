" ahem ! ahem ! " said the rocket angrily . he was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in . " a delightful voice , certainly , " continued the frog ; " i hope you will come over to the duck - pond . i am off to look for my daughters . i have six beautiful daughters , and i am so afraid the pike may meet them . he is a perfect monster , and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them . well , good - bye : i have enjoyed our conversation very much , i assure you . " " conversation , indeed ! " said the rocket . " you have talked the whole time yourself . that is not conversation . " " somebody must listen , " answered the frog , " and i like to do all the talking myself . it saves time , and prevents arguments . " " but i like arguments , " said the rocket . " i hope not , " said the frog complacently . " arguments are extremely vulgar , for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions . good - bye a second time ; i see my daughters in the distance and the little frog swam away . " you are a very irritating person , " said the rocket , " and very ill - bred . i hate people who talk about themselves , as you do , when one wants to talk about oneself , as i do . it is what i call selfishness , and selfishness is a most detestable thing , especially to any one of my temperament , for i am well known for my sympathetic nature . in fact , you should take example by me ; you could not possibly have a better model . now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it , for i am going back to court almost immediately . i am a great favourite at court ; in fact , the prince and princess were married yesterday in my honour . of course you know nothing of these matters , for you are a provincial .
