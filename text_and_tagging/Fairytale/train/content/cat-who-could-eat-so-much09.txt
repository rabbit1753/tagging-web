when the cat had gone a bit further , she met the mother bear , who was clawing at the tree - stems so that the bark flew , so angry was she to have lost her little one . " good - day , you biting mother bear , " said the cat . " good - day , cat ! have you had anything to eat yet to - day ? " said the mother bear . " o , only a little . my fast has hardly been broken , " said the cat . " i have had no more than a dish of mush and a little potful of fat and the man in the house and the woman in the stable and the bell - cow at the manger and the leaf - sweeper in the orchard and the weasel on the stone - pile and the squirrel in the hazel - bush and the fox , the sly - boots , and the hopping hare and the wild wolf and the little bear brown - coat , and i 'm thinking over whether i ought not to eat you as well , " said she , and seized the mother bear and ate her , too .
