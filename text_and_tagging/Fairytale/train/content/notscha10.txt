notscha laughed and said : " i have heard tell that dragon - sinews make good cords . i will draw one out and bring it to my father , and he can tie his armor together with it . " and with that he drew out the dragon 's back sinew and took it home . in the meantime the dragon - king , full of fury , had hastened to notscha 's father li dsing and demanded that notscha be delivered up to him . but li dsing replied : " you must be mistaken , for my boy is only seven years old and incapable of committing such misdeeds . " while they were still quarreling notscha came running up and cried : " father , i 'm bringing along a dragon 's sinew for you , so that you may bind up your armor with it ! " now the dragon broke out into tears and furious scolding . he threatened to report li dsing to the ruler of the heaven , and took himself off , snorting with rage .
