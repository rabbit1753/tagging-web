well , the poor prince had nothing for it but to walk back to the castle ; and through it and round it he walked , and the finest of eating and drinking he got , and a bed of bog - down to sleep on , and long walks he took through gardens and lawns , but not a sight could he get , high or low , of seven inches . he , before a week , got tired of it , he was so lonesome for his true love ; and at the end of a month he did n't know what to do with himself . one morning he went into the treasure room , and took notice of a beautiful snuff - box on the table that he did n't remember seeing there before . he took it in his hands and opened it , and out seven inches walked on the table . ' i think , prince , ' says he , ' you 're getting a little tired of my castle ? ' ' ah ! ' says the other , ' if i had my princess here , and could see you now and then , i 'd never know a dismal day . ' ' well , you 're long enough here now , and you 're wanted there above . keep your bride 's crowns safe , and whenever you want my help , open this snuff - box . now take a walk down the garden , and come back when you 're tired .
