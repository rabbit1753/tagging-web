ribby and tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again . they poked under the beds with ribby 's umbrella , and they rummaged in cupboards . they even fetched a candle , and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics . they could not find anything , but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs . " yes , it is infested with rats , " said tabitha tearfully , " i caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen , and we had them for dinner last saturday . and once i saw the old father rat -- an enormous old rat , cousin ribby . i was just going to jump upon him , when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole . " " the rats get upon my nerves , cousin ribby , " said tabitha . ribby and tabitha searched and searched . they both heard a curious roly - poly noise under the attic floor . but there was nothing to be seen .
