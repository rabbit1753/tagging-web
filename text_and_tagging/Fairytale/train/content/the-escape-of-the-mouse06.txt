' we will try it , ' said manawyddan . they began to make shields , and fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen . these likewise they enamelled . and so greatly did they prosper that no man in the town bought a shield except they had made it . the shield - makers banded together as the saddlers had done , and resolved to slay them . but of this they had warning , and by night betook themselves to another town . ' let us take to making shoes , ' said manawyddan , ' for there are not any among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us . ' ' i know nothing of making shoes , ' answered pryderi , who in truth despised so peaceful a craft . ' but i know , ' replied manawyddan , ' and i will teach thee to stitch . we will buy the leather ready dressed , and will make the shoes from it . '
