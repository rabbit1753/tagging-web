the king 's son was going to be married , so there were general rejoicings . he had waited a whole year for his bride , and at last she had arrived . she was a russian princess , and had driven all the way from finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer . the sledge was shaped like a great golden swan , and between the swan 's wings lay the little princess herself . her long ermine - cloak reached right down to her feet , on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue , and she was as pale as the snow palace in which she had always lived . so pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered . " she is like a white rose ! " they cried , and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies .
