" what have you in your basket ? " asked the man . " would you like to know ? " said the woman . " yes , " said the man , " for i have to buy the first thing that comes my way . " " well , if you want to know , buy it ! " said the old woman . " what does it cost ? " asked the man . she must have four shillings for it , declared the woman . this did not seem such a tremendous price to him , he would let it go at that , said he , and raised the cover . and there lay a pup in the basket . when the man got home from his journey to town , there stood the youth full of impatience and curiosity , wondering what his wage for the first year might be . " are you back already , master ? " asked the youth . " yes , indeed , " said his master . " and what have you bought ? " asked the youth . " what i have bought is nothing so very rare , " said the man . " i do n't even know whether i ought to show it to you ; but i bought the first thing to be had , and that was a pup , " said he . " and i thank you most kindly for it , " said the youth . " i have always been fond of dogs . "
