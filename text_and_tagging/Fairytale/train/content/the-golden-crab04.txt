the next morning , when the king awoke , what do you think he saw ? the wall stood there before his eyes , exactly as he had bespoken it ! then the old woman went back to the king and said to him , ' your majesty 's orders have been fulfilled . ' ' that is all very well , ' said the king , ' but i can not give away my daughter until there stands in front of my palace a garden in which there are three fountains , of which the first must play gold , the second diamonds , and the third brilliants . ' so the old woman had to strike again three times upon the ground with the rod , and the next morning the garden was there . the king now gave his consent , and the wedding was fixed for the very next day .
