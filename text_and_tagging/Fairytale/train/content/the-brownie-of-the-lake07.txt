jegu declared that nothing could be easier , and then taking off his hat , he thanked the dwarf heartily , and led his horses back to the farm . next morning was a holiday , and barbaik was awake earlier than usual , as she wished to get through her work as soon as possible , and be ready to start for a dance which was to be held some distance off . she went first to the cow - house , which it was her duty to keep clean , but to her amazement she found fresh straw put down , the racks filled with hay , the cows milked , and the pails standing neatly in a row .
