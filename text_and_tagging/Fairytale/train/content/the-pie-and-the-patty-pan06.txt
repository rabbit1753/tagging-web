when ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish , and went out down the field to the farm , to fetch milk and butter . when she came back , she peeped into the bottom oven ; the pie looked very comfortable . ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket , to the village shop to buy a packet of tea , a pound of lump sugar , and a pot of marmalade . and just at the same time , duchess came out of her house , at the other end of the village . ribby met duchess half - way own the street , also carrying a basket , covered with a cloth . they only bowed to one another ; they did not speak , because they were going to have a party .
