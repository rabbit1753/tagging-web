the spring passed , and it was the eve of st . john , or midsummer day . this was the greatest holiday of the year , when the young girls met in the woods to dance and play . they went to fetch snowflake , and said to marie : ' let her come and dance with us . ' but marie was afraid ; she could not tell why , only she could not bear the child to go . snowflake did not wish to go either , but they had no excuse ready . so marie kissed the girl and said : ' go , my snowflake , and be happy with your friends , and you , dear children , be careful of her . you know she is the light of my eyes to me . ' ' oh , we will take care of her , ' cried the girls gaily , and they ran off to the woods . there they wore wreaths , gathered nosegays , and sang songs some sad , some merry . and whatever they did snowflake did too . when the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass , and placed themselves in a row , snowflake being the last of all . ' now , watch us , ' they said , ' and run just as we do . ' and they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire .
