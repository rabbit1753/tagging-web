" aweel , aweel , ye've seen your fortune , " said the old woman , in a tone of satisfaction , " for that coach - and - six is coming for thee . " sure enough , the coach - and - six stopped at the gate of the castle , and the second princess came running down to the cottage to tell her sister to make haste , because it was waiting for her . delighted beyond measure at the wonderful luck that had come to her , she hurried home , and , saying farewell to her mother and sisters , took her seat within , and the horses galloped off immediately .
