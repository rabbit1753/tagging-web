" indeed i will , " answered the sheep , " for you are always kind and have a pleasant word for me . so you watch until my wool grows again , and then you shall have your share of it . " " oh , thank you ! " said the boy , and he ran away to tell his mother what the black sheep had said . when the farmer came into the field again the black sheep said to him , " master , how many bags of wool did you cut from my back ? " " two bags full , " replied the farmer ; " and it was very nice wool indeed . " " if i grow three bags full the next time , may i have one bag for myself ? " asked the sheep . " why , what could you do with a bag of wool ? " questioned the farmer . " i want to give it to the little boy that lives in the lane . he is very poor and needs a new coat . " " very well , " answered the master ; " if you can grow three bags full i will give one to the little boy . " so the black sheep began to grow wool , and tried in every way to grow the finest and heaviest fleece in all the flock . she always lay in the sunniest part of the pastures , and drank from the clearest part of the brook , and ate only the young and juicy shoots of grass and the tenderest of the sheep - sorrel . and each day the little boy came to the bars and looked at the sheep and enquired how the wool was growing .
