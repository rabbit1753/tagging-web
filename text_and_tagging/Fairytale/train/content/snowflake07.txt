' oh , we will take care of her , ' cried the girls gaily , and they ran off to the woods . there they wore wreaths , gathered nosegays , and sang songs some sad , some merry . and whatever they did snowflake did too . when the sun set they lit a fire of dry grass , and placed themselves in a row , snowflake being the last of all . ' now , watch us , ' they said , ' and run just as we do . ' and they all began to sing and to jump one after another across the fire . suddenly , close behind them , they heard a sigh , then a groan . ' ah ! ' they turned hastily and looked at each other . there was nothing . they looked again . where was snowflake ? she has hidden herself for fun , they thought , and searched for her everywhere . ' snowflake ! snowflake ! ' but there was no answer . ' where can she be ? oh , she must have gone home . ' they returned to the village , but there was no snowflake . for days after that they sought her high and low . they examined every bush and every hedge , but there was no snowflake . and long after everyone else had given up hope ivan and marie would wander through the woods crying ' snowflake , my dove , come back , come back ! ' and sometimes they thought they heard a call , but it was never the voice of snowflake . and what had become of her ? had a fierce wild beast seized her and dragged her into his lair in the forest ? had some bird carried her off across the wide blue sea ? no , no beast had touched her , no bird had borne her away . with the first breath of flame that swept over her when she ran with her friends snowflake had melted away , and a little soft haze floating upwards was all that remained of her .
