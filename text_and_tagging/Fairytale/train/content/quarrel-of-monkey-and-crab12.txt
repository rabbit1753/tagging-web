running crab - fashion up the stony river bank , over the pathways into the shadowy forest , the crab at last found the monkey taking an afternoon nap in his favorite pine - tree , with his tail curled tight around a branch to prevent him from falling off in his dreams . he was soon wide awake , however , when he heard himself called , and eagerly listening to what the crab told him . when he heard that the seed which he had long ago exchanged for a rice - dumpling had grown into a tree and was now bearing good fruit , he was delighted , for he at once devised a cunning plan which would give him all the persimmons for himself .
