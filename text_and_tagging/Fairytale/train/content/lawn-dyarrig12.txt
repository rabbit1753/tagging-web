" he has some way of coaxing my men to delay , " said the knight . " do you go now , three hundred of my savage hirelings , and bring him . " the three hundred savage hirelings went , and lawn dyarrig let every man of them enter before he raised a hand , then he caught the bulkiest of them all by the two ankles , and began to wallop the others with him , and he walloped them till he drove the life out of the two hundred and ninety - nine . the bulkiest one was worn to the shin - bones that lawn dyarrig held in his two hands . the green knight , who thought lawn dyarrig was coaxing the men , called out then , " come down , my men , and take dinner . " " i 'll be with you , " said lawn dyarrig , " and have the best food in the house , and i 'll have the best bed in the house . god not be good to you for it , either . "
