" what ! " says the king , " is that so ? her kerchief ! golden necklace ! we will have to look into this business . " so off he marched , with his little dog at his heels , to find out what he could about it . up the hill he went to where the gooseherd watched his flock ; and when he came near the hedge where the kissing was going on , he heard them counting-"twenty - one , twenty - two , twenty - three- " and he wondered what in the world they were all about . so he just peeped over the bushes , and there he saw the whole business . mercy on us ! what a rage he was in ! so ; the princess would turn up her nose at folks as good as herself , would she ? and here she was kissing the gooseherd back of the hedge . if he was the kind she liked she should have him for good and all . so the minister was called in , and the princess and the gooseherd were married then and there , and that was the end of the business . then off they were packed to shift for themselves in the wide world , for they were not to live at the king 's castle , and that was the long and the short of it .
