' that 's a lie , ' said walter , ' i am not at all frightened , but it is more amusing when there are two . i only want someone who will see how i strike the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin . ' ' well , then , walter can take the miller 's little lisa with him . she can sit on a stone and look on , ' said jonas . ' no , she would certainly be frightened , ' said walter , ' and how would it do for a girl to go wolf - hunting ? come with me , jonas , and you shall have the skin , and i will be content with the ears and the tail . ' ' no , thank you , ' said jonas , ' walter can keep the skin for himself . now i see quite well that he is frightened . fie , shame on him ! '
