when day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath . " what a remarkable phenomenon , " said the professor of ornithology as he was passing over the bridge . " a swallow in winter ! " and he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper . every one quoted it , it was full of so many words that they could not understand . " to - night i go to egypt , " said the swallow , and he was in high spirits at the prospect . he visited all the public monuments , and sat a long time on top of the church steeple . wherever he went the sparrows chirruped , and said to each other , " what a distinguished stranger ! " so he enjoyed himself very much . when the moon rose he flew back to the happy prince . " have you any commissions for egypt ? " he cried ; " i am just starting . " " swallow , swallow , little swallow , " said the prince , " will you not stay with me one night longer ? "
