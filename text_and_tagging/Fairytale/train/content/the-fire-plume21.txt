wassamo promised obedience to these directions , and , at the appointed time , set out in company with his wife . they traveled on a pleasant course , his wife leading the way , until they reached a rising ground . at the highest point of this ground , she said , " we will soon get to your country . " it suddenly became broad day , as they came upon a high bank ; they passed , unwet , for a short distance under the lake , and presently emerged from the water at the sand - banks , just off the shore where wassamo had set his nets on the night when he had been borne away by the two strange females . he now left his wife sheltered in a neighboring wood , while he advanced toward the village alone . musing sadly , and from time to time breaking forth in mournful cries , as he walked the shore , it was his cousin that wassamo beheld as he turned the first point of land by the lake .
