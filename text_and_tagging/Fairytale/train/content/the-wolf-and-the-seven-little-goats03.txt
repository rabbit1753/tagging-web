then off went the wolf to a shop and bought a big lump of chalk , and ate it up to make his voice soft . and then he came back , knocked at the house - door , and cried , " open the door , my dear children , your mother is here , and has brought each of you something . " but the wolf had put up his black paws against the window , and the kids seeing this , cried out , " we will not open the door ; our mother has no black paws like you ; you must be the wolf . "
