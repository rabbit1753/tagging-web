when the days of mourning were ended , the brother bade his sister put outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother . so the girl put them out , and he took them away , save only a small pot and a vessel in which she could clean her corn . but she had no corn to clean . she sat at home , sad and hungry , when a neighbour knocked at the door . ' my pot has cracked in the fire , lend me yours to cook my supper in , and i will give you a handful of corn in return . ' and the girl was glad , and that night she was able to have supper herself , and next day another woman borrowed her pot , and then another and another , for never were known so many accidents as befell the village pots at that time . she soon grew quite fat with all the corn she earned with the help of her pot , and then one evening she picked up a pumpkin seed in a corner , and planted it near her well , and it sprang up , and gave her many pumpkins .
