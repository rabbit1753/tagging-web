so she took the jewels and locked them up in her kist , and the wedding was put off , and that night the little princess slipped into the black knight 's apartment when he was asleep , and watched all through the long hours by his bedside , singing this song to him in the hope that he would awake and hear it : " seven lang years i served for thee , the glassy hill i clamb for thee . the mantle white i washed for thee , and wilt thou no waken , and turn to me ? " but although she sang it over and over again , as if her heart would burst , he neither listened nor stirred , for the old washerwoman 's potion had made sure of that . next morning , in her great trouble , the little princess broke open the pear , hoping that its contents would help her better than the contents of the apple had done . but in it she found just what she had found before -- a heap of precious stones ; only they were richer and more valuable than the others had been . so , as it seemed the only thing to do , she carried them to the old woman , and bribed her to put the wedding off for yet another day , and allow her to watch that night also by the black prince 's bedside . and the washerwoman did so ; " for , " said she , as she locked away the stones , " i shall soon grow quite rich at this rate . " but , alas ! it was all in vain that the princess spent the long hours singing with all her might : " seven lang years i served for thee , the glassy hill i clamb for thee , the mantle white i washed for thee , and wilt thou no waken , and turn to me ? " for the young prince whom she watched so tenderly , remained deaf and motionless as a stone .
