the following morning , as soon as the king awoke , he remembered his vow . he at once sent for wood and beams , and had a small house or cage built quite close to the castle . the small house was built of great timbers , and protected by strong locks and bolts , so that none could break in ; and a peephole was left in the middle of the wall through which food might be thrust . when everything was completed the king had the wild man led up , placed in the small house , and he himself took and kept the key . there the dwarf had to sit a prisoner , day and night , and the people came afoot and a - horseback to gaze at him . yet no one ever heard him complain , or so much as utter a single word .
