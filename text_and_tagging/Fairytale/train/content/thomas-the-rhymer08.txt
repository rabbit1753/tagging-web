" i am not that blessed lady , as thou thinkest , " she said . " men call me queen , but it is of a far other country ; for i am the queen of fairy - land , and not the queen of heaven . " and certainly it seemed as if what she said were true ; for , from that moment , it was as if a spell were cast over thomas , making him forget prudence , and caution , and common - sense itself . for he knew that it was dangerous for mortals to meddle with fairies , yet he was so entranced with the lady 's beauty that he begged her to give him a kiss . this was just what she wanted , for she knew that if she once kissed him she had him in her power . and , to the young man 's horror , as soon as their lips had met , an awful change came over her . for her beautiful mantle and riding - skirt of silk seemed to fade away , leaving her clad in a long grey garment , which was just the colour of ashes . her beauty seemed to fade away also , and she grew old and wan ; and , worst of all , half of her abundant yellow hair went grey before his very eyes . she saw the poor man 's astonishment and terror , and she burst into a mocking laugh . " i am not so fair to look on now as i was at first , " she said , " but that matters little , for thou hast sold thyself , thomas , to be my servant for seven long years . for whoso kisseth the fairy queen must e'en go with her to fairy - land , and serve her there till that time is past . " when he heard these words poor thomas fell on his knees and begged for mercy . but mercy he could not obtain . the elfin queen only laughed in his face , and brought her dapple - grey palfrey close up to where he was standing .
