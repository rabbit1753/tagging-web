once upon a time there lived a king , like many others . he had three daughters , who were young and beautiful to such a degree that it would have been difficult to have found handsomer maidens . yet there was a great difference among them ; for the two older sisters were haughty in their thoughts and manners ; while the youngest was sweet and friendly , and everyone liked her . besides , she was fair as the day and delicate as the snow , and far more beautiful than either of her sisters .
