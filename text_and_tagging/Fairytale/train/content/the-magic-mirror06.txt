now gopani - kufa had a wasp called zengi - mizi . zengi - mizi was not an ordinary wasp , for the spirit of the father of gopani - kufa had entered it , so that it was exceedingly wise . in times of doubt gopani - kufa always consulted the wasp as to what had better be done , so on this occasion he took it out of the little rush basket in which he carried it , saying : ' zengi - mizi , what gift shall i ask of insato to - morrow when he would know the reward he shall bestow on me for saving his life ? ' ' biz - z - z , ' hummed zengi - mizi , ' ask him for sipao the mirror . ' and it flew back into its basket .
