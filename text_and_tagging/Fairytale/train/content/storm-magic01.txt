the cabin - boy had been traveling around all summer long with his captain ; but when they began to prepare to set sail in the fall , he grew restless and did not want to go along . the captain liked him , for though he was no more than a boy , he was quite at home on deck , was a big , tall lad , and did not mind lending a hand when need arose ; then , too , he did as much work as an able seaman , and was so full of fun that he kept the whole crew in good humor . and so the captain did not like to lose him . but the youth said out and out that he was not minded to take to the blue pond in the fall ; though he was willing to stay on board till the ship was loaded and ready to sail . one sunday , while the crew was ashore , and the captain had gone to a farm - holding near the forest , in order to bargain for small timber and log wood -- presumably on his own account -- for a deck load , the youth had been left to guard the ship . but you must know that he was a sunday child , and had found a four - leaf clover ; and that was the reason he had the second sight . he could see those who are invisible , but they could not see him .
