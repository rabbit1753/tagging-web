once upon a time there was a king who took such a joy in the chase , that he knew no greater pleasure than hunting wild beasts . early and late he camped in the forest with hawk and hound , and good fortune always followed his hunting . but it chanced one day that he could rouse no game , although he had tried in every direction since morning . and then , when evening was coming on , and he was about to ride home , he saw a dwarf or wild man running through the forest before him . the king at once spurred on his horse , rode after the dwarf , seized him and he was surprised at his strange appearance ; for he was small and ugly , like a troll , and his hair was as stiff as bean - straw . but no matter what the king said to him , he would return no answer , nor say a single word one way or another . this angered the king , who was already out of sorts because of his ill - success at the hunt , and he ordered his people to seize the wild man and guard him carefully lest he escape . then the king rode home .
