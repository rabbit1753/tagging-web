after a time halvor came to the girls who were washing , and they asked him whether he had seen anything of the west wind , who was to come and dry the clothes for the wedding . " yes , " said halvor . " he is only tearing down a stretch of pine forest , and will soon be here , " and then he asked the way to soria - moria castle . they showed it to him , and when he reached the castle it was fairly alive with men and horses . but halvor was so tattered and torn because he had followed the west wind over stick and stone , and through thick and thin , that he kept to one side , and could not come forward until the last day of the feast .
