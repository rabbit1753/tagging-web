maidwa seeing that no preparation had been made to entertain the company , said , " are we to have no supper ? " he had no sooner spoken , than forth from a corner stepped the silent kettle , which placed itself by the fire , and began bubbling and boiling quite briskly . presently that was joined by the big talking kettle , which said , addressing itself to maidwa , " master , we shall be ready presently ; " and then , dancing along , came , from still another , the frisky little kettle , which hopped to their side , and took an active part in the preparations for the evening meal . when all was nearly ready , a delicate voice was heard singing in the last corner of the lodge , and keeping up its dainty carol all the way to the fire - place , the fourth kettle joined the three cooks , and they all fell to with all their might , and in the best possible humor , to dispatch their work . it was not long before the big kettle advanced toward maidwa , and said , in his own confident way , " supper is ready ! " the feast was a jovial one ; and although they were all hungry , and plied their ladles with right good will , yet , dip in as often as they would , the four magic kettles held out , and had plenty to the end of the revel . to draw to a close , maidwa and his friends lived in peace for a time ; their town prospered ; there was no lack of children ; and every thing else was in abundance .
