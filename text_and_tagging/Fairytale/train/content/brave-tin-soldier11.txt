the fish swam to and fro , making the most wonderful movements , but at last he became quite still . after a while , a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him , and then the daylight approached , and a voice cried out , " i declare here is the tin soldier . " the fish had been caught , taken to the market and sold to the cook , who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife . she picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb , and carried him into the room . they were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish ; but he was not at all proud . they placed him on the table , and -- how many curious things do happen in the world!--there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen , there were the same children , the same playthings , standing on the table , and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door ; she still balanced herself on one leg , and held up the other , so she was as firm as himself .
