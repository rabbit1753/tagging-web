" oh , my suffering and sorrow ! " cried the knight . " i 'll never take another bite or sup till i eat some of his liver and heart . let three hundred heroes , fresh and young , go back and bring his heart to me , with the liver and lights , till i eat them . " the three hundred heroes went , and hardly were they behind in the chamber when lawn dyarrig had them all dead in one heap . " he must have some exercise to delay my men , they are so long away , " said the knight . " let three hundred more heroes go for his heart , with the liver and lights , and bring them here to me . " the second three hundred went , and as they were entering the chamber lawn dyarrig was making a heap of them , till the last one was inside , where there were two heaps .
