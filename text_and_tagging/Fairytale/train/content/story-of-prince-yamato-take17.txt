this was the moment for which the brave prince had been waiting . flinging down the wine jar , he seized the tipsy and astonished kumaso and quickly stabbed him to death with the dagger which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast . takeru , the brigand 's brother , was terror - struck as soon as he saw what was happening and tried to escape , but prince yamato was too quick for him . ere he could reach the tent door the prince was at his heel , his garments were clutched by a hand of iron , and a dagger flashed before his eyes and he lay stabbed to the earth , dying but not yet dead . " wait one moment ! " gasped the brigand painfully , and he seized the prince 's hand . yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said . " why should i pause , thou villain ? " the brigand raised himself fearfully and said : " tell me from whence you come , and whom i have the honor of addressing ? hitherto i believed that my dead brother and i were the strongest men in the land , and that there was no one who could overcome us . alone you have ventured into our stronghold , alone you have attacked and killed us ! surely you are more than mortal ?
