' down , caro ! you ought to be rather ashamed to have put such a great hero to flight ! ' walter got up feeling very foolish . ' down , caro ! ' he said , both relieved and annoyed . ' it was only a dog , then if it had been a wolf i certainly should have killed him .... ' ' if walter would listen to my advice , and boast a little less , and do a little more , ' said jonas , consolingly . ' walter is not a coward , is he ? ' ' i ! you shall see , jonas , when we next meet a bear . you see i like so much better to fight with bears . ' ' indeed ! ' laughed jonas . ' are you at it again ? ' ' dear walter , remember that it is only cowards who boast . a really brave man never talks of his bravery . '
