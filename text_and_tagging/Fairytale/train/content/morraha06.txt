and he went to sleep , and there was heavy sleep on him , and morraha went in and took hold of the sword that was on the bed at his head . and the sword thought to draw itself out of the hand of morraha , but it failed . and then it gave a cry , and it wakened niall , and niall said it was a rude and rough thing to come into his house like that . morraha said to him : " leave your much talking , or i will cut the head off you . tell me the news of the death of anshgayliacht . " " oh , you can have my head . " " but your head is no good to me . tell me the story . " " oh , " said niall 's wife , " you must get the story . " " oh , " said morraha , " is the woman your wife ? " " oh , " said the man , " is it not you that have the story ? " " oh , " said she , " you will tell it to us . " " well , " said the man , " let us sit down together till i tell the story . i thought no one would ever get it , but now it will be heard by all . " when i was growing up my mother taught me the language of the birds , and when i got married i used to be listening to their conversation . i would be laughing , and my wife would be asking me what was the reason of my laughing . i did not like to tell her , as women are always asking questions . we went out walking one fine morning , and the birds were arguing with one another . one of them said to another : " why should you be making comparison with me , when there is not a king nor knight that does not come to look at my tree ?
