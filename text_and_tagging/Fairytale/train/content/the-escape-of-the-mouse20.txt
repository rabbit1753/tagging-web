' it is a marvel , truly , ' said she , ' yet it would be unseemly for a man of thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this . do not meddle with it , but let it go . ' ' woe betide me , ' he cried , ' if i would not hang them all if i could catch them , and such as i have i will hang . ' ' verily , ' said she , ' there is no reason i should succour this reptile , except to prevent discredit unto thee . ' ' if i knew any cause that i should succour it , i would take thy counsel , ' answered manawyddan , ' but i know of none . i am minded to destroy it . ' ' do so then , ' said kieva . ' i am about to hang a thief that i caught robbing me ! ' ' what manner of thief is that ? ' inquired the scholar . ' i see a creature in thy hand like upon a mouse , and ill does it become a man of thy rank to touch a reptile like this . let it go free . ' ' i will not let it go free , ' cried manawyddan . ' i caught it robbing me , and it shall suffer the doom of a thief . ' ' lord ! ' said the scholar , ' sooner than see a man like thee at such a work . i would give thee a pound which i have received as alms to let it go free . ' ' i will not let it go free , neither will i sell it . ' ' as thou wilt , lord , ' answered the scholar , and he went his way .
