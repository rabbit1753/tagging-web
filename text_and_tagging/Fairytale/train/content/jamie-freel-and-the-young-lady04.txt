while they rode off , disappointed , jamie freel lifted the latch and went in . " jamie man ! " cried his mother , " you 've been away all night . what have they done on you ? " " naething bad , mother . i have the very best of gude luck . here 's a beautiful young lady i hae brought you for company . " " bless us and save us ! " exclaimed his mother . for some minutes she was so astonished she could not think of anything else to say . jamie told the story of the night 's adventure , ending by saying , " surely you wouldna have allowed me to let her gang with them to be lost for ever ? " " but a lady , jamie ! how can a lady eat we'er ( our ) poor diet and live in we'er poor way ? i ax you that , you foolitch fellow ! " " well , mother , sure it 's better for her to be over here nor yonder , " and he pointed in the direction of the castle . meanwhile the deaf and dumb girl shivered in her light clothing , stepping close to the humble turf fire . " poor crathur , she 's quare and handsome ! nae wonder they set their hearts on her , " said the old woman , gazing at their guest with pity and admiration . " we maun dress her first . what in the name of fortune have i fit for the likes of her to wear ? " she went to her press in " the room " and took out her sunday gown of brown drugget . she then opened a drawer and drew forth a pair of white stockings , a long snowy garment of fine linen , and a cap , her " dead dress , " as she called it .
