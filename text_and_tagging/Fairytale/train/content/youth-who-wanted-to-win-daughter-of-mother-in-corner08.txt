when he stood before the door at home , he turned around ; and there lay many , many hundred yards of the finest linen , finer than the most skillful weaver could have spun . " mother , come out , come out ! " called and cried the youth . his mother came darting out , and asked what was the matter . and when she saw the linen , stretching as far as she could see , and then a bit , she could not believe her eyes , until the youth told her how it all happened . but when she had heard that , and had tested the linen between her fingers , she was so pleased that she , too , began to sing and dance . then she took the linen , cut it , and sewed shirts from it for her son and herself . the remainder she took to town and sold for a good price . then for a time they lived in all joy and comfort . but when that was over the woman had not a bite to eat in the house . she told her son that it was the highest time for him to take service , and really do something , or else both of them would have to starve to death .
