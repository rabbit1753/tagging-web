' these are my children ! ' said insato , waving his hand towards the people . gopani - kufa was much astonished at all that he saw , but he said nothing . presently they came to the town ; everything here , too , was beautiful , and everything that a man might desire he could obtain . even the grains of dust in the streets were of gold and silver . insato conducted gopani - kufa to the palace , and showing him his rooms , and the maidens who would wait upon him , told him that they would have a great feast that night , and on the morrow he might name his choice of the riches of pita and it should be given him . then he was away .
