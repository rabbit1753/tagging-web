duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat ; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for ribby ; and passed the time until the clock struck four . ribby -- having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder -- went upstairs to change her dress . she put on a lilac silk gown , for the party , and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet . " it is very strange , " said ribby , " i did not think i left that drawer pulled out ; has somebody been trying on my mittens ? " she came downstairs again , and made the tea , and put the teapot on the hob . she peeped again into the bottom oven , the pie had become a lovely brown , and it was steaming hot . she sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog . " i am glad i used the bottom oven , " said ribby , " the top one would certainly have been very much too hot . i wonder why that cupboard door was open ? can there really have been some one in the house ?
