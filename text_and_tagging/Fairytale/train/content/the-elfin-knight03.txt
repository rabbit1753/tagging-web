" i have heard tell , however , that one is safe from any power that the knight may have if one wearest the sign of the blessed trinity . so let us bind that on our arm and ride forth without fear . " sir gregory burst into a loud laugh at these words . " dost thou think that i am one of the bairns , " he said , " first to be frightened by an idle tale , and then to think that a leaf of clover will protect me ? no , no , carry that sign if thou wilt ; i will trust to my good bow and arrow . " but earl st . clair did not heed his companion 's words , for he remembered how his mother had told him , when he was a little lad at her knee that whoso carried the sign of the blessed trinity need never fear any spell that might be thrown over him by warlock or witch , elf or demon . so he went out to the meadow and plucked a leaf of clover , which he bound on his arm with a silken scarf ; then he mounted his horse and rode with earl gregory to the desolate and lonely moorland .
