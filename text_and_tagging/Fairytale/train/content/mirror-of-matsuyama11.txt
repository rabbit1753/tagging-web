time passed away in the peaceful home , and the parents saw their fondest hopes realized as their daughter grew from childhood into a beautiful girl of sixteen . as a gem of priceless value is held in its proud owner 's hand , so had they reared her with unceasing love and care . now their pains were more than doubly rewarded . what a comfort she was to her mother as she went about the house taking her part in the housekeeping , and how proud her father was of her , for she daily reminded him of her mother when he had first married her . but , alas ! in this world nothing lasts forever . even the moon is not always perfect in shape , but loses its roundness with time , and flowers bloom and then fade . so at last the happiness of this family was broken up by a great sorrow . the good and gentle wife and mother was one day taken ill .
