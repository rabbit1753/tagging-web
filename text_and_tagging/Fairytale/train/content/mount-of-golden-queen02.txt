the following day he once more pastured his cattle in the wood . when he came to the same clearing , and again ate his dinner there . and again he saw the rat and went to look for it , and again when he bent down he went head over heels , and fell fast asleep . and again he dreamed of the princess on the mount of the golden queen , and that in order to get her he would need seventy pounds of iron and a pair of iron shoes . he awoke and it was all a dream . by now he had made up his mind to find the mount of the golden queen , and he went home with his herd . on the third day , when he led out his cattle , he could not reach the clearing of his happy dream too soon . again the rat showed itself and when he went to look for it , he fell asleep as he had done each preceding day .
