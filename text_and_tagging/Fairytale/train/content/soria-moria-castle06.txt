" but now , " said she , " you must first help me get this body out . " halvor was very strong , so he quickly cleared everything out , cleaned up , and put all in order . then they ate , and the following morning he started off at dawn . he did not rest for a moment , but wandered all day long . when he spied the castle , he once more felt a little afraid ; it was even handsomer than the other one ; but here , too , there was not a human being to be seen . then halvor went into the kitchen , yet did not stop at all , but stepped right into the next room . " no , it can not be possible that a christian should venture here ! " cried the princess . " i do not know how long i have been here ; but during all that time i have not seen a single christian soul . it would probably be best if you went away quickly ; for a troll with six heads lives here . " " no , i am not going , " said halvor , " not even if he had six heads more . " " he will seize you and swallow you alive ! " said the princess . but that made no difference , halvor would not go , and he did not fear the troll . but he would have to eat and drink , for he was hungry and thirsty after his long tramp . he had as much as he wanted ; and then the princess wanted to send him away again . " no , " cried halvor , " i am not going . i have done no wrong , and need not fear any one . "
