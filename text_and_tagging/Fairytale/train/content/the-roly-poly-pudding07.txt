ribby and tabitha rushed upstairs again . sure enough the roly - poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor . " this is serious , cousin tabitha , " said ribby . " we must send for john joiner at once , with a saw . " now this is what had been happening to tom kitten , and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house , where a person does not know his way , and where there are enormous rats . tom kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard . when he saw that his mother was going to bake , he determined to hide . he looked about for a nice convenient place , and he fixed upon the chimney . the fire had only just been lighted , and it was not hot ; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks . tom kitten got upon the fender and looked up . it was a big old - fashioned fireplace .
