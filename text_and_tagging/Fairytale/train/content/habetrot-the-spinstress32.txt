she looked so lovely in her fresh morning gown of blue gingham , with her auburn hair curling softly round her brow , and her face all over blushes at the sight of such a gallant young man , that he quite lost his heart , and fell in love with her on the spot . " ah , " said he , " my dear mother always told me to try and find a wife who was both pretty and useful , and i have succeeded beyond my expectations . do not let our marriage , i pray thee , good dame , be too long deferred . " maisie 's mother was overjoyed , as you may imagine , at this piece of unexpected good fortune , and busied herself in getting everything ready for the wedding ; but maisie herself was a little perplexed . she was afraid that she would be expected to spin a great deal when she was married and lived at the castle , and if that were so , her husband was sure to find out that she was not really such a good spinstress as he thought she was . in her trouble she went down , the night before her wedding , to the great boulder by the stream in the glen , and , climbing up on it , she laid her head against the stone , and called softly down the hole , " habetrot , dear habetrot . " the little old woman soon appeared , and , with twinkling eyes , asked her what was troubling her so much just when she should have been so happy . and maisie told her . " trouble not thy pretty head about that , " answered the fairy , " but come here with thy bridegroom next week , when the moon is full , and i warrant that he will never ask thee to sit at a spinning - wheel again .
