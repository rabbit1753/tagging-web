then the young prince answered with a proud smile:-"i am the son of the king and my name is yamato , and i have been sent by my father as the avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels ! no longer shall robbery and murder hold my people in terror ! " and he held the dagger dripping red above the rebel 's head . " ah , " gasped the dying man with a great effort , " i have often heard of you . you are indeed a strong man to have so easily overcome us . allow me to give you a new name . from henceforth you shall be known as yamato take . our title i bequeath to you as the bravest man in yamato . " and with these noble words , takeru fell back and died . the prince having thus successfully put an end to his father 's enemies in the world , was prepared to return to the capital . on the way back he passed through the province of idum . here he met with another outlaw named idzumo takeru who he knew had done much harm in the land . he again resorted to stratagem , and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name . having done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword . this he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion when he expected to meet the third robber takeru . he now invited takeru to the bank of the river hinokawa , and persuaded him to try a swim with him in the cool refreshing waters of the river .
