wassamo dropped his head and made no answer . the thought that he should behold his kindred no more , made him sad . he was silent , and the old spirit continued : " your wants will all be supplied ; but you must be careful not to stray far from the lodge . i am afraid of that spirit who rules all islands lying in the lakes . he is my bitter enemy , for i have refused him my daughter in marriage ; and when he learns that you are a member of my family , he will seek to harm you . there is my daughter , " added the old spirit , pointing toward her . " take her . she shall be your wife . " forthwith wassamo and the old spirit 's daughter sat near each other in the lodge , and they were man and wife . one evening the old spirit came in after a busy day 's work out among the sand - hills , in the course of which he had blown them all out of shape with great gusts of wind , and strewn them about in a thousand directions , and brought them back and piled them up in all sorts of misshapen heaps .
