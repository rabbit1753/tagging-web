when the king 's youngest son had put an end to the giant in this way , he rode back on his wolf to the giant 's home . there stood his six brothers as much alive as ever they had been , together with , their brides . then the prince went into the hill to get his own bride , and they all rode home together . and great was the joy of the old king when his seven sons all returned , each with his bride . " but the bride of my youngest is the most beautiful , after all , and he shall sit with her at the head of the table ! " said the king . and then they had a feast that lasted for weeks , and if they have not stopped , they are feasting to this very day .
