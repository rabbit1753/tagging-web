his life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents . he fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong . then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more . the princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen . ' you will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly . but uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ' only this once will i leave you , and then will i return to your side for ever . ' sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ' one way there is to bring you safely back , but i fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . '
