now sorrow unheard of reigned among the people , and all pleaded for the little prince . but the king 's word could not be recalled . his serving - men did not dare disobey , took the boy in their midst , and set forth . and when they had gone a long way into the forest , they saw a swine - herd tending his pigs . then one said to another : " it does not seem right to me to lay hand on the king 's son ; let us buy a pig instead and take its heart , then all will believe it is the heart of the prince . " the other serving - men thought that he spoke wisely , so they bought a pig from the swine - herd , led it into the wood , butchered it and took its heart . then they told the prince to go his way and never return . they themselves went back to the king 's castle , and it is easy to imagine what grief they caused when they told of the prince 's death .
