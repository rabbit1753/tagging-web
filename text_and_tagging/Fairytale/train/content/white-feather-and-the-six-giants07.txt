the next morning he ran with the second giant , whom he also outran , killed and beheaded . he went on in this way for the five mornings , always conquering by the aid of his vine , and lopping off the heads of the vanquished giants . the last of the giants who was yet to run with him acknowledged his power , but prepared secretly to deceive him . by way of parley , he proposed that white feather should leave the heads with him , and that he would give him a handsome start for odds . this white feather declined , as he preferred to keep the heads as trophies of his victory . before going to the giant 's lodge , on the sixth morning , he met his old counselor in the woods , standing rooted in the earth , as before . he told white feather that he was about to be deceived ; that he had never known any other sex but his own , but that as he went on his way to the lodge he would meet the most beautiful woman in the world . he must pay no attention to her , but as soon as he caught her eye he must wish himself changed into an elk . the change would take place immediately , and he must go to feeding and not look at her again . white feather thanked his kind adviser , and when he turned to take his leave he was gone as before .
