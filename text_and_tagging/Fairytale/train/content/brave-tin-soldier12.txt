it touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears , but he kept them back . he only looked at her and they both remained silent . presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier , and threw him into the stove . he had no reason for doing so , therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff - box . the flames lighted up the tin soldier , as he stood , the heat was very terrible , but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell . then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform , but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow , no one could say . he looked at the little lady , and she looked at him . he felt himself melting away , but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder .
