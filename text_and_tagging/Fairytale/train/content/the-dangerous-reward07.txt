the man returned home . yet , in about a year 's time nearly all his children had died . in the terror of his heart he turned to the lord of the great mountain . he beat on the tree ; the red - coat came and led him into the palace . there he told of his misfortune and begged the god to protect him . the lord of the mountain smiled : " did i not tell you in the start that the quick and the dead tread different paths , and that it is not well if they abide near each other permanently ? now you see what has happened ! " yet he sent his messenger to fetch the man 's father . the father came and the god spake to him as follows : " i forgave you your offense and sent you back to your home as a field - god . it was your duty to bring happiness to your family . instead , nearly all of your grand - children have died off . why is this ? "
