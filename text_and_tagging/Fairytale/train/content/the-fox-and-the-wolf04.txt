about a week passed by : then one day the fox came into the cave , and flung himself down on the ground as if he were very much exhausted . but if anyone had looked at him closely they would have seen a sly twinkle in his eye . " oh , dear , oh , dear ! " he sighed . " life is a heavy burden . " " what have befallen you ? " asked the wolf , who was ever kind and soft - hearted . " some friends of mine , who live over the hills yonder , are wanting me to go to a christening to - night . just think of the distance that i must travel . " " but do you need to go ? " asked the wolf . " can you not send an excuse ? " " i doubt that no excuse would be accepted , " answered the fox , " for they asked me to stand god - father . therefore it behoveth me to do my duty , and pay no heed to my own feelings . "
