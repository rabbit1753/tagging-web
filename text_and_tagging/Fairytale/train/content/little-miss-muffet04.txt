perhaps you think that miss muffet , surrounded by every luxury and with a dozen servants to wait upon her , was happy and contented ; but such was not the case . she wanted to run and romp , but they told her it was unladylike ; she wished to play with other children , but none were rich enough to be proper associates for her ; she longed to dig in the dirt in the garden , but nurse holloweg was shocked at the very thought . so miss muffet became sullen and irritable , and scolded everyone about her , and lived a very unhappy life . and her food was too rich and gave her dyspepsia , so that she grew thin and pale and did not sleep well at night .
