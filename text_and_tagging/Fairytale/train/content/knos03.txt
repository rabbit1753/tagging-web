knos received his suits and swords , went to a knight 's estate , and hired himself out as a serving - man . once he was told to go to the forest to gather firewood with the rest of the men , but sat at the table eating long after the others had driven off and when he had at last satisfied his hunger and was ready to start , he saw the two young oxen he was to drive waiting for him . but he let them stand and went into the forest , seized the two largest trees growing there , tore them out by the roots , took one tree under each arm , and carried them back to the estate . and he got there long before the rest , for they had to chop down the trees , saw them up and load them on the carts .
