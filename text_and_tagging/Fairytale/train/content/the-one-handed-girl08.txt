in the evening her husband returned from hunting a long way off , and found his wife in tears . ' what is the matter ? ' asked he . ' i sent a slave with some grain to your sister to buy some pumpkins , but she would not sell me any , and told me there were none , though i know she lets other people buy them . ' ' well , never mind now -- go to sleep , ' said he , ' and to - morrow i will go and pull up the pumpkin tree , and that will punish her for treating you so badly . ' so before sunrise he got up and set out for his sister 's house , and found her cleaning some corn .
