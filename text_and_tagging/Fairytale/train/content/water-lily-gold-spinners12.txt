at midday the prince and his men came to a deep river , spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time . the horse on which the prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by . the horse in its fright suddenly reared , and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below . the prince tried to jump in after her , but his men held him back , and in spite of his struggles led him home , where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber , and would neither eat nor drink , so great was his grief . at last he became so ill his life was despaired of , and in great alarm the king caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned . but none could cure him . at last the wind wizard 's son said to the king : " send for the old wizard from finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together . " a messenger was at once sent to finland , and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings of the wind . " honored king , " said the wizard , " the wind has blown this illness upon your son , and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved . this is what makes him grieve so constantly . let the wind blow upon him that it may blow away his sorrow . " then the king made his son go out into the wind , and he gradually recovered and told his father all . " forget the maiden , " said the king , " and take another bride " ; but the prince said he could never love another .
