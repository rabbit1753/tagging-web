with these words he went quietly up the back stairs to the garret , where the student lived . the student 's candle was burning still , and the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book which he had bought out of the shop . but how light the room was ! from the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full like the stem of a tree , from which bright rays spread upward and over the student 's head . each leaf was fresh , and each flower was like a beautiful female head -- some with dark and sparkling eyes and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear . the fruit gleamed like stars , and the room was filled with sounds of beautiful music . the little goblin had never imagined , much less seen or heard of , any sight so glorious as this . he stood still on tiptoe , peeping in , till the light went out . the student no doubt had blown out his candle and gone to bed , but the little goblin remained standing there , listening to the music which still sounded , soft and beautiful -- a sweet cradle song for the student who had lain down to rest .
