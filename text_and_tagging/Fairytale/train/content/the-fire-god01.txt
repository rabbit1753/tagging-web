long before the time of fu hi , dschu yung , the magic welder , was the ruler of men . he discovered the use of fire , and succeeding generations learned from him to cook their food . hence his descendants were intrusted with the preservation of fire , while he himself was made the fire - god . he is a personification of the red lord , who showed himself at the beginning of the world as one of the five ancients . the fire - god is worshiped as the lord of the holy southern mountain . in the skies the fiery star , the southern quarter of the heavens and the red bird belong to his domain . when there is danger of fire the fiery star glows with a peculiar radiance . when countless numbers of fire - crows fly into a house , a fire is sure to break out in it .
