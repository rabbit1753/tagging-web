a similar experience befell a man and his wife who lived in a hut known as ingas , below mosled . they were no more than an hour ahead of time ; but when they reached the church at hanger , they thought the service had already begun , and wanted to enter at once ; but the church was barred and bolted , and the phantom service of the dead was nearing its end . and when the actual mass began , there was found lying at every place some of the earth from the graves of those who shortly before had been worshiping . the man and his wife thereupon fell grievously ill , because they had disturbed the dead .
