' but where are you ? ' inquired jegu . 'look close , and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little green frog . i can take , ' he added proudly , ' any shape i choose , and even , which is much harder , be invisible if i want to . ' ' then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally appear , ' replied jegu . ' certainly , if you wish , ' and the frog jumped on the back of one of the horses , and changed into a little dwarf , all dressed in green .
