" ho ! ho ! who is there ? " cried the wicked father , making his appearance at the opening and looking down . " it is i , onwee bahmondang ! " cried ko - koor , thinking to frighten the wicked father . " ah ! it is you , is it ? i will be there presently , " called the old man . " do not be in haste to go away ! " ko - ko , observing that the old man was in earnest , scrambled up from the ground , and set off promptly at his highest rate of speed . when he looked back and saw that the wicked father was gaining upon him , ko - koor mounted a tree , as had onwee bahmondang before , and fired off a number of arrows , but as they were no more than common arrows , he got nothing by it , but was obliged to descend , and run again for life . as he hurried on he encountered the skeleton of a moose , into which he would have transformed himself , but not having the slightest confidence in any one of all the guardians who should have helped him , he passed on . the wicked father was hot in pursuit , and ko - koor was suffering terribly for lack of wind , when luckily he remembered the enchanted moccasins . he could not send them to the end of the earth , as had onwee bahmondang .
