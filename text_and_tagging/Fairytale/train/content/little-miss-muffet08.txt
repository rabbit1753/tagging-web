" i 'll catch on behind , " said miss muffet , gleefully , " just as i 've seen the boys do in the city . wo n't it be fun ! " so she ran and caught on the end of the cart , and actually climbed into it , falling all in a heap upon the straw that lay upon the bottom . but it did n't hurt her at all , and the next minute the farmer whipped up his horses , and they went trotting along the lane , carrying miss muffet farther and farther away from hated nurse holloweg and the dreadful maids . she looked around upon the green fields and the waving grain , and drew in deep breaths of the fresh country air , and was happy for almost the first time in her little life . by and by she lay back upon the straw and fell asleep ; and the farmer , who did not know she was in his cart , drove on for many miles , until at last he stopped at a small wooden farm - house , and jumped to the ground .
