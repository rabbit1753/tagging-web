in the midst of the wedding festivities , when the king and his whole court were seated at table , the door opened , and in came silverwhite with his dogs . the youth stepped boldly into the hall of state and greeted the king . and when the three princesses saw who it was , they were full of joy , leaped up from their places , and ran over to him , much to the king 's surprise , who asked what it all meant . then the youngest princess told him all that had happened , from beginning to end , and that silverwhite had rescued them , while the courtier sat in a tree . to prove it beyond any chance of doubt , each of the king 's daughters showed her father the ring she had wound in silverwhite 's locks . but the king still did not know quite what to think of it all , until silverwhite said : " my lord king ! in order that you need not doubt what your daughters have told you , i will show you the eyes of the sea - trolls whom i slew . " then the king and all the rest saw that the princesses had told the truth . the traitorous courtier received his just punishment . silverwhite was paid every honor , and was given the youngest daughter and half of the kingdom with her .
