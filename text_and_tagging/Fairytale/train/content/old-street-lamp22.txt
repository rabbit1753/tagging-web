the lamp burned through the whole evening and began to perceive too clearly that the gift of the stars would remain a hidden treasure all its life . then it had a dream ; for to one with its faculties , dreaming was not difficult . it dreamed that the old people were dead and that it had been taken to the iron foundry to be melted down . this caused the lamp quite as much anxiety as on the day when it had been called upon to appear before the mayor and the council at the town hall . but though it had been endowed with the power of falling into decay from rust when it pleased , it did not make use of this power . it was therefore put into the melting furnace and changed into as elegant an iron candlestick as you could wish to see -- one intended to hold a wax taper . the candlestick was in the form of an angel holding a nosegay , in the center of which the wax taper was to be placed . it was to stand on a green writing table in a very pleasant room , where there were many books scattered about and splendid paintings on the walls .
