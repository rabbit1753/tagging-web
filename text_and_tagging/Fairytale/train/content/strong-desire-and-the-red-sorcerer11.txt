as they were sitting in the lodge , surrounded by the friends and relatives , the mother of the red head regarded the face of her new daughter - in - law for a long time with fixed attention . from this scrutiny she was convinced that this singular and hasty marriage boded no good to her son . she drew him aside , and disclosed to him her suspicions . this can be no female , said she ; she has the figure and manners , the countenance , and more especially the eyes , are beyond a doubt those of a man . her husband rejected her suspicions , and rebuked her severely for entertaining such notions of her own daughter - in - law . she still urged her doubts , which so vexed the husband that he broke his pipe - stem in her face , and called her an owl . this act astonished the company , who sought an explanation ; and it was no sooner given , than the mock bride , rising with an air of offended dignity , informed the red head that after receiving so gross an affront from his relatives she could not think of remaining with him as his wife , but should forthwith return to her own friends .
