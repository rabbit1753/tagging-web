all would have gone well if farquhar had only looked where he was going . he did not , being deeply engaged in making love to a young fairy maiden by his side , so he never saw a cottage that was standing right in his way . he struck against the chimney and stuck fast in the thatch . his companions sped merrily on , not noticing what had befallen him . he was left to disentangle himself as best he could . as he was doing so he chanced to glance down the wide chimney . in the cottage kitchen he saw a comely young woman dandling a rosy - cheeked baby .
