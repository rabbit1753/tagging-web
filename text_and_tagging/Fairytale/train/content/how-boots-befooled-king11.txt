but boots was not going to fall into any such trap as that ! no indeed ! not he ! the next morning he went quietly and bought a fine large meal - sack . then he put a black wig over his beautiful red hair , so that no one might know him . after that he went to the place where the high - councillor lived , and when he had come there he crawled inside of the sack , and lay just beside the door of the house . by and by came one of the maid servants to the door , and there lay the great meal - sack with somebody in it . " ach ! " cried she , " who is there ? " but boots only said , " sh - h - h - h - h ! " then the serving maid went back into the house , and told the high - councillor that one lay outside in a great meal - sack , and that all that he said was , " sh - h - h - h - h ! " so the councillor went himself to see what it was all about . " what do you want here ? " said he . " sh - h - h - h - h ! " said boots , " i am not to be talked to now . this is a wisdom - sack , and i am learning wisdom as fast as a drake can eat peas . "
