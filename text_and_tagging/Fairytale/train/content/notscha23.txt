finally they called notscha in to them and ordered him to be reconciled to his father . then they dismissed them both and seated themselves to play chess . but no sooner was notscha free than he again fell into a rage , and renewed his pursuit of his father . he had again overtaken li dsing when still another saint came forward to defend the latter . this time it was the old buddha of the radiance of the light . when notscha attempted to battle with him he raised his arm , and a pagoda shaped itself out of red , whirling clouds and closed around notscha . then radiance of light placed both his hands on the pagoda and a fire arose within it which burned notscha so that he cried loudly for mercy . then he had to promise to beg his father 's forgiveness and always to obey him in the future . not till he had promised all this did the buddha let him out of the pagoda again . and he gave the pagoda to li dsing ; and taught him a magic saying which would give him the mastery over notscha . it is for this reason that li dsing is called the pagoda - bearing king of heaven .
