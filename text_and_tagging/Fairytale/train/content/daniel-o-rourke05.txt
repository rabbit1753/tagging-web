' dan , ' says he , after a minute 's thought , ' though it is very improper of you to get drunk on a lady - day , yet , as you are a decent sober man , who tends mass well , and never fling stones at me or mine , nor cries out after one in the field , my life for yours , ' says he ; ' so get up on my back , and grip me well for fear you 'd fall off , and i 'll fly you out of the bog . ' ' i am afraid , ' says i , ' your honour 's making game of me ; for whoever heard of riding a - horseback on an eagle before ? ' ' upon the honour of a gentleman , ' says he , putting his right foot on his breast , ' i am quite in earnest ; and so now either take my offer or starve in the bog -- besides i see that your weight is sinking the stone . ' it was true enough , as he said , for i found the stone every minute going from under me . i had no choice ; so , thinks i to myself , faint heart never won fair lady , and this is fair persuadance . ' i thank your honour , ' says i , ' for the loan of your civility ; and i 'll take your kind offer . ' i therefore mounted on the back of the eagle , and held him tight enough by the throat , and up he flew in the air like a lark .
