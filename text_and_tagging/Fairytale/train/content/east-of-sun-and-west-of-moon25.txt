" o , yes , i know very well where the castle lies , " said the north wind . " i blew an aspen leaf there just once , and then i was so weary that i could not blow at all for many a long day . but if you want to get there above all things , and are not afraid of me , i will take you on my back , and see whether i can blow you there . " the maiden said that she must and would get to the castle , if it were by any means possible . she was not afraid , no matter how hard the journey might be . " very well , then you must stay here over night , " said the north wind . " for if we are to get there to - morrow , we must have the whole day before us . "
