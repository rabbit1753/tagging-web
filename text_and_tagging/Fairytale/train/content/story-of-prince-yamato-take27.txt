the eight - arms - length - spear of the holly tree of those old days , was prized by warriors just as much as the standard or banner is valued by a regiment in these modern days , when given by the king to his soldiers on the occasion of setting out for war . the prince respectfully and with great reverence received the king 's spear , and leaving the capital , marched with his army to the east . on his way he visited first of all the temples of ise for worship , and his aunt the princess of yamato and high priestess came out to greet him . she it was who had given him her robe which had proved such a boon to him before in helping him to overcome and slay the brigands of the west .
