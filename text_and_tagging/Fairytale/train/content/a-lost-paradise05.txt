for many days life went on like a beautiful dream to the charcoal - burner and his wife . their beds were so comfortable , they could hardly make up their minds to get up , and their clothes were so lovely they could scarcely bring themselves to take them off . their dinners were so good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating . then outside the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing birds . if they desired to go further , a golden coach , painted with wreaths of forget - me - nots and lined with blue satin , awaited their orders . sometimes it happened that the king came to see them . he smiled as he glanced at the man , who was getting rosier and plumper each day . but when his eyes rested on the woman , they took on a look which seemed to say ' i knew it , ' though this neither the charcoal - burner nor his wife ever noticed . ' why are you so silent ? ' asked the man one morning when dinner had passed before his wife had uttered one word . ' a little while ago you used to be chattering all the day long . now i have almost forgotten the sound of your voice . '
