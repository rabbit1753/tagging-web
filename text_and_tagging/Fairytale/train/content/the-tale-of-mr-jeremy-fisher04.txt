and while mr . jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat -- sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water -- a much worse thing happened ; a really frightful thing it would have been , if mr . jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh ! a great big enormous trout came up -- ker - pflop - p - p - p ! with a splash -- and it seized mr . jeremy with a snap , " ow ! ow ! ow!"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond ! but the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh , that in less than half a minute it spat him out again ; and the only thing it swallowed was mr . jeremy 's goloshes . mr . jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water , like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle ; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond . he scrambled out on the first bank he came to , and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters .
