perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes , and never lived anywhere except in the water , but if you went to australia and talked to the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country , you would learn something quite different . they would tell you that long , long ago you would have met fishes on the land , wandering from place to place , and hunting all sorts of animals , and if you consider how fishes are made , you will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were to do it . indeed , so clever were they that they might have been hunting still if a terrible thing had not happened .
