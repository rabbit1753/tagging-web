" there was a handsome young man , once , " thought the lamp ; " it is certainly a long while ago , but i remember that he had a little note , written on pink paper with a gold edge . the writing was elegant , evidently a lady 's . twice he read it through , and kissed it , and then looked up at me with eyes that said quite plainly , ' i am the happiest of men ! ' only he and i know what was written on this , his first letter from his lady - love . ah , yes , and there was another pair of eyes that i remember ; it is really wonderful how the thoughts jump from one thing to another ! a funeral passed through the street . a young and beautiful woman lay on a bier decked with garlands of flowers , and attended by torches which quite overpowered my light . all along the street stood the people from the houses , in crowds , ready to join the procession . but when the torches had passed from before me and i could look around , i saw one person standing alone , leaning against my post and weeping . never shall i forget the sorrowful eyes that looked up at me .
