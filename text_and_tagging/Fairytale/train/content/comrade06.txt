" no , " said the youth , he always had something to think about . the man asked whether he did not need a servant . " no , " said the youth , " i am used to serving myself , so i have no need of a servant . no matter how much i might wish for one , i still would have to do without , since i have no money for his keep and pay . " " yet you need a servant , as i know better than you do , " said the man , " and you need one upon whom you can rely in life and death . but if you do not want me for a servant , then let me be your comrade . i promise that you will not lose thereby , and i will not cost you a shilling . i travel at my own expense , nor need you be put to trouble as regards my food and clothing . " under these circumstances the youth was glad to have him for a comrade , and they resumed their journey , the man as a rule going in advance and pointing out the way . after they had wandered long through various lands , over hills and over heaths , they suddenly stood before a wall of rock . the comrade knocked , and begged to be let in . then the rock opened before them , and after they had gone quite a way into the interior of the hill , a witch came to meet them and offered them a chair . " be so good as to sit down , for you must be weary ! " said she .
