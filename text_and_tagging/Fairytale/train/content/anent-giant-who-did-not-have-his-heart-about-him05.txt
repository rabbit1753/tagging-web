now when he had ridden a while he met a raven . he was lying in the road beating his wings , and unable to move from the spot because he was so starved . " o , dear friend , if you will give me a bite to eat , then i 'll help you in your hour of direst need ! " cried the raven . " i have not much food , nor are you likely to be able to help me much , " said the king 's son , " but still i can give you a little , for it is easy to see you need it . " and with that he gave the raven some of the provisions he had with him . and when he had ridden a while longer , he came to a brook . there lay a great salmon who had gotten on dry land , and was threshing about , and could not get back into the water . " o , dear friend , help me back into the water , " said the salmon to the king 's son , " and i will help you , too , in your hour of greatest need ! " " the help you will be able to give me will probably not amount to much , " said the prince , " but it would be a pity if you had to lie there and pine away . " and with that he pushed the fish back into the water . then he rode on a long , long way , and met a wolf . the wolf was so starved that he lay in the middle of the road , and writhed with hunger .
