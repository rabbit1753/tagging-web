as soon as sentaro got down from the bird 's back , the crane folded up of its own accord and flew into his pocket . now sentaro began to look about him wonderingly , curious to see what the country of perpetual life was like . he walked first round about the country and then through the town . everything was , of course , quite strange , and different from his own land . but both the land and the people seemed prosperous , so he decided that it would be good for him to stay there . he took up lodgings at one of the hotels . the proprietor was a kind man . when sentaro told him that he was a stranger and had come to live there , he promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the governor of the city concerning sentaro 's sojourn there . he even found a house for his guest , and in this way sentaro obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country of perpetual life .
