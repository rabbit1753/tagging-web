he sat up slowly and rubbed his eyes , and crossly demanded what his wife was making all that noise about . by the time that the man was alive to what had happened , and they both got outside the gate , the boar had got well away , but they saw the monkey running after the thief as hard as his legs would carry him . both the man and wife were moved to admiration at the plucky conduct of the sagacious monkey , and their gratitude knew no bounds when the faithful monkey brought the child safely back to their arms . " there ! " said the wife . " this is the animal you want to kill - if the monkey had n't been here we should have lost our child forever . " " you are right , wife , for once , " said the man as he carried the child into the house . " you may send the butcher back when he comes , and now give us all a good breakfast and the monkey too . " when the butcher arrived he was sent away with an order for some boar 's meat for the evening dinner , and the monkey was petted and lived the rest of his days in peace , nor did his master ever strike him again .
