there was no time to lose . the monkey slipped out of the house and ran as quickly as he could to the forest to find the boar . the boar was at home , and the monkey began his tale of woe at once . " good mr . boar , i have heard of your excellent wisdom . i am in great trouble , you alone can help me . i have grown old in the service of my master , and because i can not dance properly now he intends to sell me to the butcher . what do you advise me to do ? i know how clever you are !
