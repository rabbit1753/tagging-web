in this way the end came . for the heart of shasasa , the daughter of gopani - kufa , went forth to butou the traitor , and from her he learnt the secret of the magic mirror . one night , when all the town slept , he felt beneath her pillow and , finding the mirror , he stole it and fled back with it to rei , the chief of the white men . so it befell that , one day , as gopani - kufa was gazing up at the river from a window of the palace he again saw the war - canoes of the white men ; and at the sight his spirit misgave him . ' shasasa ! my daughter ! ' he cried wildly , ' go fetch me the mirror , for the white men are at hand . ' ' woe is me , my father ! ' she sobbed . ' the mirror is gone ! for i loved butou the traitor , and he has stolen sipao from me ! '
