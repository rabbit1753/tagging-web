when jack had got his bagpipes he said , ' daddy , do go to the smithy and have the house cock shod for me ; then i 'll ride off and trouble you no more . ' his father , who was delighted at the prospect of getting rid of him , had the cock shod , and when it was ready jack my hedgehog mounted on its back and rode off to the forest , followed by all the pigs and asses which he had promised to look after . having reached the forest he made the cock fly up to the top of a very tall tree with him , and there he sat looking after his pigs and donkeys , and he sat on and on for several years till he had quite a big herd ; but all this time his father knew nothing about him .
