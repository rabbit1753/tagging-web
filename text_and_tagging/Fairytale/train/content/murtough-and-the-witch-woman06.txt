the hue of her hair was like the flower of the iris in summer or like red gold after the burnishing thereof . and she wore on her breasts and at her shoulders marvellous clasps of gold , finely worked with the tracery of the skilled craftsman , and a golden twisted torque around her throat . and when she was decked she went softly and sat down beside murtough on the turfy hunting mound . and after a space murtough perceived her sitting there , and the sun shining upon her , so that the glittering of the gold and of her golden hair and the bright shining of the green silk of her garments , was like the yellow iris - beds upon the lake on a sunny summer 's day . wonder and terror seized on murtough at her beauty , and he knew not if he loved her or if he hated her the most ; for at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her , so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of ireland for the loan of one hour 's space of dalliance with her ; but after that he felt a dread of her , because he knew his fate was in her hands , and that she had come to work him ill .
