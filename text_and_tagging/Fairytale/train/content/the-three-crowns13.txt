' ' oh , ' says the princess , ' it 's only the calf i got killed to - day . ' ' ay , ay , ' says he , ' is supper ready ? ' ' it is , ' says she ; and before he rose from the table he ate three - quarters of a calf , and a flask of wine . ' i think , ' says he , when all was done , ' i smell fresh meat still . ' ' it 's sleepy you are , ' says she ; ' go to bed . ' ' when will you marry me ? ' says the giant . ' you 're putting me off too long . ' ' st . tibb 's eve , ' says she . ' i wish i knew how far off that is , ' says he ; and he fell asleep , with his head in the dish .
