" my beams , " continued the voice , " shine faintly on your lodge , but they have power to transform it into the lightness of the skies , and decorate it with the colors of the clouds . come , osseo , my son , and dwell no longer on earth . think strongly on my words , and look steadfastly at my beams . my power is now at its height . doubt not , delay not . it is the voice of the spirit of the stars that calls you away to happiness and celestial rest . " the words were intelligible to osseo , but his companions thought them some far - off sounds of music , or birds singing in the woods . very soon the lodge began to shake and tremble , and they felt it rising into the air . it was too late to run out , for they were already as high as the tops of the trees . osseo looked around him as the lodge passed through the topmost boughs , and behold ! their wooden dishes were changed into shells of a scarlet color , the poles of the lodge to glittering rods of silver , and the bark that covered them into the gorgeous wings of insects .
