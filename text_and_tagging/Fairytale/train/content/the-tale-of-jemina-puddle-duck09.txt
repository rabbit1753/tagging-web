a moment afterwards there were most awful noises -- barking , baying , growls and howls , squealing and groans . and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy - whiskered gentleman . presently kep opened the door of the shed , and let out jemima puddle - duck . unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them . he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping . jemima puddle - duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs . she laid some more in june , and she was permitted to keep them herself : but only four of them hatched . jemima puddle - duck said that it was because of her nerves ; but she had always been a bad sitter .
