and as they were both very fond of the chase , earl gregory suggested one day that they should go a - hunting on the haunted moor , in spite of the elfin king . " certes , i hardly believe in him at all , " cried the young man , with a laugh . " methinks it is but an old wife 's tale to frighten the bairns withal , lest they go straying amongst the heather and lose themselves . and it is pity that such fine sport should be lost because we -- two bearded men -- pay heed to such gossip . " but earl st . clair looked grave . " it is ill meddling with unchancy things , " he answered , " and it is no bairn 's tale that travellers have set out to cross that moor who have vanished bodily , and never mair been heard of ; but it is , as thou sayest , a pity that so much good sport be lost , all because an elfin knight choosest to claim the land as his , and make us mortals pay toll for the privilege of planting a foot upon it .
