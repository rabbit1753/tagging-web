this odd answer irritated sentaro very much . he thought how foolish it was to waste more time in looking for the hermits in this way . so he decided to go at once to the shrine of jofuku , who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of japan . sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days , entreating jofuku to show him the way to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find .
