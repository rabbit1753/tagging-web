" there 's your tribute ! " said murmur goose - egg , when he had reached the royal castle , and he flung down the knapsack full of money before the king , so that the whole castle tottered . the king thanked him kindly , and promised him a good reward , and a good character , if he wanted it ; but murmur only wanted more work to do . " what shall i do now ? " he asked . the king reflected for a while , and then he said murmur should travel to the hill - troll , who had robbed him of the sword of his ancestors . he lived in a castle by the sea , where no one ventured to go .
