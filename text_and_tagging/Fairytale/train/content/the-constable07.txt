" it was all very strange , " answered the inn - keeper , " and my mother who had been very busy in his house , came home and fell into a violent fever . she was unconscious for a day and a night , and could hardly breathe . " she came to on the very day when the news of sir wang 's death was made public , and said : ' i have been to the nether world and i met him there . he had chains about his neck and several devils were dragging him along . i asked him what he had done , but he said : " i have no time to tell you now . when you return ask my wife and she will tell you all ! " ' and yesterday my mother went there and asked her . and wang 's wife told her with tears : ' my master was an official , but for a long time he did not make any head - way . he was superintendent of the granaries in nanking , and in the same city was a high officer , with whom my master became very intimate .
