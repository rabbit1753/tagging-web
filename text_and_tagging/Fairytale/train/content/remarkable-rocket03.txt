" the world is certainly very beautiful , " cried a little squib . " just look at those yellow tulips . why ! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier . i am very glad i have travelled . travel improves the mind wonderfully , and does away with all one 's prejudices . " " the king 's garden is not the world , you foolish squib , " said a big roman candle ; " the world is an enormous place , and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly . " " any place you love is the world to you , " exclaimed a pensive catherine wheel , who had been attached to an old deal box in early life , and prided herself on her broken heart ; " but love is not fashionable any more , the poets have killed it . they wrote so much about it that nobody believed them , and i am not surprised . true love suffers , and is silent . i remember myself once - but it is no matter now . romance is a thing of the past .
