when the old witch found that she was not to get her crow 's eggs in that way , she tried another , and began using words as sweet as honey . come , come , there should be no hard feeling between them . the prince had served her faithfully , and before he went home with what he had come for he should have a good supper , for it is ill to travel on an empty stomach . so she brought the prince into the house , and then she left him while she went to put the pot on the fire , and to sharpen the bread - knife on the stone door - step . while the prince sat waiting for the witch , there came a tap at the door , and whom should it be but the pretty swan maiden . " come , " said she , " and bring the three eggs with you , for the knife that the old witch is sharpening is for you , and so is the great pot on the fire , for she means to pick your bones in the morning .
