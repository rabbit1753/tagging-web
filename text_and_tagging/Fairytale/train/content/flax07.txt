" i never imagined anything like this when i was only a little blue flower growing in the fields , " said the paper . " how could i know that i should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to men ? i can not understand it myself , and yet it is really so . heaven knows that i have done nothing myself but what i was obliged to do with my weak powers for my own preservation ; and yet i have been promoted from one joy and honor to another . each time i think that the song is ended , and then something higher and better begins for me . i suppose now i shall be sent out to journey about the world , so that people may read me . it can not be otherwise , for i have more splendid thoughts written upon me than i had pretty flowers in olden times . i am happier than ever .
