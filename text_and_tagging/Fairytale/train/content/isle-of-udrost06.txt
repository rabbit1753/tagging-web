when the man opened the door , everything within was so beautiful that isaac could not get over his admiration . he had never seen anything like it . the table was covered with the finest dishes , bowls of cream , and salmon and game , and liver dumplings with syrup , and cheese as well , and there were whole piles of doughnuts , and there was mead , and everything else that is good . isaac ate and drank bravely , and yet his plate was never empty . no matter how much he drank , his glass was always full . the man neither ate much nor said much ; but suddenly they heard a noise and clamor before the house , and the man went out . after a time he returned with his three sons , and isaac trembled inwardly when they came through the door . their father must have quieted them , for they were very friendly and amiable , and told isaac he must use his guest - right , and sit down and drink with them ; for isaac had risen to leave the table , saying he had satisfied his hunger . but he gave in to them , and they drank mead together , and became good friends . and they said that isaac must go fishing with them , so that he would have something to take with him when he went home .
