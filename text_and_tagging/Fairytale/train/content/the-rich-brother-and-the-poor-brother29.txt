' you have killed our father , do you see ? do you see ? ' cried two young men , ' and you will come with us this instant before the judge , and answer for it . ' ' your father ? but i do n't know him . what do you mean ? ' asked the poor man , who was quite bewildered with his sudden rush through the air , and could not think why he should be accused of this fresh crime . but he got no reply , and was only hurried through the streets to the court - house , where his brother , the muleteer , and the farmer had just arrived , all as angry as ever , all talking at once , till the judge entered and ordered them to be silent . ' i will hear you one by one , ' he said , and motioned the younger brother to begin . he did not take long to state his case . the unfinished houses were his , left him with the rest of the property by his father , and his brother refused to give them up . in answer , the poor man told , in a few words , how he had begged the houses from his brother , and produced the deed of gift which made him their owner . the judge listened quietly and asked a few questions ; then he gave his verdict .
