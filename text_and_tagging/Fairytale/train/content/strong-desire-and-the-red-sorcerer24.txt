" you have killed a good many men in your time , red head , " said strong desire , by way of suggesting an agreeable train of ideas to the sorcerer . " hundreds , " answered red head ; " and what is better , now that i am fairly settled in life by this happy marriage , i shall be able to give my whole attention to massacre . "
