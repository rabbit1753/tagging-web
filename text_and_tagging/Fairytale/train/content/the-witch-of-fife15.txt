but he was a sly old man , and the thought of the bishop 's wine gave him no rest . so night after night he went and hid in the old woman 's cottage , in the hope that his wife and her friends would meet there ; and although for a long time it was all in vain , at last his trouble was rewarded . for one evening the whole five old women assembled , and in low tones and with chuckles of laughter they recounted all that had befallen them in lappland . then , running to the fireplace , they , one after another , climbed on a chair and put their feet on the sooty crook . then they repeated the magic words , and , hey , presto ! they were up the lum and away before the old man could draw his breath . " i can do that , too , " he said to himself ; and he crawled out of his hiding - place and ran to the fire . he put his foot on the crook and repeated the words , and up the chimney he went , and flew through the air after his wife and her companions , as if he had been a warlock born .
