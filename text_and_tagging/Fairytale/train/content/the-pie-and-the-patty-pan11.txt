the pie proved extremely toothsome , and the muffins light and hot . they disappeared rapidly , especially the pie ! " i think"--(thought the duchess to herself)--"i think it would be wiser if i helped myself to pie ; though ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it . what very small fine pieces it has cooked into ! i did not remember that i had minced it up so fine ; i suppose this is a quicker oven than my own . " " how fast duchess is eating ! " thought ribby to herself , as she buttered her fifth muffin . the pie - dish was emptying rapidly ! duchess had had four helps already , and was fumbling with the spoon . " a little more bacon , my dear duchess ? " said ribby . " thank you , my dear ribby ; i was only feeling for the patty - pan . " " the patty - pan ? my dear duchess ? " " the patty - pan that held up the pie - crust , " said duchess , blushing under her black coat . " oh , i did n't put one in , my dear duchess , " said ribby ; " i do n't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse . " duchess fumbled with the spoon--"i ca n't find it ! " she said anxiously . " there is n't a patty - pan , " said ribby , looking perplexed . " yes , indeed , my dear ribby ; where can it have gone to ? " said duchess . " there most certainly is not one , my dear duchess . i disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies . it is most undesirable--(especially when people swallow in lumps ! ) " she added in a lower voice .
