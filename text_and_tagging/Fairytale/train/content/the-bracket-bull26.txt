the gentleman brought him home then , and he went herding for him . when the grass was getting scarce , he was driving the cows further out . there was a big stone wall between the land of the giants and his master 's land . there was fine grass on the other side of the wall . when he saw that , he threw down a gap in the wall and let in the pigs and the cows . he went up into a tree then , and was throwing down apples and all sorts ( of fruit ) to the pigs . a giant came out , and when he saw the lad up on the tree throwing down the apples to the pigs , the head rose on him ( i.e. , he got furious ) . he came to the tree . " get down out of that , " says he . " i think you big for one bite and small for two bites ; come down till i draw you under my long cold teeth . " " arrah , take yourself easy , " says the boy ; " perhaps it 's too quick i 'd come down to you . " " i wo n't be talking to you any longer , " says the giant . he got a leverage on the tree and drew it up out of the roots . " go down , black thong , and squeeze that fellow , " says the lad , for he remembered the advice of the bracket bull . on the instant the black thong leaped out of his hand , and squeezed the giant so hard that the two eyes were going out on his head , for stronger was the power of the bull than the power of the giant . the giant was not able to put a stir out of himself , and he promised anything at all -- only to save his life for him . " anything at all you want , " says he to the lad , " you must get it from me . "
