' oh , you wicked monster ! ' thought prince milan , ' you might as well have put me to death at once . ' sadly he returned to his room , and with bent head sat brooding over his cruel fate till evening . when it grew dark , a little bee flew by , and knocking at the window , it said , ' open , and let me in . ' milan opened the window quickly , and as soon as the bee had entered , it changed into the beautiful hyacinthia . ' good evening , prince milan . why are you so sad ? ' ' how can i help being sad ? your father threatens me with death , and i see myself already without a head . ' ' and what have you made up your mind to do ? ' ' there 's nothing to be done , and after all i suppose one can only die once . '
