" one must be able to adapt one 's self to time and circumstances , and if there is a law that the ' maiden ' is to be called ' hand - rammer , ' why , she must be called ' hand - rammer , ' and no pouting will avail , for everything has its measure . " " no ; if there must be a change , " said the younger , " i should prefer to be called ' missy , ' for that reminds one a little of maidens . " " but i would rather be chopped to chips , " said the elder . at last they all went to work . the maidens rode -- that is , they were put in a wheelbarrow , and that was a distinction ; but still they were called " hand - rammers .
