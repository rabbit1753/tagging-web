' do n't talk so load , or you 'll wake her,'said the old toad . ' she might escape us even now ; she is as light as a feather . we will put her at once on a broad water - lily leaf in the stream . that will be quite an island for her ; she is so small and light . she ca n't run away from us there , whilst we are preparing the guest - chamber under the marsh where she shall live . ' outside in the brook grew many water - lilies , with broad green leaves , which looked as if they were swimming about on the water . the leaf farthest away was the largest , and to this the old toad swam with thumbelina in her walnut - shell .
