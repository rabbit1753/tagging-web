sometimes he was enforced to pass the night in the clefts of old trees or caverns , and to break his fast with the refuse meals of the savage wolves . these at last became his only resource , and he grew to be so little fearful of these animals that he would sit by them while they devoured their meat , and patiently await his share . after a while , the wolves took to little sheem very kindly , and seeming to understand his outcast condition , they would always leave something for him to eat . by and by they began to talk with him , and to inquire into his history . when he told them that he had been forsaken by his brother and his sister , the wolves turned about to each other , lifted up their eyes to heaven , and wondered among themselves , with raised paws , that such a thing should have been . in this way , sheem lived on till the spring , and as soon as the lake was free from ice , he followed his new friends to the shore . it happened on the same day , that his elder brother , owasso , was fishing in his magic canoe , a considerable distance out upon the lake . he thought he heard the cries of a child upon the shore . he wondered how any human creature could exist on so bleak and barren a coast . he listened again with all attention , and he heard the cry distinctly repeated . this time it was the well - known cry of his younger brother that reached his ear . he knew too well the secret of his song , as he heard him chaunting mournfully : " my brother ! my brother ! since you left me going in the canoe , a - hee - ee , i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee . i am half changed into a wolf , e - wee . " owasso made for the shore , and as he approached the lament was repeated . the sounds were very distinct , and the voice of wailing was very sorrowful for owasso to listen to . it touched him the more that it died away at the close , into a long - drawn howl , like that of the wolf .
