' alas ! yes , ' said the miller , ' last night the wolves have eaten our fattest ram there by the kiln not far from here . ' ' ah ! ' said walter , ' do you think that there were many ? ' ' we do n't know , ' answered the miller . ' oh , it is all the same , ' said walter . ' i only asked so that i should know if i should take jonas with me . ' ' i could manage very well alone with three , but if there were more , i might not have time to kill them all before they ran away . ' ' in walter 's place i should go quite alone , it is more manly , ' said jonas . ' no , it is better for you to come too , ' said walter . ' perhaps there are many . ' ' no , i have not time , ' said jonas , ' and besides , there are sure not to be more than three . walter can manage them very well alone . ' ' yes , ' said walter , ' certainly i could . but , you see , jonas , it might happen that one of them might bite me in the back , and i should have more trouble in killing them . if i only knew that there were not more than two i should not mind , for them i should take one in each hand and give them a good shaking , like susanna once shook me .
