' i will , ' answered lasse ; and he went off to the shore . then he opened the shells with a pin , split them carefully in two , and broke small little bits of sticks for the rowers ' seats . then he took the peas which were in the shells and put them in the boats for cargo . some of the shells got broken , some remained whole , and when all were ready lasse had twelve boats . but they should not be boats , they should be large warships . he had three liners , three frigates , three brigs and three schooners . the largest liner was called hercules , and the smallest schooner the flea . little lasse put all the twelve into the water , and they floated as splendidly and as proudly as any great ships over the waves of the ocean . and now the ships must sail round the world . the great island over there was asia ; that large stone africa ; the little island america ; the small stones were polynesia ; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was europe . the whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of the world . the ships of the line steered a straight course to asia , the frigates sailed to africa , the brigs to america , and the schooners to polynesia . but little lasse remained in europe , and threw small stones out into the great sea . now , there was on the shore of europe a real boat , father 's own , a beautiful white - painted boat , and little lasse got into it . father and mother had forbidden this , but little lasse forgot . he thought he should very much like to travel to some other part of the world .
