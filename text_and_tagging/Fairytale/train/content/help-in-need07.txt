my father wished me to marry again ; but i had promised to remain true to the memory of my husband , and made a vow not to comply with my father 's wish . my parents grew angry , and i was obliged to retire to this place in view of their anger . that was three years ago . who could imagine that the contemptible dragon tschauna , who was seeking a wife for his youngest brother , would try to force the wedding - gift upon me ? i refused to accept it ; but tschauna knew how to gain his point with my father , and was determined to carry out his intention . my father , regardless of my wishes , promised me to him . and then the dragon tschauna appeared with his youngest brother and wanted to carry me off by sheer force of arms . i encountered him with fifty faithful followers , and we fought on the meadow before the city . we were defeated , and i am more than ever afraid that tschauna will attempt to drag me off . so i have plucked up courage to beg you to lend me your mercenaries so that i may beat off my foes and remain as i am . if you will help me i will be grateful to you till the end of my days .
