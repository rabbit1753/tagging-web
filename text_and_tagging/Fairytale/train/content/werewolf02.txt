a long time passed , and with each succeeding day the king 's daughter grew taller and more beautiful , and her father granted her every wish . now there were a number of women who had nothing to do but wait on the princess and carry out her commands . among them was a woman who had formerly married and had two daughters . she had an engaging appearance , a smooth tongue and a winning way of talking , and she was as soft and pliable as silk ; but at heart she was full of machinations and falseness . now when the queen died , she at once began to plan how she might marry the king , so that her daughters might be kept like royal princesses . with this end in view , she drew the young princess to her . she paid her the most fulsome compliments on everything she said and did , and was forever bringing the conversation around to how happy she would be were the king to take another wife .
