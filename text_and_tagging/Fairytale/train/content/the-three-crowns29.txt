' well , ' says the king to the elder of the two princes , ' go up to the smith 's forge , take my best coaches , and bring home the bridegroom . ' he did not like doing this , he was so proud , but he could not refuse . when he came to the forge he saw the prince standing at the door , and beckoned him over to the coach . ' are you the fellow , ' says he , ' that made these crowns ? ' ' yes , ' says the other . ' then , ' says he , ' maybe you 'd give yourself a brushing , and get into that coach ; the king wants to see you . i pity the princess . ' the young prince got into the carriage , and while they were on the way he opened the snuff - box , and out walked seven inches , and stood on his thigh . ' well , ' says he , ' what trouble is on you now ? ' ' master , ' says the other , ' please let me go back to my forge , and let this carriage be filled with paving stones . ' no sooner said than done . the prince was sitting in his forge , and the horses wondered what was after happening to the carriage .
