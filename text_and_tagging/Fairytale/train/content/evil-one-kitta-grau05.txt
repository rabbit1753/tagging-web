one day the devil met kitta grau : " where have you been , old man ? " asked kitta grau , for she recognized him . " well , " said the evil one , " i have been out on the farm where the newly wedded couple live . this is the third time i have tried to sow dissension between them . but they think so much of each other that it is a sheer impossibility . " " you talk like a real stupid . that is something i could bring about the very first time i went there , " said kitta grau . " if you can do that , you shall have a splendid pair of shoes , " was the evil one 's reply . " mind you keep your word ! " said kitta , and turned toward the farm . there the woman was home alone , for her husband had gone to the forest . kitta said to the young wife : " you really have a splendid husband . " " do you want to murder me ? " he cried , and gave his wife such a thump that she measured her full length on the floor . and from that day forward there was no peace in the house . now kitta grau was to receive her reward from the evil one . but he was so afraid of her that he did not venture to give her the shoes until he stood on one side of a stream , while she stood on the other , and then he passed them over to her on a long pole . " you are ever so much worse than i am , " he told kitta grau .
