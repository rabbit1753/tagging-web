there was a fiery dragon in that country , and he used to come every seven years , and unless there would be a young woman ready bound before him he would drive the sea through the land , and he would destroy the people . the day came when the dragon was to come , and the lad asked his master to let him go to the place where the dragon was coming . " what 's the business you have there ? " says the master . " there will be horsemen and coaches and great people there , and the crowds will be gathered together in it out of every place . the horses would rise up on top of you , and you would be crushed under their feet ; and it 's better for you to stop at home . " " i 'll stop , " said the lad . but when he got them all gone he went to the castle of the three giants , and he put a saddle on the best steed they had , and a fine suit on himself , and he took the first giant 's sword in his hand , and he went to where the dragon was . it was like a fair there , with the number of riders and coaches and horses and people that were gathered in it . there was a young lady bound to a post on the brink of the sea , and she waiting for the dragon to come to swallow her . it was the king 's daughter that was in it , for the dragon would not take any other woman . when the dragon came out of the sea the lad went against him , and they fought with one another , and were fighting till the evening , until the dragon was frothing at the mouth , and till the sea was red with its blood .
