the monkey thanked the boar many times and then went home . he did not sleep much that night , as you may imagine , for thinking of the morrow . his life depended on whether the boar 's plan succeeded or not . he was the first up , waiting anxiously for what was to happen . it seemed to him a very long time before his master 's wife began to move about and open the shutters to let in the light of day . then all happened as the boar had planned . the mother placed her child near the porch as usual while she tidied up the house and got her breakfast ready . the child was crooning happily in the morning sunlight , dabbing on the mats at the play of light and shadow . suddenly there was a noise in the porch and a loud cry from the child . the mother ran out from the kitchen to the spot , only just in time to see the boar disappearing through the gate with her child in its clutch . she flung out her hands with a loud cry of despair and rushed into the inner room where her husband was still sleeping soundly .
