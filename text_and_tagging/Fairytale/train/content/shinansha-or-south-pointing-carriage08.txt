no matter however strong and brave the emperor 's soldiers were , the rebel with his magic could always escape in the end . kotei returned to his palace , and thought and pondered deeply as to how he should conquer the magician , for he was determined not to give up yet . after a long time he invented the shinansha with the figure of a man always pointing south , for there were no compasses in those days . with this instrument to show him the way he need not fear the dense fogs raised up by the magician to confound his men . kotei again declared war against shiyu . he placed the shinansha in front of his army and led the way to the battlefield . the battle began in earnest . the rebel was being driven backward by the royal troops when he again resorted to magic . upon his saying some strange words in a loud voice , immediately a dense fog came down upon the battlefield . but this time no soldier minded the fog , not one was confused . kotei by pointing to the shinansha could find his way and directed the army without a single mistake . he closely pursued the rebel army and drove them backward till they came to a big river . this river kotei and his men found was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross .
