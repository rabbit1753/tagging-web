the dog was pleased with the plan , which was carried out accordingly . when the father saw the wolf running away with his child he cried out , and when old sultan brought it back again , he was much pleased with him , and patted him , saying , " not a hair of him shall be touched ; he shall have food and shelter as long as he lives . " and he said to his wife , " go home directly and make some good stew for old sultan , something that does not need biting ; and get the pillow from my bed for him to lie on . " from that time old sultan was made so comfortable that he had nothing left to wish for . before long the wolf paid him a visit , to congratulate him that all had gone so well .
