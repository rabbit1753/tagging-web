" listen , " said the neighbor , " there is one thing you must do for me as a favor . " " first let me know what it is , " said the peasant . " you must shift your cow - stable , because it is in my way , " was the answer he gave the peasant . " no , i 'll not do that , " said the peasant . " i put it up only this summer , and the winter is coming on . what am i to do with my cattle then ? " " well , do as you choose ; but if you do not tear it down , you will live to regret it , " said his neighbor . and with that he went his way . the peasant was surprised at this , and did not know what to do . it seemed quite foolish to him to start in to tear down his stable when the long winter night was approaching , and besides , he could not count on help .
