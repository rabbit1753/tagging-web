when the prince did not return , poor hyacinthia wept bitterly and changing herself from a milestone into a little blue field flower , she said , ' i will grow here on the wayside till some passer - by tramples me under foot . ' and one of her tears remained as a dewdrop and sparkled on the little blue flower . now it happened shortly after this that an old man passed by , and seeing the flower , he was delighted with its beauty . he pulled it up carefully by the roots and carried it home . here he planted it in a pot , and watered and tended the little plant carefully . and now the most extraordinary thing happened , for from this moment everything in the old man 's house was changed . when he awoke in the morning he always found his room tidied and put into such beautiful order that not a speck of dust was to be found anywhere . when he came home at midday , he found a table laid out with the most dainty food , and he had only to sit down and enjoy himself to his heart 's content . at first he was so surprised he did n't know what to think , but after a time he grew a little uncomfortable , and went to an old witch to ask for advice . the witch said , ' get up before the cock crows , and watch carefully till you see something move , and then throw this cloth quickly over it , and you 'll see what will happen .
