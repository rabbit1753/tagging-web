the girl was frightened by her father 's severity . never had he spoken to her in such a tone . her confusion changed to apprehension , her color from scarlet to white . she sat dumb and shamefaced , unable to reply . appearances were certainly against her ; the young girl looked guilty , and the father thinking that perhaps after all what his wife had told him was true , spoke angrily : " then , is it really true that you are daily cursing your step - mother and praying for her death ? have you forgotten what i told you , that although she is your step - mother you must be obedient and loyal to her ? what evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so wicked ? you have certainly changed , my daughter ! what has made you so disobedient and unfaithful ? " and the father 's eyes filled with sudden tears to think that he should have to upbraid his daughter in this way .
