on the fifth day of the sixth month he sat in his hall of audience and gave judgment ; and suddenly he felt quite weary and sleepy . he took off his hat and laid down on the cushions . no sooner had he closed his eyes than he saw a warrior in helmet and armor , with a halberd in his hand , standing on the steps leading to the hall , who announced : " a lady is waiting outside who wishes to enter ! " dschou bau asked him : " who are you ? " the answer was : " i am your door - keeper . in the invisible world i already have been performing this duty for many years . " meanwhile two figures clad in green came up the steps , knelt before him and said : " our mistress has come to visit you ! " dschou bau rose . he beheld lovely clouds , from which fell a fine rain , and strange fragrances enchanted him . suddenly he saw a lady clad in a simple gown , but of surpassing beauty , float down from on high , with a retinue of many female servants . these were all neat and clean in appearance , and waited upon the lady as though she were a princess . when the latter entered the hall she raised her arms in greeting . dschou bau came forward to meet her and invited her to be seated . from all sides bright - colored clouds came floating in , and the courtyard was filled with a purple ether . dschou bau had wine and food brought and entertained them all in the most splendid way . but the goddess sat staring straight before her with wrinkled brows , and seemed to feel very sad . then she rose and said with a blush : " i have been living in this neighborhood for many years . a wrong which has been done me , permits me to pass the bounds of what is fitting , and encourages me to ask a favor of you . yet i do not know whether you wish to save me ! " " may i hear what it is all about , " answered dschou bau . " if i can help you , i will be glad to place myself at your disposal . "
