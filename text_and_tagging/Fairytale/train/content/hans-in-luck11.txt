" you must be a knife - grinder like me , " said the man . " all you want is a grindstone , the rest comes of itself : i have one here . to be sure it is a little damaged , but i do n't mind letting you have it in exchange for your goose . what say you ? " " how can you ask ? " answered hans . " i shall be the luckiest fellow in the world . for if i find money whenever i put my hand in my pocket , there is nothing more left to want . " and so he handed over the goose to the pedlar and received the grindstone in exchange . " now , " said the knife - grinder , taking up a heavy common stone that lay near him , " here is another proper sort of stone that will stand a good deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old nails upon . take it with you , and carry it carefully . " hans lifted up the stone and carried it off with a contented mind . " i must have been born under a lucky star ! " cried he , while his eyes sparkled for joy . " i have only to wish for a thing and it is mine . "
