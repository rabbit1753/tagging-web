she looked until it came near , when she perceived that it was another weendigo or giant cannibal . remembering the good conduct of the other , she had no fear of this one , and asked him to look into the lodge . he did so ; and finding after he had glared around , that there was no food at hand , he grew very wroth , and , being sorely disappointed , he took the lodge and threw it to the winds . he seemed hardly at first to notice the woman in his anger ; but presently he cast a fierce glance upon her , and seizing her by the waist , in spite of her cries and entreaties , he bore her off . to the little son , who ran to and fro lamenting , he paid no heed . at night - fall , when the hunter returned from the forest , he was amazed . his lodge was gone , and he saw his son sitting near the spot where it had stood , shedding tears . the son pointed in the direction the weendigo had taken , and as the father hurried along he found the remains of his wife strewn upon the ground . the hunter blackened his face , and vowed in his heart that he would have revenge . he built another lodge , and gathering together the bones of his wife , he placed them in the hollow part of a dry tree .
