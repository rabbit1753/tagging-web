now see what happened . the sausage went away after wood , the bird made up the fire , and the mouse put on the pot , and they waited until the sausage should come home , bringing the wood for the next day . but the sausage was absent so long , that they thought something must have happened to him , and the bird went part of the way to see if he could see anything of him . not far off he met with a dog on the road , who , looking upon the sausage as lawful prey , had picked him up , and made an end of him . the bird then lodged a complaint against the dog as an open and flagrant robber , but it was all no good , as the dog declared that he had found forged letters upon the sausage , so that he deserved to lose his life .
