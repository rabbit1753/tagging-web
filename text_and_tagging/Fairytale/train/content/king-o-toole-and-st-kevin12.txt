' well , honest man , ' says the king , ' and how is it you make your money so easy ? ' ' by makin ' old things as good as new , ' says saint kavin . ' is it a tinker you are ? ' says the king . ' no , ' says the saint ; ' i 'm no tinker by trade , king o'toole . i 've a better thrade than a tinker , ' says he . ' what would you say , ' says he , ' if i made your old goose as good as new ? ' ' my dear , at the word o ' making his goose as good as new , you 'd think the poor old king 's eyes was ready to jump out of his head . ' ' and , ' says he--'truth , then , i 'd give you more money nor you could count , ' says he , ' if you did the like , and i 'd be beholden to you in the bargain . ' ' i scorn your dirty money , ' says saint kavin . ' faith , then , i 'm thinkin ' a trifle o ' change would do you no harm , ' says the king , lookin ' up sly at the old hat that saint kavin had on him . ' i have a vow agin it , ' says the saint . ' i am book sworn , ' says he , ' never to have gold , silver , or brass in my company . ' ' barrin ' the trifle you ca n't help , ' says the king , mighty cute , and looking him straight in the face . ' you just hot it , ' says saint kavin . ' but though i ca n't take money , ' says he , ' i could take a few acres o ' land , if you 'd give them to me . ' ' with all the veins o ' my heart , ' says the king , ' if you can do what you say . ' ' try me ! ' says saint kavin . ' call down your goose here , ' says he , ' and i 'll see what i can do for her . '
