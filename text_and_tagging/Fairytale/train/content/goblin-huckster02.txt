one evening the student came into the shop through the back door to buy candles and cheese for himself ; he had no one to send , and therefore he came himself . he obtained what he wished , and then the huckster and his wife nodded good evening to him . the huckster 's wife was a woman who could do more than merely nod , for she usually had plenty to say for herself . the student nodded also , as he turned to leave , then suddenly stopped and began reading the piece of paper in which the cheese was wrapped . it was a leaf torn out of an old book ; a book that ought not to have been torn up , for it was full of poetry .
