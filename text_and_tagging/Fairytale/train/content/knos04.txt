on the following day knos had to thresh . first he hunted up the largest stone he could find , and rolled it around on the grain , so that all the corn was loosened from the ears . then he had to separate the grain from the chaff . so he made a hole in each side of the roof of the barn , and stood outside the barn and blew , and the chaff and straw flew out into the yard , and the corn remained lying in a heap on the floor . his master happened to come along , laid a ladder against the barn , climbed up and looked down into one of the holes . but knos was still blowing , and the wind caught his master , and he fell down and was nearly killed on the stone pavement of the court .
