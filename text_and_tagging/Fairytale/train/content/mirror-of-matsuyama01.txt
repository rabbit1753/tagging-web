long years ago in old japan there lived in the province of echigo , a very remote part of japan even in these days , a man and his wife . when this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter . she was the joy and pride of both their lives . in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age . what golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood . the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old , her proud mother carrying her , robed in ceremonial kimono , to be put under the patronage of the family 's household god . then her first dolls festival , when her parents gave her a set of dolls and their miniature belongings , to be added to as year succeeded year . then perhaps the most important occasion of all , on her third birthday , when her first obi ( broad brocade sash ) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist . it a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind . now that she was seven years of age , and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents , their cup of happiness seemed full . there could not be found in the whole of the island empire a happier little family .
