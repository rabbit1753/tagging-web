" you think too much of yourself , " said fergus . " it is i that will bring up the child . i am strong . i have knowledge . i am the king 's messenger . no one can stand up against me in honour or riches . i am hardened to war and battles . i am a good craftsman . i am worthy to bring up the child . i am the protector of all the unhappy . the strong are afraid of me . i am the helper of the weak . " " if you will listen to me at last , now you are quiet , " said amergin , " i am able to bring up a child like a king . the people praise my honour , my bravery , my courage , my wisdom . they praise my good luck , my age , my speaking , my name , my courage , and my race . though i am a fighter , i am a poet . i am worthy of the king 's favour . i overcome all the men who fight from their chariots . i owe thanks to no one except conchubar . i obey no one but the king . " then sencha said , " let finchoem keep the child until we come to emain , and morann , the judge , will settle the question when we are there . "
