" this i can give thee , " she said , " and i do it gladly , for these apples are the apples of truth ; and whoso eateth them gaineth this reward , that his lips will never more be able to frame a lie . " thomas took the apple , and ate it ; and for evermore the grace of truth rested on his lips ; and that is why , in after years , men called him " true thomas . " they had only a little way to go after this , before they came in sight of a magnificent castle standing on a hillside . " yonder is my abode , " said the queen , pointing to it proudly . " there dwelleth my lord and all the nobles of his court ; and , as my lord hath an uncertain temper and shows no liking for any strange gallant whom he sees in my company , i pray thee , both for thy sake and mine , to utter no word to anyone who speaketh to thee ; and , if anyone should ask me who and what thou art , i will tell them that thou art dumb . so wilt thou pass unnoticed in the crowd .
