wonderful , indeed , was the result ! the withered tree at once burst into full bloom ! the daimio was so transported with joy that he looked as if he would go mad . he rose to his feet and spread out his fan , calling the old man down from the tree . he himself gave the old man a wine cup filled with the best sake , and rewarded him with much silver and gold and many other precious things . the daimio ordered that henceforth the old man should call himself by the name of hana - saka - jijii , or " the old man who makes the trees to blossom . " henceforth all were to recognize him by this name . he sent him home with great honor .
