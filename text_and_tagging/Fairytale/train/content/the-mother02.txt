" do you not think that i shall save him ? " said she . " our lord will not take him from me ! " and the old man -- it was death himself -- he nodded so strangely , it could just as well signify yes as no . and the mother looked down in her lap , and the tears ran down over her cheeks . her head became so heavy -- she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights . now she slept , but only for a minute , when she started up and trembled with cold . " what is that ? " said she , and looked on all sides . but the old man was gone , and her little child was gone -- he had taken it with him . the old clock in the corner burred , and burred , the great leaden weight ran down to the floor , bump ! and then the clock also stood still . but the poor mother ran out of the house and cried aloud for her child . out there , in the midst of the snow , there sat a woman in long , black clothes . she said , " death has been in thy chamber , and i saw him hasten away with thy little child . he goes faster than the wind , and he never brings back what he takes !
