but the poor girl was in no mood that morning to enjoy the flowers and the birds . instead of watching them , as she generally did , she hid her face in her hands , and wondered what would become of her . she rocked herself to and fro , as she thought how terrible it would be if her mother fulfilled her threat and shut her up in the convent of st . mary , with the grave , solemn - faced sisters , who seemed as if they had completely forgotten what it was like to be young , and run about in the sunshine , and laugh , and pick the fresh spring flowers .
