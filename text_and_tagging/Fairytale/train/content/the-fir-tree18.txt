' and at christmas - time it was the first to be cut down . the axe went deep into the pith ; the tree fell to the ground with a groan ; it felt bruised and faint . it could not think of happiness , it was sad at leaving its home , the spot where it had sprung up ; it knew , too , that it would never see again its dear old companions , or the little shrubs and flowers , perhaps not even the birds . altogether the parting was not pleasant . when the tree came to itself again it was packed in a yard with other trees , and a man was saying , ' this is a splendid one , we shall only want this .
