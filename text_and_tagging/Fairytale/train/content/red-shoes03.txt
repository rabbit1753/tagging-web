karen was now old enough to be confirmed ; she received some new clothes , and she was also to have some new shoes . the rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his own room , in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty shoes and white slippers . it all looked very lovely , but the old lady could not see very well , and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it . amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones , like those which the princess had worn . how beautiful they were ! and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count 's daughter , but that they had not fitted her . " i suppose they are of shiny leather ? " asked the old lady . " they shine so . " " yes , they do shine , " said karen . they fitted her , and were bought . but the old lady knew nothing of their being red , for she would never have allowed karen to be confirmed in red shoes , as she was now to be .
