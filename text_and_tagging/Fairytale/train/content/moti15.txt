but the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with his hands together , gasping . at last , when he got his breath , moti sent him off to bring his king , and to tell him that if he was reasonable his life should be spared . off the poor man went , and by the time the troops of moti 's side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable as possible , he returned with his king . the latter was very humble and apologetic , and promised never to make war any more , to pay a large sum of money , and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished . so the armies on both sides went rejoicing home , and this was really the making of the fortune of clumsy moti , who lived long and contrived always to be looked up to as a fountain of wisdom , valour , and discretion by all except his relations , who could never understand what he had done to be considered so much wiser than anyone else .
