the dragon king did as he was bid , and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left in his quiver . he took the bow , and fitting an arrow to the notch , took careful aim and let fly . the arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head , but instead of penetrating , it glanced off harmless and fell to the ground . nothing daunted , hidesato took another arrow , fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly . again the arrow hit the mark , it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head , only to glance off and fall to the ground . the centipede was invulnerable to weapons ! when the dragon king saw that even this brave warrior 's arrows were powerless to kill the centipede , he lost heart and began to tremble with fear . the warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver , and if this one failed he could not kill the centipede . he looked across the waters . the huge reptile had wound its horrid body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake . nearer and nearer gleamed fireballs of eyes , and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in the still waters of the lake .
