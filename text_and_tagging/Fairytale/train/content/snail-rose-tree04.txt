" no , you have never taken the trouble to think at all . have you ever given yourself an account why you bloomed , and how your blooming comes about -- why just in that way and in no other ? " " no , " said the rose - tree . " i bloom in gladness , because i can not do otherwise . the sun shone and warmed me , and the air refreshed me ; i drank the clear dew and the invigorating rain . i breathed and i lived ! out of the earth there arose a power within me , whilst from above i also received strength ; i felt an ever - renewed and ever - increasing happiness , and therefore i was obliged to go on blooming . that was my life ; i could not do otherwise .
