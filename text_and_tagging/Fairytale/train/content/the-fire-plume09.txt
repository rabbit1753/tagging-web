a day or two before the time set to take his life , he wandered sadly along the shore of the lake . he looked at the glassy water , and more than once the thought to end his griefs by casting himself in its depths , came upon him with such sudden force that it was only by severe self - control that he was able to turn his steps in another direction . he reflected--"they will say that i was guilty if i take my own life . no . i will give them my blood for that of my cousin . " he walked on , with slow steps , but he found no comfort , turn where he would ; the sweet songs of the grove jarred upon his ear ; the beauty of the blue sky pained his sight ; and the soft green earth , as he trode upon it , seemed harsh to his foot , and sent a pang through every nerve . " oh , where is my cousin ? " he kept saying to himself . meanwhile , when wassamo fell senseless before the two young women in the wood , he lost all knowledge of himself until he wakened in a distant scene . he heard persons conversing . one spoke in a tone of command , saying , " you foolish girls , is this the way that you rove about at nights without our knowledge ? put that person you have brought on that couch of yours , and do not let him lie upon the ground .
