little miss muffet had never eaten curds and whey before , and did not know how they tasted ; but she was very hungry , so she took the dish and went into the orchard . she first looked around for a place to sit down , and finally discovered a little grassy mound , which is called a tuffet in the country , and seated herself upon it . then she tasted the curds and whey and found them very good . but while she was eating she chanced to look down at her feet , and there was a great black spider coming straight towards her . the girl had never seen such an enormous and hideous - looking spider before , and she was so frightened that she gave a scream and tipped backward off the tuffet , spilling the curds and whey all over her dress as she did so . this frightened her more than ever , and as soon as she could get upon her feet she scampered away to the farm - house as fast as she could go , crying bitterly as she ran .
