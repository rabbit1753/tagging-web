with that the king whistled , and down came the poor goose , all as one as a hound , waddlin ' up to the poor old cripple , her master , and as like him as two pays . the minute the saint set his eyes on the goose , ' i 'll do the job for you , ' says he , ' king o'toole ! ' ' by jaminee , ' says king o'toole , ' if you do , but i 'll say you 're the cleverest fellow in the seven parishes . ' ' oh , by dad , ' says saint kavin , ' you must say more nor that -- my horn 's not so soft all out , ' says he , ' as to repair your old goose for nothin' . ' what 'll you give me if i do the job for you?--that 's the chat , ' says saint kavin . ' i 'll give you whatever you ask , ' says the king . ' is n't that fair ? ' ' devil a fairer , ' says the saint . ' that 's the way to do business . now , ' says he , ' this is the bargain i 'll make with you , king o'toole : will you give me all the ground the goose flies over , the first offer , after i make her as good as new ? ' ' i will , ' says the king . ' you wo n't go back o ' your word ? ' says saint kavin . ' honor bright ! ' says king o'toole , holdin ' out his fist . ' honor bright , ' says saint kavin back again , ' it 's a bargain , ' says he . ' come here ! ' says he to the poor old goose--'come here , you unfortunate old cripple , ' says he , ' and it 's i that 'll make you the sportin ' bird . '
