the gifts of tobacco , after this , came in even more freely than they had at first ; and as each brought his bundle to the lodge of wassamo , he asked for the usual length of life , for success as a hunter , and for a plentiful supply of food . they particularly desired that the sand - hills might be kept quiet , so that their lands might be moist , and their eyes clear of dust to sight the game . wassamo replied that he would mention each of their requests to his father - in - law . the tobacco was stored in sacks , and on the outside of the skins , that there might be no mistake as to their wants , each one who had given tobacco had painted and marked in distinct characters the totem or family emblem of his family and tribe . these the old sand - spirit could read at his leisure , and do what he thought best for each of his various petitioners . when the time for his return arrived , wassamo warned his people that they should not follow him nor attempt to take note how he disappeared . he then took the moose - skin sacks filled with tobacco , and bade farewell to all but netawis . he insisted on the privilege of attending wassamo and his wife for a distance , and when they reached the sand - banks he expressed the strongest wish to proceed with them on their journey . wassamo told him that it could not be ; that only spirits could exert the necessary power , and that there were no such spirits at hand .
