in the sea of dungting there is a hill , and in that hill there is a hole , and this hole is so deep that it has no bottom . once a fisherman was passing there who slipped and fell into the hole . he came to a country full of winding ways which led over hill and dale for several miles . finally he reached a dragon - castle lying in a great plain . there grew a green slime which reached to his knees . he went to the gate of the castle . it was guarded by a dragon who spouted water which dispersed in a fine mist . within the gate lay a small hornless dragon who raised his head , showed his claws , and would not let him in .
