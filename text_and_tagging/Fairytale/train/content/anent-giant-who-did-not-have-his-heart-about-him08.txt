the next morning the giant got up very early , and went into the forest . no sooner had he gone than the prince and the king 's daughter set about looking for the heart under the threshold of the door . yet no matter how much they dug and searched they found nothing . " this time he has fooled us , " said the princess . " we 'll have to try again . " and she picked the loveliest flowers she could find and strewed them over the threshold which they had put to rights again and when the time drew near for the giant 's return , the king 's son crept under the bed once more . when he was beneath it , the giant came . " hu hu , i smell human flesh ! " he cried . " yes , " said the princess . " a jackdaw flew by with a human bone in her beak , and she let it fall down the chimney . i threw it out at once , but i suppose one can still smell it . " then the giant held his tongue , and said no more about it . after a time he asked who had strewn the flowers over the threshold . " o , i did that , " said the princess . " what does it mean ? " the giant then asked . " o , i am so fond of you that i had to do it , because i know that is where your heart lies . " " yes , of course , " said the giant , " but it does not happen to lie there at all . "
