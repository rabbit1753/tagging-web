the giants used to put -- each man of them -- a shout of him every evening . the people only heard two shouts that evening . " there 's some change in the caher[2 ] to - night , " said the gentleman , when he heard the two shouts . " oh , " says the lad , " i saw one of them going away by himself to - day , and he did not come home yet . " on the next day the lad drove out his cattle until he came to the big stone wall , and he threw a gap in it , and let the cattle into the same place . he went up into a tree and began throwing down the apples . the second giant came running , and said , " what 's the meaning of throwing my wall and letting in your cattle on my estate ? get down out of that at once . you killed my brother yesterday . " " go down , black thong , and bind that one , " says the lad . the thong squeezed him so that he was not able to put a stir out of himself , and he promised the lad anything at all -- only to spare his life . " i am asking nothing of you but the loan of the old sword that is under your bed . " " i 'll give you that , and welcome . " he went in , and brought out the sword with him . each man of them had a sword , and every sword better than another . " try that sword on the six biggest trees that are in the wood , and it will go through them without turning the edge . "
