once upon a time there was a king who went forth into the world and fetched back a beautiful queen . and after they had been married a while god gave them a little daughter . then there was great rejoicing in the city and throughout the country , for the people wished their king all that was good , since he was kind and just . while the child lay in its cradle , a strange - looking old woman entered the room , and no one knew who she was nor whence she came . the old woman spoke a verse over the child , and said that she must not be allowed out under the open sky until she were full fifteen years of age , since otherwise the mountain troll would fetch her . when the king heard this he took her words to heart , and posted guards to watch over the little princess so that she would not get out under the open sky .
