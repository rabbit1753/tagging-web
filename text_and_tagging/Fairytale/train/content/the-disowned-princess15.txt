liu i was angered by the careless way in which tsian tang spoke to him . the blood rose to his head and he replied : " i served as a messenger , because i felt sorry for the princess , but not in order to gain an advantage for myself . to kill a husband and carry off a wife is something an honest man does not do . and since i am only an ordinary man , i prefer to die rather than do as you say . " tsian tang rose , apologized and said : " my words were over - hasty . i hope you will not take them ill ! " and the king of the dungting sea also spoke kindly to him , and censured tsian tang because of his rude speech . so there was no more said about marriage . on the following day liu i took his leave , and the queen of the dungting sea gave a farewell banquet in his honor .
