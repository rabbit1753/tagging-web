' brown bear of norway ! ' said he . ' i do n't understand you . ' ' do n't you remember , prince , that i was your wedded wife for four years ? ' ' i do not , ' said he , ' but i 'm sure i wish it was so . ' ' do n't you remember our three babes that are still alive ? ' ' show me them . my mind is all a heap of confusion . ' ' look for the half of our marriage ring , that hangs at your neck , and fit it to this . ' he did so , and the same moment the charm was broken . his full memory came back on him , and he flung his arms round his wife 's neck , and both burst into tears . well , there was a great cry outside , and the castle walls were heard splitting and cracking . everyone in the castle was alarmed , and made their way out . the prince and princess went with the rest , and by the time all were safe on the lawn , down came the building , and made the ground tremble for miles round . no one ever saw the witch and her daughter afterwards . it was not long till the prince and princess had their children with them , and then they set out for their own palace . the kings of ireland and of munster and ulster , and their wives , soon came to visit them , and may every one that deserves it be as happy as the brown bear of norway and his family .
