once upon a time there was an old cat , called mrs . tabitha twitchit , who was an anxious parent . she used to lose her kittens continually , and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief ! on baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard . she caught moppet and mittens , but she could not find tom . mrs . tabitha went up and down all over the house , mewing for tom kitten . she looked in the pantry under the staircase , and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets . she went right upstairs and looked into the attics , but she could not find him anywhere .
