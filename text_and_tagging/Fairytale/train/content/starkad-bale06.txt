" red fellow ! " answered bale , nine miles away , " the sun and i wake together ! but how goes it with you ? " " none too well . i eat salmon morning , noon and night . come over with a bit of meat ! " " i 'll come ! " bale called back , and in a few hours time he was down in tuna with an elk under each arm . the following morning bale in balbo stood on a hill in borgsjo and called : " red fellow ! are you awake ? " " the sun and i wake together ! " answered starkad . " and how goes it with you ? " " alas , i have nothing to eat but meat ! elk in the morning , elk at noon and elk at night . come over and bring a fish - tail along with you ! " " i 'm coming ! " called out starkad , and in a short time he had joined his friend with a barrel of salmon under each arm . in this fashion the two friends provided themselves with all the game to be found in the woods and in the water , and spread terror and destruction throughout the countryside . but one evening , when they were just returning to the sea from an excursion , a black cloud came up , and a tempest broke . they hurried along as fast as they could ; but got no further than vattjom , where a flash of lightning struck starkad and flung him to the ground . his friend and companion - at - arms buried him beneath a stone cairn , about which he set five rocks : two at his feet , two at his shoulders , and one at his head ; and that grave , measuring twenty ells in length , may still be seen near the river .
