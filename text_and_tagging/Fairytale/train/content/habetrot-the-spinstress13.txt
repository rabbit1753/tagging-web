the next day it was even worse , for her arms ached so much she could only work very slowly . that night she cried herself to sleep ; and next morning , seeing that it was quite hopeless to expect to get her task finished , she threw down her distaff in despair , and ran out of doors . near the house was a deep dell , through which ran a tiny stream . maisie loved this dell , the flowers grew so abundantly there . this morning she ran down to the edge of the stream , and seated herself on a large stone . it was a glorious morning , the hazel trees were newly covered with leaves , and the branches nodded over her head , and showed like delicate tracery against the blue sky . the primroses and sweet - scented violets peeped out from among the grass , and a little water wagtail came and perched on a stone in the middle of the stream , and bobbed up and down , till it seemed as if he were nodding to maisie , and as if he were trying to say to her , " never mind , cheer up . " " and who wants to make a pretty wench like thee into a nun ? more likely that some gallant gentleman should want to make a bride of thee . " " oh , no , " answered maisie , " my mother says no gentleman would look at me because i can not spin . " " nonsense , " said the tiny woman . " spinning is all very well for old folks like me -- my lips , as thou seest , are long and ugly because i have spun so much , for i always wet my fingers with them , the easier to draw the thread from the distaff . no , no , take care of thy beauty , child ; do not waste it over the spinning - wheel , nor yet in a nunnery . " " if my mother only thought as thou dost , " replied the girl sadly ; and , encouraged by the old woman 's kindly face , she told her the whole story . " well , " said the old dame , " i do not like to see pretty girls weep ; what if i were able to help thee , and spin the lint for thee ? "
