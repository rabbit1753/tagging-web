" dear lady , " said the wily badger , " you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old age . wo n't you let me do that for you ? my arms are very strong , and i could relieve you for a little while ! " " thank you for your kindness , " said the old woman , " but i can not let you do this work for me because i must not untie you , for you might escape if i did , and my husband would be very angry if he came home and found you gone . "
