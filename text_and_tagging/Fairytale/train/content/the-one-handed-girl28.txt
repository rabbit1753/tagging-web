full of terror , she made her way back to the bank , and called to the snake , ' my baby is gone!--he is drowned , and never shall i see him again . ' ' go in once more , ' said the snake , ' and feel everywhere , even among the trees that have their roots in the water , lest perhaps he may be held fast there . ' swiftly she went back and felt everywhere with her whole hand , even putting her fingers into the tiniest crannies , where a crab could hardly have taken shelter . ' no , he is not here , ' she cried . ' how am i to live without him ? ' but the snake took no notice , and only answered , ' put in your other arm too . ' ' what is the use of that ? ' she asked , ' when it has no hand to feel with ? ' but all the same she did as she was bid , and in an instant the wounded arm touched something round and soft , lying between two stones in a clump of reeds . ' my baby , my baby ! ' she shouted , and lifted him up , merry and laughing , and not a bit hurt or frightened . ' have you found him this time ? ' asked the snake . ' yes , oh , yes ! ' she answered , ' and , why -- why -- i have got my hand back again ! ' and from sheer joy she burst into tears .
