in the land of the four rivers there dwelt a man who was very rich . one day he got into his wagon and set out on a long journey . and he met a girl , dressed in red , who begged him to take her with him . he allowed her to get into the wagon , and drove along for half - a - day without even looking in her direction . then the girl got out again and said in farewell : " you are truly a good and honest man , and for that reason i must tell you the truth . i am the fire - god . to - morrow a fire will break out in your house . hurry home at once to arrange your affairs and save what you can ! " frightened , the man faced his horses about and drove home as fast as he could . all that he possessed in the way of treasures , clothes and jewels , he removed from the house . and , when he was about to lie down to sleep , a fire broke out on the hearth which could not be quenched until the whole building had collapsed in dust and ashes . yet , thanks to the fire - god , the man had saved all his movable belongings .
