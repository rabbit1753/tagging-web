when he set his foot on dry land again he felt hungry . at once a table stood before him , covered with a fine and plenteous meal . he ate and drank . after he had gone on a while , he felt weary . and there stood an ass , waiting for him , on which he mounted . after he had ridden for a while , the ass 's gait seemed too uneven , and along came a wagon , into which he climbed . but the wagon shook him up too , greatly , and he thought : " if i only had a litter ! that would suit me better . " no more had he thought so , than the litter came along , and he seated himself in it . and the bearers carried him to the city in which dwelt the king , the queen and their daughter . and this was on the very day that the litter arrived . the king 's daughter saw the half of her silken handkerchief in the youth 's hand , and filled with joy , she led him to her father . there he had to show his half of the long pin , which fitted the other exactly , and then the king was convinced that he was the right , true deliverer . the false bridegroom was now punished , the wedding celebrated , and they lived in peace and happiness till the end of their days .
