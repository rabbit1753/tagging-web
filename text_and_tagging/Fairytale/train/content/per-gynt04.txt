" well , whether you be crooked or straight , you will have to let me pass , " said per gynt . he noticed that he was going around in a circle , and that the crooked one had coiled himself about the herdsman 's cottage . at these words the crooked one moved a little to one side , so that per gynt could get into the cottage . when he entered he found it as dark inside as it was out . he stumbled and felt his way along the walls . he wanted to lay aside his firelock and his hunting - bag . but while he was feeling his way about , he once more noticed the something large , and cold and slippery . " and who are you now ? " cried per gynt . " o , i am the big crooked one , " was the answer . and no matter where he took hold or where he set his foot , he could feel the coils of the crooked one laid around him . " this is a poor place to be in , " thought per gynt , " for this crooked one is outside and inside . i will soon put what is wrong to rights . " he took his firelock , went out again , and felt his way along the crooked one until he came to his head .
