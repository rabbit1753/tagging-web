the next day -- well , perhaps we had better pass over the next day . the evening had come , and the lamp was resting in a grandfather 's chair ; and guess where ! why , at the old watchman 's house . he had begged as a favor that the mayor and corporation would allow him to keep the street lamp in consideration of his long and faithful service , as he had himself hung it up and lighted it on the day he first commenced his duties , four and twenty years ago . he looked upon it almost as his own child . he had no children , so the lamp was given to him .
