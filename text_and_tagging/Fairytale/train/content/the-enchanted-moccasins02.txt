he traveled on till he came to a small wigwam , and on looking into it he discovered a very old woman sitting alone by the fire . as soon as she saw the stranger , she invited him in , and thus addressed him : " my poor grandchild , i suppose you are one of those who seek for the distant village , from which no person has ever yet returned . unless your guardian is more powerful than the guardians of those who have gone before you , you will share a similar fate to theirs . be careful to provide yourself with the invisible bones they use in the medicine - dance , for without these you can not succeed . " after she had thus spoken , she gave him the following directions for his journey : " when you come near to the village which you seek , you will see in the center a large lodge , in which the chief of the village , who has two daughters , resides . before the door there is a great tree , which is smooth and without bark . on this tree , about the height of a man from the ground , is hung a small lodge , in which these two false daughters dwell . it is here that so many have been destroyed , and among them your two elder brothers . be wise , my grandchild , and abide strictly by my directions .
