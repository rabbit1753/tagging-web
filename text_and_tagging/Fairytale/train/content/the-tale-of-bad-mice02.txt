one morning lucinda and jane had gone out for a drive in the doll 's perambulator . there was no one in the nursery , and it was very quiet . presently there was a little scuffling , scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace , where there was a hole under the skirting - board . tom thumb put out his head for a moment , and then popped it in again . tom thumb was a mouse . a minute afterwards hunca munca , his wife , put her head out , too ; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery , she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal - box . the doll 's house stood at the other side of the fireplace . tom thumb and hunca munca went cautiously across the hearth - rug . they pushed the front door -- it was not fast .
