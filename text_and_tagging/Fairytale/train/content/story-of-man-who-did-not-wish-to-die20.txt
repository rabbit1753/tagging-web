at midnight of the seventh day , as sentaro knelt in the temple , the door of the innermost shrine flew open . jofuku appeared in a luminous cloud , and calling to sentaro to come nearer , spoke thus : " your desire is a very selfish one and can not be easily granted . you think that you would like to become a hermit so as to find the elixir of life . do you know how hard a hermit 's life is ? a hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees . a hermit must cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every earthly desire . gradually after following these strict rules , the hermit ceases to feel hunger or cold or heat . his body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp , and can walk on water without getting his feet wet .
